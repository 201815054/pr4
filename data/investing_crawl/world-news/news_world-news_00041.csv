WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States could consider ending a suspension of security assistance to Pakistan, if Islamabad takes ""decisive and sustained"" actions against militant groups in the country, the State Department's No. 2 official said on Tuesday.
""We may consider lifting the suspension when we see decisive and sustained actions to address our concerns, including targeting all terrorist groups operating within its territory, without distinction,"" Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Sullivan, however, told the committee the Trump administration has so far seen no evidence that Pakistan has met its demands for a crackdown on extremist groups operating on Pakistani territory.
The U.S. government last month said it was suspending at least $900 million in security assistance to Pakistan until it takes action against the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network militant groups.
Pakistan has long rejected accusations that it fails to tackle militants battling the government in neighboring Afghanistan and U.S.-led foreign forces there, from sanctuaries on its side of the border.

After Washington announced the aid suspension, Pakistan criticized what it called ""shifting goalposts"" and said the move was counter-productive.

Netanyahu has been cautioning against any attempt by Iran to deepen its military foothold in Syria or construct missile factories in neighboring Lebanon.
Lebanon's top three leaders accused Israel on Tuesday of threatening the stability of the border region between them amid rising tension over territorial and maritime boundaries.
""We seek peace but are prepared for any scenario and I wouldn't suggest to anyone that they test us,"" Netanyahu said in broadcast remarks during the Golan visit.
He did not mention Iran or its Lebanese militia ally, Hezbollah, both main players in Syria's civil war, by name.

Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor who has already run twice for the presidency, leads the pack with 38 percent, up 3 percentage points since November, according to the survey in business newspaper El Financiero. 
Support for Ricardo Anaya, the former chairman of the conservative National Action Party (PAN) now leading a right-left coalition, grew 7 points to 27 percent. Former finance minister Jose Antonio Meade of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has 22 percent, up 2 points. 
While Meade remains in third place, his public recognition is improving, rising to 83 percent at present from 43 percent in November, the poll found. 
His campaign has been dogged by a backlash against the PRI, which has faced a series of corruption scandals. 
If Meade fails to gain traction, the election could turn into a head-to-head contest between Lopez Obrador and Anaya.
While Lopez Obrador has been a polarizing figure in Mexican politics, the poll found he was the only candidate who has more positive ratings than negative ratings. 

Pollster Alejandro Moreno carried out the survey for El Financiero between Jan. 27 and Jan. 31, conducting 1,002 face-to-face interviews. The poll has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - More than six years after they were forced to leave their homes in the civil war that toppled Muammar Gaddafi, tens of thousands of residents of the Libyan ghost city of Tawergha were finally meant to start going home last week. It never happened.
Armed groups blocked the road, shattering the hopes of families, casting a long-negotiated settlement into doubt, and demonstrating yet again the human cost of life in a country ruled by men with guns who appear to answer to no one.
The case of Tawergha, a city built among date palm groves about 200 km (124 miles) south-east of Tripoli, has become a symbol of division and conflict in Libya following the Nato-backed uprising against Gaddafi. 
Tawergha was used by pro-Gaddafi forces attacking the nearby city of Misrata during the war. After the fighting, Misrata forces emptied Tawergha of its inhabitants. The city was abandoned as a ghost town, while its residents, many the dark-skinned descendents of sub-Saharan African slaves, lived in squalid temporary camps.
After years of negotiations, the Tawergha residents were finally meant to start going home on Feb. 1. But after days on the road they said militia fighters never let them through.
""My kids were carrying doves with them to release as a sign of peace, and they were carrying olive branches too,"" said one woman at a camp for displaced people on Tripoli's airport road whose family tried to reach the city in a convoy.
""The elders stopped the cars and asked us to wait,"" said the woman, who asked not to be identified for security reasons. ""Suddenly the cars were driving fast and there was shooting.""
""We were asked (by the elders) to wait until the problem could be solved. But after three days, and with the shooting at us, my son started crying uncontrollably. His dream has collapsed.""
More than six years since Gaddafi was captured hiding in a sewer and killed, Libya still has no government that can exercise control of the streets.
The internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli is opposed by a rival government and allied factions in eastern Libya. Towns and cities are largely carved up between militia groups, many of which draw salaries from the state but answer only loosely at best to either government.
The GNA had promoted the return to Tawergha as a major breakthrough. But when convoys of residents tried to approach the town last week from the west, armed men from GNA-linked brigades halted them.
Other residents were turned back approaching from the east, before reaching Sirte, controlled by Misrata since forces led by the city's brigades ousted Islamic State from the city in 2016. 
Officials from Misrata, itself divided between moderate and hardline groups, had called for a delay to the planned returns, saying more preparations were needed to ensure security for returnees, and arguing that some terms of a 2016 deal between Misrata and the Tawerghans had not been fulfilled.
Yousef Zerzah, chairman of Misrata's dialogue committee with Tawergha, defended the groups that halted the returns. 
""They have some legitimate demands, including some points of the agreement between Misrata and Tawergha, such as recognition of the revolution of February 17 (2011), and an official apology from Tawergha authorities to the people of Misrata,"" he said at a press conference. 
The U.N. mission in Libya blamed the reversal on ""some extremist elements"", and denounced ""attempts at financial extortion in exchange for (residents') return"".
Tawergha remains abandoned and in ruins, and it is not clear how residents can resettle there before basic infrastructure has been restored. Still, the GNA, which has struggled to impose its authority in the capital and beyond, had tried to mediate a solution to the stand-off.

""We held a meeting with municipality of Misrata, the commander of central military region, and the commander of military police,"" Yousef Jallalah, minister of refugees and displaced people, told reporters on Monday. ""The meeting lasted till midnight but we didn't get a positive result.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Tuesday it had the right to put weapons anywhere it chose on its own territory, after reports that Moscow had deployed nuclear-capable Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad drew criticism from its neighbors and NATO.
From Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea, the missiles would be able to reach large swathes of territory in NATO-members Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
The president of Lithuania, which neighbors Kaliningrad, and a senior Russian lawmaker, both said the missile systems had been deployed to the region. Russia has not confirmed the deployment.
Asked about reports of the deployment on a conference call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The deployment of one weapon or another, the deployment of military units and so forth on Russian territory, is exclusively a sovereign issue for the Russian Federation.
""Russia has never threatened anyone and is not threatening anyone. Naturally, Russia has this sovereign right (to deploy weapons on its own territory). It should hardly be cause for anyone to worry."" 
The Baltic states are already within range of longer-range Russian missiles. But reports of the Kaliningrad deployment so close to NATO territory are perceived by some alliance members as a threat at a time when tensions between Russia and its Western neighbors are running high over Moscow's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula.
""This again makes the situation even more serious because Iskanders in Kaliningrad means dangers for half of European capitals,"" Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said on Monday.
Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said the deployment added fresh impetus to discussions already underway inside NATO about improving the alliance's capabilities.
""It means that what we have been talking about - the necessity to discuss strengthening air-defense elements during the NATO summit in July; strengthening the chain of command, to talk about many questions that affect defense of our region and Latvia specifically ... - it all has been confirmed by the practical actions of Russia,"" the minister said.  
The Kremlin has often said it would place Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad as a riposte to a U.S. missile shield being developed in eastern Europe. Washington says that shield is designed to counter possible missile attacks by Iran, but Moscow says it is directed against Russia.
A NATO official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: ""Any deployment close to our borders of missiles that can carry nuclear warheads does not help to lower tensions. In the spirit of transparency, we look forward to hearing more from Russia on this.

""It is important to determine the exact situation. NATO is alert, we understand the capability, but we also understand that the Russians have been moving equipment in and out of Kaliningrad for a long time.""

Abdeslam, who is charged with the attempted murder of police in a shoot-out with officers in Brussels three days before he was arrested in March 2016, refused to answer questions on the first day of the trial on Monday.
Abdeslam traveled to the court from a prison close to Paris on Monday - but told the hearing he was tired and had barely slept.
He was taken to another French prison close to the Belgian border on Monday night. The court's president said Abdeslam had now decided he did not wish to appear again on Thursday.
Police said Abdeslam fled Paris on the night in November 2015 when attackers including his elder brother killed 130 people.

Police conducted what they thought would be a routine search related to the Paris attacks at an apartment in the Brussels district of Forest in March 2016.

7,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 09:23AM ET</span>","Special Report: In Puerto Rico, a housing crisis U.S. storm aid won't solve","By Nick Brown
CANOVANAS, Puerto Rico (Reuters) - Among the countless Puerto Rico neighborhoods battered by Hurricane Maria is one named after another storm: Villa Hugo. The illegal shantytown emerged on a public wetland after 1989’s Hurricane Hugo left thousands homeless.
About 6,000 squatters landed here, near the El Yunque National Forest, and built makeshift homes on 40 acres that span a low-lying valley and its adjacent mountainside. Wood and concrete dwellings, their facades scrawled with invented addresses, sit on cinder blocks. After Maria, many are missing roofs; some have collapsed altogether.
Amid the rubble, 59-year-old Joe Quirindongo sat in the sun one recent day on a wooden platform - the only remaining piece of his home. Soft-spoken with weathered skin and a buzzcut, Quirindongo pondered his limited options.
“I know this isn’t a good place for a house,” said Quirindongo, who survives on U.S. government assistance. “Sometimes I would like to go to another place, but I can’t afford anything.”
Villa Hugo reflects a much larger crisis in this impoverished U.S. territory, where so-called “informal” homes are estimated to house about half the population of 3.4 million. Some residents built on land they never owned. Others illegally subdivided properties, often so family members could build on their lots.
Most have no title to their homes, which are constructed without permits and usually not up to building codes. The houses range in quality and size, from one-room shacks to sizable family homes. Many have plumbing and power, though not always through official means.
(For a Wider Image photo essay on the island's post-Maria housing crisis, see: http://reut.rs/2EJmIq3 )
The concentration of illegal housing presents a vexing dilemma for local and federal authorities already overwhelmed by the task of rebuilding an economically depressed island after its worst natural disaster in nine decades.
Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló has stressed the need to “build back better,” a sentiment echoed by U.S. disaster relief and housing officials. But rebuilding to modern standards or relocating squatters to new homes would take an investment far beyond reimbursing residents for lost property value. It’s an outlay Puerto Rico’s government says it can’t afford, and which U.S. officials say is beyond the scope of their funding and mission.
Yet the alternative - as Villa Hugo shows - is to encourage rebuilding of the kind of substandard housing that made the island so vulnerable to Maria in the first place.
“It’s definitely a housing crisis,” said Fernando Gil, Puerto Rico’s housing secretary. “It was already out there before, and the hurricane exacerbates it.”
In Puerto Rico, housing is by far the largest category of storm destruction, estimated by the island government at about $37 billion, with only a small portion covered by insurance. That's more than twice the government’s estimate for catastrophic electric grid damage, which was made far worse by the shoddy state of utility infrastructure before the storm.
Puerto Rico officials did not respond to questions about how the territory estimated the damage to illegally built homes.
Maria destroyed or significantly damaged more than a third of about 1.2 million occupied homes on the island, the government estimates. Most of those victims had no hazard insurance - which is only required for mortgage-holders in Puerto Rico - and no flood insurance. Just 344,000 homes on the island have mortgages, according U.S. Census Bureau data.
Officials at the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA) acknowledged the unique challenges of delivering critical housing aid to Puerto Rico. Among them: calculating the damage to illegal, often substandard homes; persuading storm victims to follow through on application processes that have frustrated many into giving up; and allocating billions in disaster aid that still won’t be nearly enough solve the island’s housing crisis.
By far the most money for Puerto Rico housing aid is expected to come from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
HUD spokeswoman Caitlin Thompson declined to comment on how the agency would spend billions of dollars in disaster relief funds to rebuild housing, or how it planned to help owners of informally built homes. Two HUD officials overseeing the agency’s Puerto Rico relief efforts, Todd Richardson and Stan Gimont, also declined to comment.
But the disaster aid package currently under consideration by the U.S. Congress would provide far less housing aid than Puerto Rico officials say they need. Governor Rosselló is seeking $46 billion in aid from HUD, an amount that dwarfs previous allocations for even the most destructive U.S. storms.
That's nearly half the island's total relief request of $94 billion. 
The U.S. House of Representatives instead passed a package of $81 billion, with $26 billion for HUD, that still needs Senate and White House approval. The money would be divided between regions struck by several 2017 hurricanes - including Maria, Harvey in Texas and Irma in Florida - as well as the recent California wildfires. Congress could also decide to approve additional aid later.
‘MY MOTHER IS SCARED’
A generation ago, Maria Vega Lastra, now 61, was among the estimated 28,000 people displaced by Hurricane Hugo. Neighbors helped her build a new home in what would become Villa Hugo, in the town of Canóvanas.
Her daughter, 34-year-old Amadaliz Diaz, still recalls her older brother grinning as he sawed wood for the frame of their self-built, one-floor house, with a porch and three bedrooms.
Now, Vega Lastra’s roof has holes in it, and her waterlogged wooden floorboards buckle with each step.
Vega Lastra has been staying with her daughter, who lives in Tampa, as the family waits on applications for FEMA aid. The agency initially denied her application in December, saying it could not contact her by phone, Diaz said.
Vega Lastra is returning to her home this week, uncertain if its condition has gotten worse. Her daughter bought her an air mattress to take with her.
“My mother is scared,” Diaz said. “I hope the government helps her. I work, but I have three kids to take care of.”
The island’s housing crisis long predated the storm. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency data, Puerto Rico’s index of new home prices fell 25 percent over the last decade, amid a severe recession that culminated last May in the largest government bankruptcy filing in U.S. history.
Legal home construction, meanwhile, plummeted from nearly 16,000 new units in 2004 to less than 2,500 last year, according to consultancy Estudios Tecnicos, an economic data firm.
A 2007 study by environmental consultant Interviron Services Inc, commissioned by the Puerto Rico Builders Association, found that 55 percent of residential and commercial construction was informal. That would work out to nearly 700,000 homes.
That figure might be high, said David Carrasquillo, president of the Puerto Rico Planning Society, a trade group representing community planners. But even a “very conservative” estimate would yield at least 260,000 illegally built houses, he said.
Generations of Puerto Rican governments never made serious efforts to enforce building codes to stop new illegal housing, current and former island officials said in interviews. Past administrations had little political or economic incentive to force people out of neighborhoods like Villa Hugo. 
Former Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon, in office during Hurricane Hugo, said he tried to help informal homeowners without policing them. “Our policy was not to relocate, but rather improve those places,” Hernandez Colon said in an interview.
Subsequent administrations advocated similar policies; none made meaningful headway, partly because of Puerto Rico’s constant political turnover.
Today, informal communities provide a stark contrast to San Juan’s glittering resorts and bustling business districts. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz pointed to poor barrios like those near the city's Martín Peña Channel, hidden behind the skyscrapers of the financial hub known as the Golden Mile.
“It’s not something I’m proud of, but we hide our poverty here,” Cruz said in an interview.
RECOVERY DILEMMA
The task of rebuilding Puerto Rico’s housing stock ultimately falls to the territory government, which has no ability to pay for it after racking up $120 billion in bond and pension debt in the years before the storm.
That leaves the island dependent on U.S. relief from FEMA, the SBA and HUD.
The SBA offers low-interest home repair loans of up to $200,000. FEMA provides homeowners with emergency grants, relocation assistance and other help. HUD is focused on long-term rebuilding efforts, working directly with local agencies to subsidize reconstruction through grants.
FEMA’s cap for disaster aid to individuals is $33,300, and actual awards are often much lower. Normally, FEMA eligibility for housing aid requires proving property ownership, but the agency says it will help owners of informal homes if they can prove residency.
How exactly to help gets complicated. For example, someone who builds their own home with no permits on land they own is more likely to be treated as a homeowner, said Justo Hernandez, FEMA’s deputy federal coordinating officer. Squatters who built on land they didn't own, however, would likely only be given money to cover lost items and relocate to a rental, he said.
Several Villa Hugo residents said they received money from FEMA, but many didn’t know what it was for and complained it wasn’t enough.
Lourdes Rios Romero, 59, plans to appeal the $6,000 grant she got for repairs to her flooded home, citing a much higher contractor’s quote. Neighbor Miguel Rosario Lopez, a 62-year-old retiree, showed a statement from FEMA saying he was eligible for $916.22, “to perform essential repairs that will allow you to live in your home.”
Without money for major changes, most homeowners said they planned to combine the aid they might get from FEMA with what little money they could raise to rebuild in the same spot.
FEMA does not police illegal building. Code enforcement is left to the same local authorities who have allowed illegal construction to persist for years.
Quirindongo is planning to buy materials to rebuild his Villa Hugo home himself with about $4,000 from FEMA. It will be the third time he has done so, having lost one home to a 2011 flood, another to a fire. 
“I just want to have something that I can say, ‘This is mine,’” Quirindongo said.
GIVING UP 
Many others appear to have given up on FEMA aid because the agency’s application process is entangled with a separate process for awarding SBA loans to rebuild homes.
FEMA is legally bound to assess whether applicants might qualify for SBA loans before awarding them FEMA grants. If an applicant passes FEMA’s cursory eligibility assessment, they are automatically referred to SBA for a more thorough screening. 
Applicants are not required to follow through on the SBA process - but they cannot qualify for FEMA aid unless they do. FEMA only provides a grant when the SBA denies the applicant a loan.
FEMA said it has referred about 520,000 people out of 1.1 million total applicants so far to the SBA. But as of Monday, only 59,000 followed through with SBA applications. Of those, some 12,000 later withdrew, SBA data shows.
“As soon as people see SBA they say, ‘I give up, I don’t want a loan - I can’t afford a loan,’” FEMA's Hernandez said.
SBA spokeswoman Carol Chastang said the agency is working with FEMA to educate flood victims on available benefits and the application process, including sending staffers to applicants’ homes.
330,000 VACANT HOMES
Before the storm hit, Puerto Rico already had about 330,000 vacant homes, according to Census Bureau 2016 estimates, resulting from years of population decline as citizens migrated to the mainland United States and elsewhere. Puerto Ricans are American citizens and can move to the mainland at will.
Puerto Rico and federal officials have considered rehabilitating the vacant housing for short- and long-term use, along with building new homes and buying out homeowners in illegally built neighborhoods, according to Gil and federal officials.
Rosselló, the Puerto Rican governor, has said the rebuilding plan must include a fleet of properly built new homes. Gil, the housing secretary, said the administration would like to build as many as 70,000 properties. 
HUD officials declined to comment on whether the agency would finance new housing. Its Community Development Block Grant program allows for local governments to design their own solutions and seek HUD approval for funding.
The cost of constructing enough new, code-compliant properties to house people displaced by Maria could far exceed the available federal aid. Making them affordable also presents a problem.
Puerto Rico’s subsidized “social interest housing,” geared toward low-income buyers, typically provides units that sell in the mid-$100,000 range, with prices capped by the government. That’s beyond the means of many displaced storm victims.
Gil offered little detail on a solution beyond saying it will include a mix of new development, buyout programs for owners of illegally built homes and other options.
The answer will come down to how much Washington is willing to pay, he said. He invoked the island’s territorial status and colonial history as a root cause of its poor infrastructure and housing stock before the storm.
“It is precisely because we have been neglected by the federal government that the island’s infrastructure is so weak,” he said.
Many Puerto Rico officials continue to advocate for bringing relief and legitimacy to squatter communities like Villa Hugo, rather than trying to relocate their residents. 
Canovanas Mayor Lornna Soto has been negotiating with island officials to provide property titles to Villa Hugo’s population. The vast majority still don’t have them. 
“It’s long overdue to recognize that they are not going anywhere and their communities need to be rebuilt with proper services,” Soto said. 
Diaz said she supports her mother's decision to return to Villa Hugo, regardless of what aid the government ultimately provides. 

“I grew up there,” Diaz said. “Everyone knows us there.”

JUBA (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters massed outside the U.S. embassy and U.N. headquarters in South Sudan's capital on Tuesday, chanting slogans against an arms embargo imposed by Washington, before some attacked journalists at the scene.
The demonstrators handed in a petition to the United Nations, then some in the crowd turned on reporters, punching them and throwing stones, witnesses said. One foreign journalist needed medical treatment. 
""She was targeted because when the demonstrators saw her, they said 'Why is the white person taking our photos?' ... they beat her,"" said a local journalist who asked not to be named. 
The United States banned the export of weapons and defense services to South Sudan on Friday, in a bid to press President Salva Kiir to end a four-year-old civil war.
Washington has already blacklisted several South Sudanese figures - the former army chief and several former or serving officers, a businessman and the information minister - that it says have helped stoke the conflict, which has triggered Africa's biggest refugee crisis since the Rwandan genocide.
Protesters held banners denouncing colonialism and chanted ""America mind your own business, stop the arms embargo against South Sudan"". 
“We are ready to defend South Sudan from any foreign invaders and oppression even if it means to die,"" read the petition, presented by Gatluak Bol Dhew, the acting secretary general of South Sudan National Youth - a youth group which says it is not linked to the government or any political party. 
The petition praised China - which has large investments in South Sudan's oil industry - and Russia as ""true friends"" of the country. 
More than a third of the population has been driven from their homes by the fighting, which had exacerbated ethnic divisions, splitting the oil-rich nation into a patchwork of fiefdoms. 
Internationally-backed attempts to mediate a peace deal or ceasefire have repeatedly failed, and deadly attacks on aid workers trying to tackle widespread hunger, poverty and disease are common. 
Police spokesman Daniel Boulogne said they were unaware of any violence at the demonstration. 
When asked about the attacks on journalists, he said ""this was not reported to us."" 
The United Nations Mission in South Sudan said the demonstration was largely peaceful, but added that ""a small group of those gathered outside threw stones at the main gate of the base"".

GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea is only months away from obtaining the capability to hit U.S. territory with a nuclear weapon and must be disarmed, a U.S. envoy said on Tuesday, dismissing Pyonyang's diplomatic thaw with South Korea as a ""charm offensive"" that fooled no one.
In a diplomatic showdown at a U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament, North Korea responded by blaming Washington for escalating confrontation, saying it was deploying nuclear assets including aircraft carriers near the divided peninsula and was considering a pre-emptive strike against Pyongyang.
""North Korea has accelerated its provocative pursuit of nuclear weapons and missile capabilities, and expressed explicit threats to use nuclear weapons against the United States and its allies in the region,"" U.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood told the Geneva forum.
""North Korean officials insist that they will not give up nuclear weapons, and North Korea may now be only months away from the capability to strike the United States with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles,"" he said.
A new U.S. nuclear policy review outlined last week ""reaffirms that North Korea’s illicit nuclear program must be completely, verifiably, and irreversibly eliminated, resulting in a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons,"" he said.
Asked later what the basis was for the assessment that North Korea would soon be able to hit the United States with a nuclear weapon, he said he had ""no new information to share"".
North Korea tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile, the Hwasong-14, twice last July. In November it tested the Hwasong-15, believed to be capable of reaching the continental United States. It is not yet believed to have the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile.
North Korea is under tightening U.N. Security Council sanctions for its banned nuclear and ballistic missile programs. But recent weeks have seen a thaw with South Korea, after Pyongyang agreed to send athletes to compete in the Olympic Games opening on Feb. 9 in the south.
""CHARM OFFENSIVE""
""What I would call 'the charm offensive' frankly is fooling no one,"" Wood told the talks.
He also said arsenals in China and Russia were expanding, drawing rebukes from their respective delegations. 
""Russia, China and North Korea are growing their stockpiles, increasing the prominence of nuclear weapons in their security strategies, and - in some cases - pursuing the development of new nuclear capabilities to threaten other peaceful nations,"" Wood said. 
""We are not going to stick our head in the sand, we are going to respond to these growing challenges,"" he later told reporters.
North Korea accused the United States of seeking to aggravate the situation on the divided peninsula by ""deploying large nuclear assets"" nearby, laying the ground for a possible pre-emptive strike against it.
""In view of the nature and scale of U.S. military reinforcements, they are designed to make a pre-emptive strike against the DPRK,"" North Korean diplomat Ju Yong Chol told the talks, referring to his country's official name the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
""U.S. officials including the defense secretary and the CIA director repeatedly talked about DPRK nuclear and missile threat to justify their argument for a military option and a new concept of a so-called 'bloody nose', a limited pre-emptive strike on the DPRK is under consideration within the U.S. administration,"" Ju said.

He said President Donald Trump's 'America First' doctrine and U.S. nuclear superiority would endanger global peace and security and ""trigger off a new nuclear arms race and could bring the whole world close to a horrible catastrophe"".

A U.S. official in Baghdad said: ""We take anything that sounds like a threat from anyone against Americans seriously."" 
""There's not that many of us here and we are all operating within Iraqi military bases. A lot of this is frankly just political posturing and trying to take advantage of stories in the press to make broader political points,"" he added.
The U.S.-led international military coalition helped Iraqi forces recapture territory taken by Islamic State in 2014 and 2015, providing air and artillery support in the battle to for Mosul, and trained tens of thousands of elite Iraqi soldiers.
""The Coalition will tailor our forces in consultation with our Iraqi partners in order to ensure the lasting defeat of Daesh (Islamic State),"" the coalition's director of operations, Brigadier General Jonathan Braga, said in a statement on Monday. 
Braga said that even if the composition of the force changes, the coalition would maintain the capabilities and presence to continue to train, advise and equip Iraqi forces to ensure that Islamic State does not re-emerge. 
U.S. officials say that while Islamic State has lost most of the territory it once controlled in Iraq and Syria, there is concern about surviving fighters returning to insurgency tactics.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's top three leaders accused Israel on Tuesday of threatening the stability of the border region between them, amid rising tension over territorial and maritime boundaries.
President Michel Aoun, Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri agreed to act to stop Israel from building a wall on Lebanese land at the border, and infringing on an energy block in disputed waters.
Arguments over the wall and Lebanon's plans to explore for offshore oil and gas have elevated tensions between Israel and Lebanon. 
Calm has largely prevailed along the frontier since 2006, when Israel fought a war with Lebanon's heavily-armed Shi'ite Hezbollah movement. 
The month-long conflict killed about 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 Israelis, most of them troops. There has been no major confrontation between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah since. 
Israel has said the border wall is being built on its territory. The Lebanese government says it passes through land that belongs to Lebanon but lies on the Israeli side of the Blue Line, where the U.N. demarcated Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000.
The three Lebanese leaders met to study recent ""Israeli threats, and saw in them ... a direct threat to the stability"" of the border region, the president's office said in a statement.
They agreed to act ""at various regional and international levels to prevent Israel from building the cement wall...and from the possibility of infringing on Lebanon's oil and gas wealth and its (territorial) waters."" 
Aoun, Berri, and Hariri will present a series of measures to Lebanon's Higher Defense Council and security officials at a meeting on Wednesday, it said. 
Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman called Lebanon's first offshore oil and gas exploration tender ""very provocative"" and urged international firms not to participate last week. 
Lebanon has an unresolved maritime border dispute with Israel over a triangular area of sea of around 860 sq km (330 square miles). The zone extends along the edge of three out of five energy blocks that Lebanon put to tender early last year.

Lebanon in December approved a bid by a consortium of France's Total, Italy's Eni and Russia's Novatek for two blocks.

AJACCIO, France (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron traveled to Corsica on Tuesday to confront demands for greater autonomy for the restive Mediterranean island by nationalists buoyed by unprecedented political strength.
Macron paid homage to Claude Erignac, the island's prefect who was shot dead by separatists in Ajaccio two decades ago, and will later meet nationalist leaders before setting out his vision for Corsica in a speech on Wednesday.
Corsica's relationship with mainland France has long troubled French presidents. Separatists waged a 40-year militant campaign, blowing up police stations and mansions owned by mainlanders and carrying out assassinations, before laying down arms in 2014.
Since then, the same dissatisfaction with mainstream parties that has spurred secessionist ambitions elsewhere in Europe, such as Catalonia, has bolstered the nationalists' political support. In December, the two-party ""Pe a Corsica"" (For Corsica) nationalist alliance won nearly two-thirds of seats in the regional assembly.
Its leaders demand a special status for Corsica in the constitution and greater autonomy, as well as equal status for the French and Corsican languages and amnesty for Corsicans jailed for pro-independence violence.
Macron has said he is open to some changes but has ruled out recognizing Corsican alongside French, and on Tuesday reiterated his refusal to pardon Corsican militants.
""Corsica, a proud and dignified land, was dirtied by this crime,"" Macron, on his first visit to the island, said in reference to the 1998 shooting of Erignac.
""Justice was delivered and will be followed, without complacency, without forgetting, without amnesty.""
BALACLAVAS TO POLITICS
Unlike Spain and Germany, France has been reluctant to devolve much power to its regions, despite some decentralization in the 1980s.
Corsica's nationalists are themselves divided over whether their ambition should be enhanced autonomy or independence.
Corsica's tiny 8.6-billion-euro economy is propped up by central government financing and local tax breaks, and lacks the clout of Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of the Spanish economy, or Scotland, which enjoys substantial devolved authority while remaining within the United Kingdom.
Some parallels might be drawn with Wales where a devolution of powers from London in the late 1990s led to more autonomy over housing, education and health, as well as a recovery in the number of people learning and speaking Welsh. Support for outright independence, however, remains low. 
Within the Pe a Corsica alliance, the moderately autonomist Femu a Corsica party holds power in numbers over the committed Separatist Corsica Libera party. Even so, Femu politician Gilles Simeoni, who heads the regional executive, last week told Reuters that Macron risked violence if he did not take talks seriously. 

""In the 1980s and 1990s, when the nationalist movement only represented a minority and was violent, governments of the left and right held talks with men in balaclavas,"" he said in the interview. ""But today, when we represent a majority and say there is no other path than democracy, the government does not want to budge on anything.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged Catholics on Tuesday to reflect on the causes of violence against migrants during the approaching season of Lent, in an appeal days after a shooting attack on Africans further inflamed Italy's election campaign.
In his message for Lent, during which the faithful are called on to fast from food, make sacrifices, reflect and carry out extra acts of charity, Francis warned against allowing ""that charity turns cold within us"".
He said such an attitude can lead to ""violence against anyone we think is a threat to our own certainties: the unborn child, the elderly and infirm, the migrant, the alien among us ...""
Italy was shaken on Saturday when a neo-Nazi shot and injured six African migrants while driving around the central city of Macerata in a racially motivated attack a month before the March 4 national elections. 
The attack, which the pope did not mention specifically, aggravated tensions in a campaign in which Italy's center-right parties have called for the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants.
The pope's words were applicable to a number of other European countries where anti-immigrant sentiment is running high, including Germany, where the far right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party entered parliament last year.
Francis, who has made the defense of migrants a major plank of his papacy, also drew a link between their fate and two of his other main concerns - the environment and disarmament.
""The earth is poisoned by refuse, discarded out of carelessness or for self-interest. The seas, themselves polluted, engulf the remains of countless shipwrecked victims of forced migration,"" he said.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimated that 2,832 migrants died last year trying to reach Italy from North Africa, down from 4,581 in 2016. Some 119,310 people made it alive to Italy in 2017, against 181,436 the year before.
Francis has made many appeals for disarmament and as the war of words between the United States and North Korea has heated up, he called for a legally binding ban on nuclear weapons.

This year, Lent starts on Ash Wednesday, Feb. 14 and runs to Easter, April 1.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish soldier was killed in a rocket and mortar attack in northwest Syria as Turkish forces were setting up a military post in the largest remaining stronghold of opposition to President Bashar al-Assad, Turkey's military said on Tuesday.
It was the second attack in a week on Turkish soldiers trying to establish a position near the front line between rebels and pro-Syrian government forces, under a deal with Russia and Iran meant to reduce fighting in the area. 
That deal largely collapsed in December when the Syrian army along with Iran-backed militias and heavy Russian air power launched a major offensive to take territory in Idlib province and surrounding areas. 
Turkey said five soldiers were also wounded in Monday night's attack. A civilian member of the Turkish contingent was also wounded, according to the military.
The army began setting up the outpost on Monday southwest of Aleppo city, the deepest position Turkey has established so far inside northwestern Syria under the agreement with Moscow and Tehran aimed at ""de-escalating"" the violence.
Turkey, which supported rebels trying to overthrow Assad, has worked with Assad's main international backers Russia and Iran in recent months to try to stem some of the bloodshed in Syria's nearly seven-year-old civil war.
But all three countries remain deeply involved in the conflict, and stark divisions remain.
Iran urged Turkey on Monday to halt its two-week-old military offensive against the Kurdish YPG militia in northern Syria's Afrin region, which is adjacent to Idlib. 
""Turkey's actions can bring back insecurity, instability and terrorism to Syria,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.
In Idlib, Russia has intensified air raids on rebel-held towns after jihadist fighters shot down a Russian warplane and killed its pilot. Iran-backed Shi'ite militias also helped the Syrian army advance in the region last week.
On Tuesday, the United Nations called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire of at least one month as heavy air strikes were reported to have killed at least 30 people in rebel-held areas near Damascus and in the northwest.
In an apparent warning to Turkey, a commander in the military alliance backing Assad said the Syrian army had deployed air defenses and anti-aircraft missiles to front lines with rebels in the Aleppo and Idlib areas close to Turkey.
""They cover the air space of the Syrian north,"" the commander told Reuters. That would include the Afrin area where Turkish warplanes have been supporting a ground offensive by the Turkish army and Free Syrian Army rebel factions.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the military operations in Afrin and Idlib would continue, and repeated Turkey's demand for U.S. forces to pull back from the town of Manbij where they are stationed alongside Kurdish-led forces.
""We will come to Manbij to deliver the land to its true owners,"" Erdogan told a session of parliament, referring to Arab occupants of Manbij who say they were driven out of the town by the Kurdish YPG-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
Erdogan said the United States was setting itself up against Turkey, Iran and possibly Russia by arming the SDF in a large part of northern Syria which borders Turkey. Washington says it wants to continue the fight against Islamic State and to create a bulwark against Iranian influence in Syria and Iraq. 
Turkey says the YPG fighters Washington is supporting are part of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency in southern Turkey for three decades.
""If the United States says they are sending 5,000 trucks and 2,000 cargo planes of weapons for the fight against Daesh (Islamic State), we don't believe this,"" he said. ""It means you have calculations against Turkey and Iran, and maybe Russia.""
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said the observation post being established by Turkey was near the village of al-Eis, which would place it less than five km (three miles) from territory held by Syrian government forces and their allies.
A week ago, a large Turkish military convoy heading for the same area withdrew after it was hit by a car bomb which killed one person.

Six Southeast Asian nations launched an intelligence pact last month aimed at combating Islamist militants and improving co-operation on security threats, overcoming what analysts described as a high level of distrust. They also pledged to increase cooperation in July.
""We, the Defence Ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), note with grave concern the rise of terrorism in our region, perpetrated by individuals and groups with increasingly sophisticated and deadly tactics and weapons,"" they said at the conclusion of their two-day meeting in Singapore.
""The scale and complexity of the terrorist threat faced by our region continues to grow with the influx of returning foreign terrorist fighters and cross border movement of terrorists."" 
The ministers said they would also improve cooperation with external partners. 
The push for further regional cooperation comes after insurgents aligned to Islamic State laid siege to the southern Philippine city of Marawi last year.
That battle sparked alarm that as Islamic State suffered reversals in Iraq and Syria, it was seeking to create a stronghold in Southeast Asia, buttressed by fighters returning from the Middle East.
ASEAN consists of Indonesia, which has the world's biggest Muslim population, and mostly Muslim Malaysia alongside Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
Singapore, ranked one of the safest countries in the world, has also been stepping up efforts to deter terrorism in recent years.

May, Britain's second female prime minister, will also use the anniversary to press for an end to online abuse that is ""coarsening"" political debate.
In a speech in the northern English city of Manchester, the birthplace and home of the British suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst, May will announce government measures intended to make sure social media firms are stamping out offensive content.
But before the speech, May turned to how she finds her role as prime minister and the growing criticism from both inside and outside her Conservatives that she is not up to the job.
""My approach is much I would say about trying to work with the team ... I think it's about ensuring you have different opinions being heard around the table but bringing those opinions together in a way that achieves an outcome that is good,"" she told BBC radio.
Asked what she would say to her critics, some of whom have called for her to step down, she said: ""I put a much greater focus on not what you say but on what you do, and I guess that is another difference perhaps between women sometimes and men.""
May enjoyed a honeymoon in the opinion polls when she took power after Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016. But since losing her Conservatives' majority in parliament in an ill-judged election in June, her leadership has been questioned.
Critics say her cautious approach has increasingly left her hostage to the deep divisions among her ministers, especially over Brexit, with some concerned the EU has now gained the upper hand in talks. On Monday, the EU said it was time for Britain to make a choice on their future ties.
But May will also use the centenary of the women's vote to return to a favored refrain and renew her call for a fight against online abuse, which she says often targets women lawmakers more than men.
Her measures will sit alongside a commitment from the minister for women and equalities, Amber Rudd, to offer 2.5 million pounds ($3.5 million) for schemes to increase women's participation in political and public life.
""As we remember the heroic campaigners of the past, who fought to include the voices of all citizens in our public debate, we should consider what values and principles guide our conduct of that debate today,"" she will say in Manchester.

MALE/COLOMBO (Reuters) - An exiled former president of the Maldives urged India on Tuesday to send an envoy backed by military to release political prisoners after the government of the Indian Ocean archipelago imposed a state of emergency and arrested two senior judges.
Best known as an ""A-list"" holiday destination, the Maldives plunged into crisis last week after the Supreme Court quashed terrorism convictions against nine leading opposition figures including the country's exiled, first democratically elected president, Mohamed Nasheed. 
Having defied the court ruling to release the detainees, President Abdulla Yameen declared an emergency and ordered security forces to seize control of the court and arrest the chief justice and another judge. 
Nasheed, who was granted asylum by Britain after the government allowed him to leave jail for medical treatment abroad in 2016, sought Indian intervention to resolve the island nation's most serious political crisis in years. 
""On behalf of Maldivian people we humbly request: India to send envoy, backed by its military, to release judges & pol. detainees... We request a physical presence,"" Nasheed, who is currently in Colombo, said in a Twitter post.
He also urged the United States to block financial transactions of Yameen's government.
Since Yameen took control of the overwhelmingly Muslim country of 400,000 people in 2013, his government has faced heavy criticism over the detention of opponents, political influence over the judiciary and the lack of freedom of speech.
Addressing the nation on state television, Yameen said he had acted to prevent a coup, and suggested that the judges had chosen to side with his opponents because they were being investigated for corruption.
""I declared the state of emergency because there was no way to hold these justices accountable. This is a coup. I wanted to know how well planned this coup,"" he said.
As part of the crackdown, police also detained Yameen's half-brother, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who had ruled the Maldives for 30 years until 2008 and now stands with the opposition.
Gayoom was detained at his residence along with his son-in-law. But Gayoom's son Faris, who was one of the imprisoned opposition leaders that the court ordered to be freed, was released on Tuesday, his lawyer told Reuters. 
Other opponents of Yameen remained in prison.
RIVAL INFLUENCES 
Located near key shipping lanes, the Maldives have assumed greater importance after China began building political and economic ties as part of its so-called 'String Of Pearls' strategy to build a network of ports in the Indian Ocean region. 
Having historically held more clout in the islands, India has sought to push back against China's growing influence there.
India, the United States and Britain have urged Yameen to honor the rule of law and free the detainees.
""President Yameen has systematically alienated his coalition, jailed or exiled every major opposition political figure, deprived elected members of parliament of their right to represent their voters in the legislature, revised laws to erode human rights ... and weakened the institutions of government,"" the U.S. State Department said in a statement.
Indian intervention in the Maldives would not be unprecedented, as New Delhi sent troops in 1988 to foil a coup, purportedly involving foreign mercenaries. 
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said it was an internal matter for the Maldives.
""We believe that the Maldives government, political parties and people have the wisdom and ability to cope with the present situation themselves,"" Geng told a daily news briefing.
China has had good ties with Yameen’s government and a free trade agreement between the two countries was signed in December, despite criticism from the opposition.
Any Indian involvement would risk raising tensions further in the overwhelmingly Muslim archipelago of 400,000 people and intensify the rivalry with China. 
Aside from the intervention in 1988, India has generally tried to avoid meddling in the Maldives' internal affairs, although it has continued to provide military and economic assistance. 
TOURIST PARADISE
The tumult comes during the peak tourism season in Maldives, which earned $2.7 billion in 2016 from holidaymakers visiting luxury hotels and dive resorts scattered round the myriad tiny islands and coral atolls.
China, the United States and India have already issued advisories against traveling to the tropical islands, though most tourists would only pass through rather than stay in Male, the densely populated capital where the political tensions are highest. 
""It has affected business. We have advised our operators to not sell Maldives packages,"" said Raman Singh Taneja, Managing Director, Flexi Tours Pvt Ltd in New Delhi that sends tour packages. ""It's like a coup there, worse than earlier.""

EDINBURGH (Reuters) - A Scottish court rejected on Tuesday a legal attempt to ask the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to clarify whether Britain could unilaterally stop the Brexit process.
The case was brought by a group of anti-Brexit lawmakers in an attempt to show that Britain's decision to leave the European Union could be reversed if London withdrew its notification of Article 50 - the process by which Brexit was formally initiated.
But judge J. Raymond Doherty of Scotland's top civil court declined to refer the matter to the ECJ.
""I am not satisfied that the application has a real prospect of success. Permission to proceed is refused,"" he said.
A lawyer for the group who brought the case said they would appeal against the ruling.
At stake is an attempt to clarify whether Britain theoretically has the option of unilaterally withdrawing its Article 50 notification, regardless of whether the 27 other EU members authorize it to do so.
To date, there are no plans to stop Brexit and opinion polls have shown no clear sign of a change of heart. In 2016, Britain voted to leave the EU by 52 to 48 percent. 
But a recent poll showed most Britons would support a vote on whether or not to leave once the terms of departure are known. And British lawmakers defied the government in December by giving parliament a much more substantial say on whether to accept the final Brexit deal.
Prime Minister Theresa May's government is divided on exactly what the terms of Brexit should be but is clear that Britain will be leaving the European Union in March next year.
Anti-Brexit campaigners have been arguing that once the negotiated terms of Brexit are known, lawmakers should be given the option to vote on the deal. In that case, one of the options should be to reverse Brexit and stay in the EU, they say.
""LEGAL ROUTE TO REVOCABILITY""
Jo Maugham, a lawyer funding the Scottish legal case, said the case was plainly in the national interest.
""I will support an appeal against this decision - to the Supreme Court if necessary,"" he said.
He argues that while there is no doubt that Britain could stop Brexit with the permission of the other 27 members, it should seek to establish a legal right to do so unilaterally whether the rest of the bloc likes it or not.
""To improve the bargaining position of the UK, to ensure we retain the opt-outs and rebates that we presently enjoy, and to place the decision entirely in the hands of the UK's Parliament and – if it chooses – its people, we must seek to establish a legal route to revocability,"" he wrote in an explanatory blog.
Tuesday's decision can be appealed in Scotland and then, if permission is granted, to the UK Supreme Court in London. From there it could be referred to the ECJ, which rules on the meaning of EU law.

The lawmakers behind the challenge represent electoral areas in Scotland which voted strongly to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, against the grain of the United Kingdom which as a whole voted to leave.

The dispute has become increasingly bitter, with both sides trading accusations after two Chinese airlines canceled extra flights to self-ruled Taiwan over the Lunar New Year, the most important holiday in the Chinese calendar, potentially leaving thousands of Taiwanese without tickets to go home.
In January, China, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province, opened several new air routes, including a northbound route up the sensitive Taiwan Strait that divides China from the island.
Taiwan says it was done without its agreement, contravening what the democratic government in Taipei has said was a 2015 deal to first discuss such flight paths.
The Lunar New Year begins on Feb. 16.
Seeking to alleviate worries about stranded holidaymakers, Taiwan's China policy-making Mainland Affairs Council said there were already 418 extra flights added for the holidays in addition to 586 regularly scheduled flights, serving 50 Chinese destinations.
""At present there are still seats on other airlines' regular and additional services,"" the council said.
Taiwan says the new routes could affect flight safety as they pass close to two groups of Taiwan-controlled islands close to China which have regular flights to and from Taiwan.
The council said it sympathized with people being inconvenienced on their return home. 
""But safety comes before all else, and the government doesn't have the space to compromise,"" it said.
China denies any safety threat, and says the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has told them the M503 route - the main point of contention - has been assessed and approved by them.
In a statement sent to Reuters, ICAO said the route had been approved in 2015 by an amendment to an air navigation plan for the Asia-Pacific region.

""These amendments are undertaken through a formal process that includes a consultation with the user and provider states concerned, as well as relevant international organizations,"" it said.

The Bell 412EPI helicopters will be delivered early next year as President Rodrigo Duterte re-focuses the armed forces modernization program to tackle growing domestic threats as Maoist fighters and pro-Islamic State extremists try to regroup.
""The helicopters will be used for the military's internal security operations,"" Major-General Restituto Padilla, military chief of plans, told Reuters, adding the aircraft could also be used for search-and-rescue and disaster relief operations.
The helicopters would replace the second-hand Vietnam War-era UH-1H Huey rotary aircraft, the workhorse of the Philippine Air Force. The Philippines acquired those from the United States.
Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana signed the negotiated government contract with the Canadian Commercial Corporation, which was licensed to sell the American military aircraft. 
It was the second time the Philippines has acquired Bell helicopters. In 2014, it bought eight lower variant of the aircraft for 4.8 billion pesos.
The Philippines is spending 125 billion pesos for the next five years to modernize its armed forces, but putting priority on equipment and armaments for internal security operations to defeat domestic threats as well protect its maritime borders.

""We discussed the matters relating to the South China Sea and took note of the concerns expressed by some ministers on the land reclamations and activities in the area, which have eroded trust and confidence, increased tensions and may undermine peace, security and stability in the region,"" Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said.
Singapore has taken over the role of chairing ASEAN for 2018, and this week hosts meetings of the group's foreign and defense ministers. 
China and ASEAN in August adopted a negotiating framework for a Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sean in August.
Both sides hailed the move as a sign of progress, with China welcoming the talks as an opportunity to bolster mutual understanding and trust. Critics, however, suspect Beijing of buying time to consolidate its maritime power.
Malaysia, Taiwan, Brunei, Vietnam and the Philippines claim some or all of the South China Sea, one of the world's busiest sea routes. China claims most of the waterway and has been aggressively building and militarizing artificial islands.
Balakrishnan said resolution of the South China Sea dispute would not be easy, even with the talks for a code of conduct under way. 
""It's going to be a very complicated negotiation,"" he told a news conference. ""Territorial claims are not resolved just because you have a COC,"" he said.

27,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 05:46AM ET</span>","Hong Kong court frees three democracy leaders, but warns against future acts of dissent","By Venus Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's highest court freed three young leaders of the city's pro-democracy movement on Tuesday, including the public face of the protests, Joshua Wong, in a stark reversal of an earlier ruling, but it warned against future acts of dissent. 
The unanimous decision was made by a panel of five judges on the Chinese-ruled city's Court of Final Appeal, led by Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma. Wong, 21, Nathan Law and Alex Chow had served roughly two months in jail before they were granted bail in November.
Before that, a magistrate's court had ruled the activists should serve community service and a suspended sentence for a charge of ""unlawful assembly"" after they and others stormed into a fenced-off area in front of government headquarters in September 2014.
That sparked a night-long standoff with police and was seen as a key trigger for the “Umbrella Movement” that blocked major roads in the city for 79 days in a push for full democracy, presenting Communist Party rulers in Beijing with one of their biggest political challenges in decades.
But this non-jail sentence was challenged by Hong Kong's Department of Justice that pushed for a review, eventually leading the Court of Appeal to impose jail terms.
The five judges, including a non-permanent foreign judge, Lord Leonard Hoffmann, said in the judgment that they had ""quashed the sentences of imprisonment"" by the Court of Appeal.
They stressed, however, that Hong Kong was a law-abiding society and that ""future offenders involved in large-scale unlawful assemblies involving violence"" will be subject to stricter guidelines laid down by the Court of Appeal.
Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with a guarantee of wide-ranging freedoms, including an independent judiciary and freedom of speech, but critics accuse Beijing of creeping interference in the city's affairs and the government of toeing the Beijing line.
The three activists were somber despite being freed, saying future activists could be unjustly punished for civil disobedience, even acts aimed at defending local rights and freedoms.
""It's not a time for celebration ... It's a long term battle for us in the future,"" said Joshua Wong.
""Maybe more and more activists will be locked up because of this harsh judgment ... We must urge people to continue to fight for democracy.""
The judges said: ""There is no constitutional justification for violent unlawful behavior. In such a case involving violence, a deterrent sentence may be called for and will not be objectionable on the ground that it creates a 'chilling effect' on the exercise of a constitutional right.""
Amnesty International's Hong Kong director, Mabel Au, said in a statement that the court had: ""corrected an injustice"" but added that ""all politically motivated prosecutions aimed at silencing those promoting democracy in Hong Kong must be dropped"".
Besides the trio of Wong, Law and Chow, dozens of other mostly young democracy activists have also been jailed, or are facing court proceedings that could see them incarcerated for various forms of rights activism, in what some see as a concerted attempt by authorities to curtail the momentum of the city's youth-led democracy movement.

""This will have some impact on Hong Kong's activism ... the norm is different now and has shifted to heavier sentences,"" said Jonathan Man, a lawyer who has represented some of these rights activists. ""This is setting a precedent.""

28,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 05:29AM ET</span>",Myanmar policeman who arrested Reuters reporters tells court he burned his notes,"By Shoon Naing and Thu Thu Aung
YANGON (Reuters) - A Myanmar police officer who was part of the team that arrested two Reuters journalists in December told a court on Tuesday that he had burned the notes he made at the time, but gave no reason why he had done so.
Police Second Lieutenant Tin Htwe Oo was the latest prosecution witness to give evidence at the Insein district court in Yangon, which will decide whether reporters Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, should be charged under Myanmar's colonial-era Official Secrets Act.
Tin Htwe Oo read from a notebook to recount details of the arrest, which he said was based on notes written at the time. Under cross-examination by the defense, he said he had burned his original notes, but had not been instructed to do so.
""Only the police will know the reason for that,"" defense lawyer Than Zaw Aung told reporters after the hearing.
Dozens of reporters and diplomats were present when the Reuters journalists were brought in handcuffs from prison to the crowded courtroom.
They had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in Rakhine state, where an army crackdown on insurgents since the end of August has triggered the flight of 688,000 Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh, according to the United Nations.
GRAPHIC - Arrested Reuters Reporters - http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/MYANMAR-JOURNALIST-PROFILE/0100602S055/index.html
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were detained on Dec. 12 after they had been invited to meet police officers over dinner in Yangon. They have told relatives they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some documents at a restaurant by two officers they had not met before.
Tin Htwe Oo made no reference to the restaurant meeting, saying police stopped the two reporters as they walked along a road. He said after stopping them, police discovered secret documents relating to the Rakhine conflict.
The arresting officers made an inventory of around 20 items in their possession – including their cell phone numbers and details of ATM and library cards – on the spot within 10-15 minutes, he said.
Defense lawyer Than Zaw Aung said he had asked Tin Htwe Oo repeatedly in cross-examination how they had been able to do this so quickly, but said he did not give a clear response.
""They were saying that it only took 10 to 15 minutes but items found from the reporters were phones and cards and it will take around 30 minutes to record those,"" Than Zaw Aung said. 
CALLS FOR RELEASE
At the last court hearing on Thursday, another prosecution witness, Police Major Min Thant, agreed during cross-examination by the defense that the information in documents that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were holding in their hands at the time of their arrest had already been published in newspaper reports.
""Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are journalists who perform a crucial role in shedding light on issues of global interest,"" Reuters said in a statement after the proceedings ended for the day.
""We believe that the ongoing court proceedings will demonstrate their innocence and they will be able to return to their jobs reporting on events in Myanmar. We are grateful for the expressions of support for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo and continue to call for their prompt release.""
The two reporters, whose application for bail was declined at the last hearing, have now been in detention for eight weeks, first in police custody and then in Yangon's notorious Insein prison.
""We feel there's no justice,"" Wa Lone shouted as he and Kyaw Soe Oo were led to a police truck after the hearing. ""The testimonies from the police officers are far from the truth.""
Spokesmen for the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Yangon police chief were not immediately available for comment. In the past they have declined to comment on a case that is before the courts.
The Official Secrets Act dates back to 1923 - when Myanmar, then known as Burma, was under British rule - and carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
The two journalists have been accused under Section 3.1 (c) of the act, which covers entering prohibited places, and taking images or obtaining secret official documents that ""might be or is intended to be, directly or indirectly, useful to an enemy"".
Government officials from some of the world's major nations, including the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have called for the reporters to be freed.

The date of the next hearing was set for Feb. 14.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda is investigating allegations that its officials defrauded donors by inflating refugee numbers and diverting food aid, the prime minister's office said on Tuesday.
The East African country hosts more than 1 million people who fled war in neighboring South Sudan and some 400,000 more from Burundi and Democratic Republic of Congo, a massive aid operation that whistleblowers said had become subject to fraud.
""The government took them (allegations from U.N. agencies) seriously and immediately instituted an investigation,"" Julius Mucunguzi, spokesman for the prime minister's office, which overseas refugee affairs, told Reuters.
The U.N. agencies have demanded from Uganda ""a proper audit on the (refugee) numbers because the process for verification ... has not been robust enough.""
""And related to that is food, so if the numbers are not right, how much food is going to who?"" Mucunguzi said. ""They want a value for money audit.""
As refugee numbers surged since mid-2016, donors responded to urgent appeals for extra aid. 
The European Union, a major donor, said the allegations had been forwarded to its own anti-fraud office for investigation.
""It is indeed of utmost importance to address swiftly and thoroughly any allegations of malfeasance in order not to impair ... public support from the European taxpayers,"" the EU delegation in Uganda said in a statement.
Corruption is widespread in Uganda and successful prosecutions are rare, with courts usually targeting low ranking officials. 

Mucunguzi said although it was too early to say whether the allegations were true: ""It's likely that there may be malice, and people wanting to tarnish a good program.""

Vietnamese activist Hoang Duc Binh, commonly known as Hoang Binh, led several protests against authorities over the handling of a major environmental disaster caused by a steel plant being developed by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Corp in 2016. 
Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness towards social change, including gay, lesbian and transgender rights, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism.
Binh received two seven-year prison sentences for ""abusing democratic freedoms to infringe state interests"" and for ""opposing officials on duty"", while a fellow activist Nguyen Nam Phong received a two-year term, their lawyer Ha Huy Son told Reuters by telephone.
""Binh said he was innocent, while Phong asked for a reduction of the sentence... The trial was conducted without evidence and objectivity; it was imposed,"" Son said. 
The 14-year jail term for Binh, 35, is one of the toughest sentences to have been delivered against an activist in Vietnam.
Another prominent blogger, Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, known as ""Me Nam"" (Mother Mushroom), received a 10-year term last year.
""The sentences have been more and more severe, perhaps because of weaker interventions from the outsiders and foreigners, and also because the power holders think this sentence could have deterrence effect,"" said Son, who has defended many more rights activists.
Last week, Vietnam listed a U.S.-based group still loyal to the now defunct state of South Vietnam as a terrorist organization while the Communist nation jailed four men for flying the South Vietnamese flag last month.
Besides advocating on environmental issues, Binh also participated and called people to join an ""independent union"" in 2015, local news website Baonghean (Nghe An Newspaper) reported, citing authorities' documents on Binh.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has banned all foreign scientific research off the country's Pacific coast and told the navy to chase away unauthorized vessels, despite earlier allowing Chinese oceanographers to operate there.
There was no clear explanation for the about-face by the mercurial Duterte, who has cultivated warm ties with China, ostensibly to attract loans and investments and lessen Manila's dependence on the United States. 
The area of focus is Benham Rise, which the United Nations in 2012 declared part of the Philippines' continental shelf. Manila last year renamed it ""Philippine Rise"".
""Let me be very clear about this: the Philippine Rise is ours and any insinuation that it is open to everybody should end with this declaration,"" Duterte told a cabinet meeting on Monday, according to a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post by his Agriculture Secretary, Emmanuel Pinol.
The area is roughly the size of Greece and believed to be rich in biodiversity and tuna. Scientists from the United States and Japan have surveyed it numerous times.
However, Chinese interest, including some 18 official requests in 17 years, has caused concern among Philippine nationalists mistrustful of its intentions after decades of disputes and perceived encroachments by Beijing in the South China Sea.
Benham Rise is not in the South China Sea and Beijing has made no claim to it. 
According to Pinol, Duterte said the navy should deploy vessels to chase away any fishing or research vessels, and he wants the air force to patrol the area.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque confirmed Duterte's order, which he said was over a ""national security issue"". 
Roque gave no explanation as to why only a few weeks ago Duterte personally endorsed China's research at Benham Rise to be performed jointly with Filipino scientists.
""Our sovereign right is unquestioned,"" Roque told a regular news briefing.
""All licences are deemed cancelled. There are no foreign entities conducting scientific research,"" Roque said, adding that innocent passage would be allowed, in accordance with international law.
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said a Chinese scientific ship, with four Philippine scientists on board, had recently completed a scientific mission to the east of the Philippines, though not around Benham Rise.
""China respects the Philippines' sovereign and jurisdiction rights over the relevant waters,"" Geng told a daily news briefing.
Pinol said the agriculture department had sent two research vessels to monitor ""foreign groups"" and the military would deploy unmanned aerial surveillance vehicles.

He said the president's order stemmed from a statement from a ""low-level diplomat of another country"" who said the area does not belong to any country. He did not elaborate.

SEOUL/MUKHO PORT (Reuters) - A North Korean ferry arrived in South Korea on Tuesday carrying a 140-strong orchestra to perform during the Winter Olympics this week, taking advantage of a rare sanctions exemption from Seoul 16 years after its previous visit. 
The 9,700-tonne ferry, the Mangyongbong 92, was escorted into the eastern South Korean port of Mukho, where throngs of protesters held large photos of the North's leader, Kim Jong Un, with black crosses drawn through them.
The ministry said it had decided to temporarily lift a ban on North Korean ships to ""support a successful hosting of the Olympics"", which begin on Friday. It is also a fresh sign of a thaw in inter-Korean relations after months of tensions over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. 
Seoul banned all North Korean ships entering its ports and cut off most inter-Korean exchanges, including tourism, trade and aid, in 2010 in the wake of a torpedo attack on a South Korean navy warship that killed 46 sailors. North Korea denied involvement.
Dozens of riot police with shields kept order as the ferry berthed. Protesters also waved South Korean and U.S. flags while singing the South Korean national anthem. No unified Korea flags could be spotted in the crowd. 
South and North Korea will march under a unified Korea flag at the opening of the Games while the two Koreas will also field a united women's ice hockey team.

The art troupe from the North is led by star singer Hyun Song Wol and is scheduled to perform at Gangneung, near the Games venue of Pyeongchang, on Thursday and in Seoul on Sunday.
It will use the vessel for transportation and lodging, the Unification Ministry said, while a ministry official said a small welcoming ceremony would be held to greet the visitors. The official asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The Mangyongbong 92 last crossed into South Korean waters when it carried a North Korean cheer squad for the 2002 Asian Games in the port city of Busan.
KARAOKE, ICE CREAM
Named after a mountain peak, the Mangyongbong 92 was given by a group of pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in Japan in 1992 to Kim Il Sung, the North's national founder and grandfather of current leader Kim Jong Un, to celebrate his 80th birthday, according to the Unification Ministry. 
It features dozens of cabins of different classes, including special rooms where Kim Jong Un's father and grandfather stayed, as well as a restaurant, a bar equipped with a karaoke machine, and a shop where guests can buy souvenirs and snacks, such as ice cream, video footage and images from the 2002 show.
It can carry 350 passengers, Seoul officials said. 
The ethnic Koreans who donated the ferry had used it to travel between Japan and North Korea, sending money and other resources back to North.
However, Japan barred the ship from its waters in 2006 in response to a long-range missile test by the North, resulting in a sharp fall in trade, remittances and other exchanges.
The ferry had also been suspected by Japan and others of being used to smuggle parts for Pyongyang's illicit nuclear and missile programs. 
North Korea's state media has rejected the smuggling accusations as a plot to ""justify the hostile policy"" of the United States and its allies. 
""The conservative media and persons claimed that the use of 'Mangyongbong-92' ... during the Olympic period falls foul of the 'independent sanctions' by the U.S. and South Korea,"" the official KCNA news agency said last month, when the two Koreas were holding talks on the North's participation in the Games. 

""This represents the unpleasant and uneasy mind of the U.S. and the South Korean conservative forces displeased with the trend for the improvement of the north-south relations created after entering the new year,"" it said.

""From the medical report that I received yesterday the situation is not looking good. He is critically ill and we should brace for the worst,"" the source said.

A framework accord between the Vatican and China on the appointment of bishops is ready and could be signed in a few months in what would be an historic breakthrough in relations, a senior Vatican source said last week.
But on Monday, Cardinal Joseph Zen, 86, the outspoken former bishop of Hong Kong said the Vatican is selling out China's underground Catholics and ""forcing them into a bird cage,"" raising the ante in his recent criticisms which had already sparked a rebuke from the Vatican.
An even partial resolution of the thorny issue of who gets to appoint bishops could open the way for a resumption of diplomatic relations nearly 70 years after they were cut during the Communist takeover of China, when missionaries were expelled from the country.
Beijing later established the official Catholic Patriotic Association, which does not recognize the Pope, while ""underground"" Catholic communities that remain loyal to the Vatican have been systematically persecuted for decades.
China has so far said little about the talks.
However, the widely read tabloid the Global Times said a deal between Beijing and the Vatican would be ""tremendously beneficial to Catholics"".
""Despite the difficult process, China's vast numbers of non-Catholics have never been strongly against the Vatican. The Chinese public generally respects each Pope,"" it said in an editorial in its Chinese and English-language editions.
""Beijing and the Vatican will establish diplomatic relations sooner or later ... Pope Francis has a positive image with the Chinese public. It is expected he will push China-Vatican ties forward and solve related problems with his wisdom,"" it said.
The newspaper is published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily but, unlike its sister publication, does not speak for the party or the government.
The moves have not been without controversy in the church.
""Our brothers in mainland China are not scared of losing all their fortunes, being thrown into jail or even bleeding. Their greatest pain is from being betrayed by their 'family members,'"" wrote Zen, who vowed to keep speaking out despite the Vatican's rebukes.
He also said the Pope had, during a meeting with him three years ago, agreed that the official Catholic community run by the Chinese Communist Party objectively represents a schism. 
Another source of friction with China is the Vatican's maintenance of official ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing sees as a wayward province to be taken back by force if necessary.
""The Taiwan question isn't Beijing's top concern in handling its relations with the Vatican as the mainland has many tools to pressure Taiwan,"" it said.

The Vatican is Taiwan's sole remaining European diplomatic ally. China has been ramping up the pressure on Taiwan since Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party won presidential elections in 2016.

Activists had planned to hold a news conference at the Maneeya Center in Bangkok - home to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand (FCCT) - to call on the junta to keep its promise of an election this year, but police issued a warning that stopped the event from going ahead. 
The meeting was led by Nuttaa Mahattana, a television reporter and activist, who spoke to Thai and foreign reporters gathered outside the building on Tuesday. 
""The police contacted the management of the FCCT yesterday. They were worried that a press conference here would breach security laws and constitute an illegal assembly,"" Nuttaa told reporters outside the FCCT on Tuesday.
She is among seven activists from the Democracy Restoration Group who have been summoned by police to face charges of defying a ban on public gatherings after organising a protest in downtown Bangkok last month demanding that the junta not postpone a general election that is scheduled for this year.
The police crackdown comes amid growing disgruntlement in the Southeast Asian country ahead of the vote and a scandal involving the deputy prime minister that has led thousands to call for his immediate resignation.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has said an election will be held in November but there is growing uncertainty as to whether the date will be kept.
Anti-junta protests calling for the junta, formally known as the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), to return Thailand to civilian governance have mushroomed in recent weeks. 
The junta took power following a 2014 coup by the military which overthrew a civilian government.

""We will certainly talk about our common history soon,"" Joanna Kopcinska, the spokeswoman, said in a statement sent to Reuters. 
Israel has denounced the Polish Holocaust bill, which passed in parliament last week and is awaiting a decision by President Andrzej Duda over whether to sign it.
The Polish measure would impose prison sentences of up to three years for mentioning the term ""Polish death camps"" and for suggesting ""publicly and against the facts"" that the Polish nation or state was complicit in Nazi Germany's crimes.
Poland's rightwing nationalist government says the bill is necessary to protect the reputation of Poles as victims of Nazi aggression. Israel says the law would ban true statements about the role that some Poles played in Nazi crimes.
The bill has drawn criticism from the United States and condemnation from a number of international organizations as well as Polish minority groups.
Poland, which had Europe's biggest Jewish population when it was invaded by both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union at the start of World War Two, became ground zero for the ""final solution"", Hitler's plan to exterminate the Jews of Europe.
More than three million of Poland's 3.2 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis, accounting for about half of the Jews killed in the Holocaust. Jews from across the continent were sent to be killed at death camps built and operated by Germans in Poland, including Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor.
According to figures from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Nazis also killed at least 1.9 million non-Jewish Polish civilians.
""The death camps in Poland were built and operated by the Germans, and we cannot allow them to evade responsibility for these actions,"" Bennett said.
""However, many Polish people, all over the country, chased, informed or actively took part in the murder of over 200,000 Jews during, and after, the Holocaust. Only a few thousand people, Righteous Among the Nations, risked themselves to save Jews.""
Kopcinska said that Poland would like to talk about ""the huge involvement of the Polish nation in saving Jews during the war, because under the conditions of German occupation, people of Jewish origin could hardly be saved without the help of Poles,""
But she said Poland is also ready to talk about ""the painful cases when people behaved despicably"" and turned their neighbors in to Germans.
""(The bill) does not limit such discussions, but aims to fight against false accusations against Poland for its complicity in the Holocaust.

""All crew members are reported to be safe and well and the cargo remains on board,"" the company said.
The Marine Express tanker was missing in the Gulf of Guinea after contact was lost in Benin on Friday.
The Gulf of Guinea has become an increasing target for pirates who steal cargo and demand ransoms, even as piracy incidents fall worldwide, experts say.
Ships in the area were the target of a series of piracy-related incidents last year, according to a January report by the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), which highlighted the waters off West Africa as an area of growing concern.

Agnes Callamard, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, said her findings did not indicate a state policy that came from above but rather the actions of a few members of the security forces. Callamard was on a two-week tour of El Salvador.
""I have found a pattern of behavior between security personnel that could be considered as extrajudicial killings,"" Callamard told a news conference, without giving further details.
""This is fomented more by weak answers from public institutions,"" she said.
The United Nations asked the Salvadoran government to investigate cases of extrajudicial killings by authorities and try those responsible.
Human rights organizations have denounced extrajudicial killings and abuse of force by operatives from the government of President Salvador Sanchez Ceren.
""We understand as an institution that there could be some police officers that don't do their job well, but the institutional line is that all working police should do things according to the law,"" police spokeswoman Evelyn Marroquin said.

El Salvador had a homicide rate of 60 per 100,000 people in 2017, one of the highest in the world.

China has been ramping up research into all sorts of missiles, from those which can destroy satellites in space to advanced nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles, as part of an ambitious modernization scheme overseen by President Xi Jinping.
The Defence Ministry said in a brief statement the ""ground-based midcourse anti-missile intercept technology"" had been tested on Monday within China's borders.
""The test reached its expected goals,"" the ministry said. ""This test was defensive and not aimed at any country.""
It provided no other details.
While China, along with its ally Russia, have repeatedly expressed opposition to the U.S. deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, it has not stopped Chinese research into such technology.
China and Russia have also held simulated anti-missile drills, most recently last year.
China fears the THAAD system, with its powerful radar, can look deep into Chinese territory and threaten its own security. It also says it will do nothing to help ease tensions with North Korea over Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.
South Korea and the United States say the THAAD deployment is simply to deter North Korean missile attacks.
China has given few details about its own missile programs, aside from occasional brief statements by the Defence Ministry or in state media.
In 2016, the Defence Ministry confirmed it was pressing ahead with anti-missile system tests after pictures appeared on state television.
State media says China has been conducting anti-missile system tests since at least 2010. China says such technology is needed for its own national defense and security.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation to help young ""Dreamer"" immigrants struggled to gain footing in the U.S. Congress on Monday, as lawmakers prepared to hold a Tuesday vote on a short-term government funding measure to avoid a rerun of January's three-day partial shutdown.
Republicans in the House of Representatives were told at a Monday night meeting that the stop-gap measure would extend funding through March 23, along with a year of defense funding and two years of funding for community health centers, lawmakers said.
Congress' failure to reach an immigration deal delayed passage of a temporary spending bill in mid-January, triggering the three-day shutdown. With existing money running out on Thursday, lawmakers were rushing to pass a stop-gap spending bill that would keep agencies open as they continue a months-long effort to give permanent protections to Dreamers, who were brought illegally to the United States when they were children. 
Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier on Monday floated the idea of passing a big increase in defense appropriations through Sept. 30 while negotiations continued on non-defense spending levels - an idea Democrats have opposed.
Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer said that if the House passes a short-term funding measure with long-term defense funding and sends it to the Senate, where it must pick up some Democratic support to pass, it ""would be barreling head-first into a dead-end.""
House Republicans said they knew that if they passed such a bill on Tuesday it could be sent back by the Senate with additional defense funding stripped out.
""If that’s the choice they make then certainly we’ll have to deal with it on Wednesday or Thursday if the bill comes back,"" Republican Representative Mark Meadows, head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters.
Bipartisan momentum for an immigration bill got a boost earlier on Monday when Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator Chris Coons introduced a compromise measure. Similar legislation has already gained some traction in the House of Representatives.
But Republican President Donald Trump appeared to dismiss it immediately, saying any deal should provide funding for his long-promised Mexican border wall. The legislation did win the backing of a Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin, who has been central to the fight for Dreamers.
A broader bill by Durbin and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham was rejected by the White House last month.
Besides protecting Dreamers from deportation, the McCain-Coons plan would boost security on the Mexican border. But it is narrower in scope than a plan Trump put forward last month, which was resisted by hardline Republicans and Democrats.
It does not offer a sweeping overhaul of the immigration system or include funding for the wall, but calls for a way for Dreamers to avoid deportation and earn citizenship, while also bolstering border security.
The legislation would rely on a variety of tools, not just a physical wall, for securing the southern U.S. border.
About 700,000 Dreamers stand to lose temporary protections that have allowed them to work and study in the United States without fear of deportation under Democratic former President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program.
The latest initiative would protect the 700,000, while also allowing hundreds of thousands of additional young immigrants in similar situations to apply for temporary legal status that could lead to U.S. citizenship.
Most came from Mexico and Central American countries. 
BROAD SUPPORT FOR DREAMERS
""The bill ... does address the two most pressing problems we face: protecting DACA recipients and securing the border,"" Coons said in a statement with McCain.
DACA had been set to expire on March 5 after Trump canceled the program last autumn and asked Congress to come up with a legislative solution by that date. A federal court last month blocked the Trump administration from ending the program, and the administration's appeal is pending before the Supreme Court. 
Lawmakers have been struggling to reach a deal on an immigration bill, despite broad public support for helping Dreamers.
The last major legislative push failed in 2013-14 when House Republicans refused to consider a broad, bipartisan measure passed by the Senate.
During a conference call with reporters, Coons said he was alarmed to hear some senators now talking about simply putting off long-term decisions about Dreamers for a year and making some ""modest investments"" in additional border security.
Coons, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that oversees immigration policy along with other panels, also said that despite Trump's insistence on building a wall, border law enforcement officials in a recent briefing for senators did not make such a request.
""It was clear they are not embracing the notion of a single concrete wall from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific"" Ocean, Coons said. Instead, he said administration officials spoke of the need to repair and upgrade existing fencing, build additional barriers and make other improvements.
Trump has said any immigration deal must include billions of dollars to build the border wall. During his campaign, Trump promised Mexico would pay for the wall, something the Mexican government has said it will not do.

""Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal!"" the president said in a tweet on Monday.

51,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 08:39PM ET</span>",House committee votes to release Democrats' Russia memo,"By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives committee voted unanimously on Monday to approve the release of a classified document that Democrats say will rebut a contentious Republican memo alleging FBI bias against President Donald Trump.
The vote will send the 10-page Democratic memo to the White House as soon as Monday night, giving Trump until Friday to decide whether to allow its release.
If he declines, after approving the release of the Republican memo despite strong objections by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it could set up an angry dispute pitting the White House and many of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress against Democrats, law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
A week ago, Republicans, who control a majority on the committee, joined together to block the release of the Democrats' memo and approve the Republican memo, despite unanimous Democratic opposition.
But Republican committee members said on Monday they were comfortable with releasing the Democratic document now that it had been reviewed by House members.
The Republican memo accused senior FBI and Justice Department officials of not revealing that portions of a dossier used in seeking a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant to eavesdrop on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page were partly paid for by Democrats. 
Trump allowed its release to the public last Friday.
Democrats said the Republican memo was intended to undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller's criminal probe into possible collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign, and that Trump might try to use it to justify firing Mueller or Rod Rosenstein, the No. 2 official at Justice, who signed off on at least one warrant application for Page. 
The dispute, an extraordinary breach between the White House and law enforcement, has also deepened partisan rancor over congressional investigations of Russia and the 2016 U.S. election, prompting concern about lawmakers' ability to produce unbiased reports.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Monday showed that nearly three out of four Republicans believed the FBI and Justice Department were trying to undermine Trump, a sharp turn for a party that has historically been a strong backer of law enforcement agencies. 
'DISTORTIONS AND INACCURACIES'
Democrats said their document would help set the record straight.
""We think this will help inform the public of the many distortions and inaccuracies in the majority memo,"" Representative Adam Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, told reporters after the House Intelligence Committee's business meeting.
He also said Democrats wanted to ensure that the White House would not seek to block all or part of the document, and that any redactions were ""fully explained"" by the FBI or Justice Department. The agencies have had the Democratic document for days, he said.
""We also want to make sure that the White House doesn’t redact our memo for political purposes and obviously that’s a deep concern,"" Schiff said.
Representative Devin Nunes, the committee's Republican chairman who commissioned the Republican memo, declined comment.
Representative Mike Conaway, a senior committee Republican, said he wanted the Democratic memo released but did not know how he would respond if Trump sought to block it.
House rules could let Democrats request an unusual closed vote in the full House of Representatives on whether to override the president if Trump opposes the memo's release.
House intelligence is one of three congressional committees looking into the matter, along with Mueller.
Russia denies trying to influence the election.
Trump, who denies collusion between his campaign and Moscow, and has dismissed the Russia probes as a witch hunt, used social media to express his views on the memos.
Trump took to Twitter on Saturday to say the Republican memo vindicated him, and used more tweets on Monday to praise Nunes as a hero and accuse Schiff of leaking ""confidential"" material. Schiff responded by warning Trump against ""tweeting false smears.""

The White House said it was open to releasing the Democratic memo once it goes through a security review.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Warplanes launched heavy attacks on the two last major rebel-held areas in Syria, killing at least 29 people in the Ghouta suburb near the capital and choking people with gas in Idlib in the northwest, rescue workers and a war monitor said on Monday.
President Bashar al-Assad's government has vowed to retake all of Syria from rebels who have lost large swaths of the territory they have held in a war now entering its eighth year.
A years-long siege on the last major rebel-held area near the capital Damascus, the suburb of eastern Ghouta, has tightened in recent months. In the northwest, the government and its militia allies have been trying to advance in mostly rural Idlib, the last province still largely under rebel control.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said warplanes attacking eastern Ghouta near Damascus had struck the towns of Zamalka, Arbaeen, Hazza and Beitu Soua, killing at least 29 people. State media said rebel fighters shelling the government-held capital killed a woman.
International concern has been growing over the fate of eastern Ghouta, where residents say they have been running out of food and medicine.
In the northwest, the other main battlefield in the war between Assad's government and its main rebel opponents, bombing also intensified on Sunday night after rebels shot down a Russian warplane on Saturday.
Rescue workers said at least nine people had suffered breathing problems from chemicals dropped from the air. Aid groups and rescuers said three hospitals had also been struck.
The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), a charity which supports hospitals in Syria, said its doctors in Idlib reported 11 patients ""with symptoms indicative to usage of chlorine"".
Two barrels containing chemical gasses had been dropped from helicopters on Sunday night, Radi Saad, from the chemical weapons team of the White Helmets civil defense group that operates in rebel-held parts of Syria, told Reuters.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the White Helmets and the U.S.-based Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM) said healthcare facilities in northwestern Syria had been hit by air strikes.
""With the majority of hospitals no longer operating in these areas, these latest attacks will deprive tens of thousands of life-saving care,"" the ICRC said on Twitter.
The Syrian government has consistently denied using chlorine or other chemical weapons during Syria's conflict. Rescue workers and medical groups have accused government forces of using chlorine gas against the rebel-held eastern Ghouta at least three times over the last month, most recently on Thursday.
In Washington, the State Department said in a statement that the United States was ""gravely alarmed"" by reports the Syrian government has used chlorine gas in Idlib.
""The use of chemical weapons by all parties in Syria must unequivocally stop,"" it said.
""ABHORRENT ACT""
Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons arsenal in 2013. In the past two years, a joint inquiry by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin and has also several times used chlorine as a weapon. The inquiry also said the Islamic State group has used sulphur mustard.
The United States and Russia clashed at the U.N. Security Council on Monday over the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Washington accused Moscow of shielding Assad from accountability; Moscow accused Washington of slandering Russia.
The German government called on Monday for a thorough investigation into reports Syria had used chemical weapons in both Idlib and eastern Ghouta.
""If it is confirmed that the Syrian government has once again used chemical weapons, that would be an abhorrent act and an egregious violation of the moral and legal obligation to avoid the use of chemical weapons,"" a German foreign ministry official said.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said last week that the Syrian government had repeatedly used chlorine as a weapon, and Washington was also concerned about the potential use of sarin.
The Syrian civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million from their homes. Neighbors and global powers have been drawn into the multi-sided conflict, sponsoring allied groups on the ground.
Turkish forces are in northwest Syria, entering Idlib under a ""de-escalation"" agreement reached with Assad's backers Russia and Iran. They also expanded their operation two weeks ago into the nearby Afrin region to fight against Kurdish militias who hold that territory.
The Turkish army said on Monday its forces had set up a military post southwest of the Syrian city of Aleppo, the deepest position they have established so far inside northwest Syria under their deal with Russia and Iran.
The ""de-escalation"" in violence they were supposed to monitor has collapsed. In December, the Syrian army alongside Iran-backed militias and heavy Russian air power launched a major offensive to take territory in Idlib province.

The Observatory said the new Turkish observation post was near the village of al-Eis. That would place it less than 5 km (3 miles) from territory held by Syrian government forces and their allies, and deeper inside Syria than the three observation posts set up by the Turkish army so far.

55,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 06:09PM ET</span>",Locked track switch blamed in fatal South Carolina Amtrak crash,"(Reuters) - A locked track switch was blamed for the collision of an Amtrak passenger train with a freight train that killed two people and injured more than 100 in South Carolina on Sunday, raising questions about the delayed rollout of a system to prevent such crashes.
The head of the National Transportation Safety Board said a switch on the tracks, which the freight hauler CSX Corp (O:CSX) owns and operates, was padlocked in a position that steered the Amtrak train onto a siding near South Carolina's state capital Columbia, where it crashed into a stationary unoccupied CSX train.
Robert Sumwalt, the chairman of the NTSB, told reporters Monday at a press briefing that track signals were inoperative because they were being upgraded for positive train control or PTC, a system designed to prevent derailments or crashes caused by excessive speed.
Investigators have conducted interviews and retrieved preliminary data from the Amtrak locomotive, which showed the horn was sounded seven seconds before the recording ended, Sumwalt said.
Investigators want to understand why the switch was left in a position that sent the train to an occupied track, triggering Amtrak's fourth fatal crash since early December
""Just because we might find that somebody made a mistake, doesn't mean that's the end of the investigation,"" Sumwalt said.
In November, the NTSB criticized what it termed Amtrak's ""weak safety culture"" after finding that a series of unsafe conditions led to an Amtrak train striking a backhoe working on railroad tracks in Chester, Pennsylvania, in 2016, killing two maintenance workers and injuring 41. Sumwalt declined to draw any conclusions about whether Amtrak's recent incidents pose a ""systemic issue.""
Amtrak President and Chief Executive Richard Anderson told reporters on Sunday that CSX was responsible for the wreck of Train 91 because of the locked switch. A CSX spokeswoman declined to comment Monday.
Two patients remained in critical condition and another two were in ""serious"" condition at Palmetto Health hospitals, a spokeswoman said Monday.
Two of the recent Amtrak crashes involved vehicles driving around gates and being struck by trains, according to Anderson and North Carolina police. One of those crashes occurred last week when a chartered train carrying U.S. Republican lawmakers struck a garbage truck in Virginia.
Anderson said the South Carolina accident would have been prevented by PTC. Investigators say many deadly U.S. train crashes could have been averted if the system was in place.
Last month, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao urged U.S. railroads and transit agencies to take all possible measures to meet deadlines to install PTC.
""It is important to understand the factors that contributed to this tragic accident and how all stakeholders can ensure a safe and reliable rail system going forward,"" the department said in a statement Sunday.
A deadly Amtrak crash in December near Seattle that killed three occurred on a section of track that did not have PTC operating and could have prevented the derailment, the NTSB said. The NTSB also said the Amtrak engineer on that train told investigators he misread a signal shortly before the incident.

In 2008, Congress mandated the implementation of PTC nationwide by the end of 2015, then extended that deadline until the end of 2018.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's foreign minister said on Monday that she and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had agreed to keep working together to fight drug trafficking, days after President Donald Trump had threatened to curb aid to drug hotspots.
""The secretary of state has recognized Peru's efforts to combat narco-trafficking ... We have agreed that we must continue to join forces in this fight,"" Peru's Cayetana Aljovin said in a joint news conference with Tillerson.
Trump said on Friday that unnamed countries were ""pouring drugs"" into the United States, calling to ""stop the aid"" after a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official told him that cocaine was primarily coming from Colombia and Peru, and trafficked through Mexico and Central America.
Tillerson, who has at times contradicted Trump on foreign policy, struck a more conciliatory tone, saying:
""The U.S. is victimized certainly by the flow of narcotics to the U.S., but the countries in which these narcotics are transited, or where organizations are carrying out their activities to move these drugs, they also suffer as well"".
Tillerson said the United States has been in ""clear dialogue"" on drugs with Mexico, the first stop on his tour.
""The U.S. has to acknowledge that we are the market. We are the largest consumer of illicit drugs and so we have to begin to work on that problem,"" he said, adding that Trump had designated $1 billion to solving it. 
He also praised the Peru-United States free trade agreement and said Trump would be wiling to look at the so-called TPP 11 agreement to be signed in March, after the United States pulled out of plans for a 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership. 
""We haven't rejected that (TPP 11) out of hand but we also have very strong trade agreements already in place with many of the countries in this hemisphere and we should use those fully,"" Tillerson said.
Tillerson on Tuesday will head to Colombia, which received some $10 billion in funding from 2000 to 2015 for military and social programs through the so-called Plan Colombia.
He has used the trip to boost pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and over the weekend mentioned the prospect of U.S. oil industry sanctions against the government that Washington calls a dictatorship.
Maduro on Monday said the OPEC nation would find ways to continue selling oil to the world no matter what the United States decided to do, and said Tillerson was ""wasting his time"" in the region.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - President Michel Temer appealed to Congress on Monday to approve his pension reform proposal to bring Brazil's budget deficit under control, but a cabinet minister said his government still lacks some 40 votes to pass the unpopular bill.
Congressional leaders said that the plan to overhaul the costly social security system would never get through if it was not voted on this month before lawmakers begin to focus on the October general election.
""We have made adjustments to the bill to address legitimate concerns and create softer rules of transition. Now the time has come to take a decision,"" Temer said in a message to Congress at the start of the legislative year.
His minister in charge of political affairs, Carlos Marun, however, told reporters the government was 40 votes short of the two-thirds super majority of 308 needed for approval.
Marun said he was confident that the bill would pass this month because there are between 80 and 100 Congressmen who have not yet made up their minds.
The postponement of a vote in December has raised doubts about Temer's ability to rein in a bulging budget deficit that cost Brazil its investment grade credit rating in late 2015.
Economists said Brazil's deficit is unsustainable and mainly driven up by pensions. In GDP terms it has more than doubled between 2014 and 2017. Official figures released last month showed that the social security deficit grew by 18.7% in real terms in 2017, to a record 268.8 billion reais ($82.49 billion).
""The pension vote must be in February. If we delay further, we will never pass it,"" lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia said at a news conference. ""Nobody will be able to govern Brazil next year if spending reforms are not made.""
Lawmakers returned from their recess on Monday to start debating the bill, which the government plans to put to the vote after next week's Carnival (LON:CCL) holiday.

Government whips were negotiating with lawmakers for further concessions to make the bill more palatable to the lower chamber. But they said important provisions such as the introduction of a minimum age of retirement were not on the table.

59,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Lebanon tells Israel its border wall violates sovereignty,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon said a wall Israel intends to build at the border marks a violation of Lebanese sovereignty during a meeting of Lebanese and Israeli military officers chaired by U.N. peacekeepers on Monday.
Disagreement over the wall and Lebanon's plans to explore for offshore oil and gas in disputed maritime waters have elevated tensions between Israel and Lebanon, which is home to the powerful Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah.
The Israeli army has previously said the construction work is being done on sovereign Israeli territory. 
The Lebanese government says the wall passes through territory that belongs to Lebanon but which is located on the Israeli side of the U.N.-designated Blue Line, which demarcated Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000.
The Israeli defense minister, addressing the dispute last week, accused Hezbollah of provocations, saying Israel had withdrawn to the recognized international border with Lebanon and was being challenged over a barrier in Israeli territory. 
The sides met under the supervision of the U.N. peacekeeping force UNIFIL in their regular tripartite meeting at U.N. positions in the Ras al-Naqoura border area.
""The Lebanese side reviewed the matter of the wall which the Israeli enemy intends to build ... confirming the position of the Lebanese government rejecting the construction of this wall as it violates Lebanese sovereignty,"" the Lebanese army said in a statement after Monday's meeting.
Hezbollah and Israel last fought a major conflict in 2006.
In a statement, UNIFIL said the meeting had received great attention ""due to engineering works south of the Blue Line previously announced by the Israeli side"". UNIFIL force commander Major General Beary noted there had been a ""period of relative calm"" since the last tripartite meeting.
""However, there has been a great deal of activity along the Blue Line. I would like to acknowledge the restraint exercised by both parties in decreasing tension and maintaining stability. No one wants to return to a period of escalating tensions and a breach of the cessation of hostilities,"" he said.
OFFSHORE ENERGY DISPUTE
In the meeting, the Lebanese side also rejected recent Israeli comments about Lebanon's offshore energy exploration, the army statement said. 
On Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman described as ""very provocative"" Lebanon's first offshore oil and gas exploration tender and said it would be a mistake for international firms to participate. 
Lebanon has an unresolved maritime border dispute with Israel over a triangular area of sea of around 860 sq km (330 square miles) that extends along the edge of three of five blocks Lebanon put to tender early last year.
Lebanon in December approved a bid by a consortium of France's Total, Italy's Eni and Russia's Novatek for two blocks. One of the awarded blocks, Block 9, borders Israeli waters.
""The block lies entirely within Lebanon's territorial and economic waters,"" the army statement said.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to block a lower court ruling requiring Republican-drawn congressional districts in Pennsylvania to be reworked immediately, boosting Democratic hopes of winning control this year of the U.S. House of Representatives.
Justice Samuel Alito denied an emergency application filed by Republicans to stop the immediate reworking of the electoral district boundaries, preserving a ruling by the state's top court that they had unlawfully sought partisan advantage over the Democrats in drawing the maps.
The Jan. 22 Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling gives Republican legislators until Friday to submit a revised map to Democratic Governor Tom Wolf, who would have until Feb. 15 to sign off on the changes. If those deadlines pass without an agreement, the state court said it would rewrite the map itself.
In a statement, the state's top Republican lawmakers, Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati and House Speaker Mike Turzai, said they still believe the Pennsylvania Supreme Court exceeded its authority.
""We will do our best to comply with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's Jan. 22 order, but may be compelled to pursue further legal action in federal court,"" they said.
A new map potentially could give Democratic candidates a chance to pick up several Republican-held seats in Pennsylvania alone, with national polls showing voters strongly favoring Democrats in 2018 over President Donald Trump's party.
Democrats, who hold only five of Pennsylvania's 18 congressional districts despite its status as a closely divided electoral swing state, must capture at least two dozen seats currently held by Republicans in the Nov. 6 congressional mid-term elections to wrest control of the U.S. House.
The Pennsylvania fight is one of several across the United States focusing on what is known as partisan gerrymandering, the manipulation of the composition of legislative districts to amplify the voting power of one party at the expense of another.
In a 5-2 vote along party lines, the Democratic-controlled Pennsylvania court ruled that Republicans crafted the map to deprive Democratic voters of meaningful ballots, violating the state Constitution's guarantees of equal protection and free speech.
CHAOS PREDICTED
Republicans, including members of the state legislature, potential candidates and voters, asked the Supreme Court to put the ruling on hold, saying redrawing the district lines this month would cause chaos ahead of the November House races.
Experts have held up Pennsylvania as one of the most extreme examples of gerrymandering, pointing to bizarrely shaped districts that have earned nicknames like ""Goofy kicking Donald Duck."" The Republican-controlled legislature created the current map in 2011, after the 2010 U.S. census.
The appeal had been seen as a legal long shot in part because the underlying lawsuit was based on the state Constitution, not the U.S. Constitution.
The legal challenge was brought by the League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania and several Democratic voters.
""This was always a Pennsylvania state court case about Pennsylvania's Constitution, and the U.S. Supreme Court rightly refused the Republican legislative leaders' attempt to manufacture a federal issue,"" said R. Stanton Jones, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. ""Pennsylvania voters will now get to cast their ballots in fair elections this year.""
The U.S. Supreme Court is already weighing whether to set for the first time a legal standard for partisan gerrymandering in two cases out of Wisconsin and Maryland. The court is expected to rule by the end of June in both cases.
In an action that could help Republicans keep control of the House, the high court on Jan. 18 put on hold a Jan. 9 federal court ruling that had ordered Republican-draw congressional districts in North Carolina to be redrawn because of partisan gerrymandering.

62,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Opponents say Berlusconi to blame for Italy's migrant crisis,"By Crispian Balmer
ROME (Reuters) - Opponents of Silvio Berlusconi accused the former prime minister on Monday of being to blame for a surge in migrants to Italy in recent years as campaigning for a national election turned increasingly ugly.
The build up to the March 4 vote was shaken at the weekend when a neo-Nazi shot and injured six African migrants in central Italy, in a racially motivated attack after a Nigerian man was arrested on suspicion of murdering a local teenager.
While denouncing the gunman as ""insane"", Berlusconi, whose center-right coalition is leading in the opinion polls, on Sunday adopted a new, hardline on immigration, saying hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants in Italy were ""a social time bomb ready to explode"".
The 81-year-old billionaire accused them of living off ""their wits and crime"" and said he would initiate mass deportations if he and his rightist allies win power next month.
The ruling center-left Democratic Party (PD) has been lambasted by opponents for not doing more over the past four years to stem the flow of some 625,000 migrants into Italy -- most of whom set sail from Libya, which was plunged into chaos after NATO ousted former strongman Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
""If migrants come to Italy it's because someone went to war with Libya, and the prime minister was Berlusconi,"" said the PD leader Matteo Renzi, adding that migrants got stuck in Italy because of an EU refugee pact that Berlusconi signed in 2003.
The leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement also said Berlusconi was heavily responsible for the migrant crisis.
""When you start losing your memory aged 81, it's worrying for the whole country ,"" said Luigi Di Maio. ""Berlusconi is responsible for the social bomb that is immigration. It is out of control because of him and because of the center-left.""
Opinion polls say Berlusconi and his far-right partners -- the League and the Brothers of Italy -- will win the most votes at the March election, but will probably fall short of an absolute majority.
Saturday's gunman, Luca Traini, stood for the League in a local election last year, but did not receive any votes. Police found a copy of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf at his house and he has a neo-Nazi symbol tattooed above his eyebrow.
Leftist politicians accuse League leader Matteo Salvini of whipping up hostility to migrants with his often fierce rhetoric against the newcomers -- a charge he denies.
Berlusconi has sought to allay fears over the sometimes extremist tones of his allies by promising to be a moderating force should they govern together. However, his comments on Sunday showed he had bought into their tough line on migration.
He doubled down on his message on Monday, urging Italians to signal to the police the whereabouts of illegal migrants and promising mass repatriations by boat and plane.

""In order to find them, everyone can point out their presence and these people will be picked up,"" he told Rai state television.

63,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 04:19PM ET</span>",South Africa's ANC calls top-level meeting on Zuma's future,"By Alexander Winning
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's ruling African National Congress on Monday called a special meeting of its decision-making executive for later in the week as pressure grew on veteran President Jacob Zuma to step down after years of scandal.
Senior officials of the ANC met to discuss the 75-year-old leader's future which is in the balance over long-running corruption allegations and a weakened economy even as prominent allies desert him.
They include Cyril Ramaphosa, the deputy president, who replaced him as ANC leader in December and who is now lobbying behind the scenes for him to step down as head of state too.
When the meeting of senior party officials broke up on Monday, ANC spokeswoman Khusela Diko dodged a question on what discussion there had been of Zuma, in power since 2009, being removed from office.
""There is no item on an ANC agenda which says the recall (removal) of President Zuma,"" she said.
But the ANC said the National Executive Committee (NEC), which handles key party decisions, would meet on Wednesday to discuss preparations for the State of the Nation address on Thursday, among other issues. 
Zuma is scheduled to deliver the speech to parliament on Thursday, though opposition parties and some in the ANC want Zuma to go before that.
The NEC, which has run South Africa since the end of white minority rule in 1994, has the power to force Zuma to quit.
The ANC's top six most powerful officials met Zuma late on Sunday at his official residence in Pretoria but there was no announcement of the outcome. 
Analysts said then that senior party officials had failed to persuade Zuma to quit.
A group of Zuma loyalists marched on Monday on the party's headquarters in downtown Johannesburg, Luthuli House, in support of the president and two senior ANC sources said it was not certain the NEC would vote on Wednesday to remove him as president. 
""It will depend on the balance of arguments in the room. The meeting today was called to arrange the NEC. We will discuss Zuma's recall (removal) but it's not clear whether we will arrive at a decision,"" one of the sources said.
The rand, which has tended to strengthen on signs that Zuma could step down before his second term as president ends next year, was slightly firmer on Monday.
Zuma's tumultuous time in power has been marked by a string of corruption allegations and street protests against his rule though he has managed to survive several no-confidence votes.
Scandals include 783 counts of corruption which he is still fighting over a 30 billion rand (now $2.5 billion) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s when he was deputy president. 
Zuma weathered a no-confidence vote in parliament after an anti-corruption watchdog investigation found he had ""unduly"" benefited from renovations at his home and paid back more than $500,000 after unsuccessfully trying to argue his case in the Constitutional Court.
ZUMA MEETS ZULU KING
Zuma met Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini on Monday at the king's residence in Ulundi in the Kwa-Zulu Natal province, said Prince Thulani Zulu, a spokesman for the Zulu royal household.
The spokesman declined to speculate on whether the king, a key ally of Zuma, who is also a Zulu, would add his voice to those urging the president to step down. It was not clear when the meeting would end.
Zuma's spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga said the meeting with Zwelithini was ""a longstanding courtesy meeting between the President and His Majesty which was initially meant to take place in January but was postponed due to diary challenges on both sides"".
Zwelithini is the influential traditional head of South Africa's biggest ethnic group, with around 10 million first-language Zulu speakers out of a total population of around 55 million, but he holds no role in government.
""Zuma would listen to the Zulu king. Zuma is a traditionalist and has a power base in KwaZulu-Natal province,"" said political analyst Ralph Mathekga.
""The king is a bargainer, he could help Cyril (Ramaphosa) heal KwaZulu-Natal after Zuma goes.""
Zuma has not said in public whether he will step down voluntarily. But he faces a new confidence-vote in parliament against his leadership on Feb. 22 filed by the opposition far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party (EFF).

Iraqi forces backed by a U.S.-led international coalition last year captured all the territory that fell under Islamic State control in 2014 and 2015, including the northern city of Mosul, which served as the militants' de facto capital.
""The American forces have begun reducing their numbers as victory has been achieved over Daesh,"" the spokesman told Reuters, referring to the Islamic State militant group.
""Coordination continues, to maintain (U.S.) assistance to the Iraqi forces in accordance with their requirements.""
The United States is believed to have around 7,000 troops in Iraq, even though the Pentagon has only acknowledged 5,200 troops. The troops have been mostly training and advising Iraqi forces.
In a statement, the coalition said it would ""shift its focus in Iraq from enabling combat operations to sustaining military gains against"" Islamic State militants. 
""The Coalition will tailor our forces in consultation with our Iraqi partners in order to ensure the lasting defeat of Daesh,"" the director of operations for the coalition, Brigadier General Jonathan Braga, said. 
Braga said that even if the composition of the force changes, the coalition would maintain the capabilities and presence to continue to train, advise and equip Iraqi forces to ensure that Islamic State does not re-emerge. 

U.S. officials say that while Islamic State has lost most of the territory it once controlled in Iraq and Syria, there is concern about the remaining fighters returning to insurgency tactics.

Those sanctioned included Brigadier General Muhindo Akili Mundos of the DRC armed forces, and Gedeon Kyungu Mutanga, Guidon Shimiray Mwissa and Lucien Nzabamwita of three rebel factions operating in DRC.
""We are targeting human rights abusers perpetuating the horrific conflict in the eastern DRC who have contributed to the tremendous suffering of the Congolese people,"" said John Smith, a director at the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, which oversees economic and trade sanctions.
""They are responsible for horrendous acts including sexual abuse and forced military recruitment of children into positions requiring them to commit acts of violence, among other atrocities,"" Smith said in a statement.
The U.S. actions come days after the U.N. Security Council blacklisted the four men for ""planning, directing, or committing acts in the DRC that constitute human rights violations or abuses or violations of international humanitarian law.""
Millions of people died in regional conflicts in eastern Congo between 1996-2003 and dozens of militia groups continue to operate there. The country is set to hold elections at end of December that are meant to replace President Joseph Kabila.
But election delays have raised tensions across the country, triggering street protests and encouraging armed rebellion, especially since Kabila refused to step down when his mandate expired at the end of 2016. 
Mundos, who was accused in a confidential 2016 U.N. Security Council report with recruiting, financing and arming elements of a Ugandan Islamist group to kill civilians, is a close ally of Kabila.
He has repeatedly denied any personal responsibility for massacres in eastern Congo while he was in charge of a military operation targeting rebels. 
The U.S. Treasury said Mutanga was a commander of the Mai Mai militia group who was convicted by a Congolese court in 2003 for crimes against humanity involving murder, executions, cannibalism, rape and mutilation. In 2011, he merged his Mai Mai group with the Bakata Katanga, known as Kata Katanga, which has been responsible for recruiting child soldiers.
Mwissa, who is from the NDC-R militia, was also responsible for recruiting child soldiers and imposing illegal taxes in gold-mining areas and using the proceeds to buy weapons in breach of an arms embargo, Treasury said.
Nzabamwita is a military leader from the FDLR rebel group, accused of fomenting violence and instability.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) plan to continue negotiations on Tuesday as they struggle to reach agreement on healthcare and labor reforms - the final hurdles to another ""grand coalition"".
Negotiators from both political blocs agreed that more time was needed to reach a deal, party sources said late on Monday. They said the talks - initially expected to conclude on Sunday - would continue on Tuesday at the party headquarters of Merkel's conservatives in Berlin.
The parties are racing to clinch a deal on renewing the coalition that has governed since 2013 and end months of uncertainty. Both sides expressed confidence a deal remained within grasp.
""It's going to work out,"" the SPD's Andrea Nahles said on arrival for Monday's negotiations at her party headquarters.
Gerd Mueller, senior member of Merkel's Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) allies, also struck an optimistic tone in the evening: ""I do think that this will now happen.""
The Rheinische Post newspaper, citing an internal SPD schedule, reported that Merkel, the leader of her Bavarian allies Horst Seehofer and SPD chief Martin Schulz wanted to present a final coalition agreement on Tuesday.
In a sign of progress, the parties concluded their talks on Europe. Schulz said on Twitter the agreement included ""more investment, an investment budget for the euro zone and an end of forced austerity!""
The parties further agreed to seek fairer corporate taxation in Europe, including for Internet giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (O:AMZN), he said.
Schulz made no specific mention in his message, however, of any plans to advocate for more powers and responsibilities for the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) eurozone bailout fund, as was envisaged in a coalition blueprint agreed on Jan. 12.
Some conservatives fear that rushing ahead with European integration would create too much of a burden for German taxpayers.
The SPD made reform of the European Union a priority in campaigning for last September's federal election, pledging in its manifesto to work for ""a better and fairer Europe"".
The message failed to resonate with voters, however, and the SPD slumped to its worst post-war election result.
Now, the party is trying to extract concessions on domestic policy that could win over skeptics among its 443,000 members, who get the final say on whether to move ahead with another tie-up with the conservatives.
An Insa poll on Monday showed mounting pressure on Schulz, with support for the SPD dropping to just 17 percent, well below its election result of 20.5 percent, the party's worst since Germany became a federal republic in 1949.
""Germany's political landscape (is) evolving rapidly,"" economist Henrik Enderlein said. He noted that Merkel's conservatives lost three percentage points to 30.5 percent in the poll. That means the planned ""grand coalition"", known as ""GroKo"", would no longer even win a majority of votes.
""SPD vote against #GroKo would be suicide by fear of death,"" Enderlein said.
INVESTOR CONCERNS
Merkel's failure to cobble together a new government more than four months after the election has raised concerns among investors and partner countries at a time when Europe is facing multiple challenges - including the need for euro zone reform and Britain's looming departure from the EU. 
Germany could face a new election or an unprecedented minority government if SPD members reject a coalition deal.
The parties agreed on Monday to end misuse of a property tax loophole and strengthen the financial sector after Brexit by making it easier for banks to hire and fire top managers, a negotiation document showed. [L8N1PT09T]
Over the weekend, they inked a deal to invest more than 2 billion euros in social housing by 2021, to spend up to 12 billion euros on expanding broadband and to channel 33 billion euros to municipalities for investments, including in childcare.
The SPD sees advances on labor rules and healthcare as crucial to winning over left-wing members and other sceptics.
Conservatives have thus far rejected a push by the SPD to ban short-term employment contracts imposed by employers without justification. But they have offered to prevent the repeated renewal of such short-term contracts as a compromise.
The two sides are also at odds over the SPD's call to replace Germany's dual public-private healthcare system with a universal insurance system for all.

Monday's talks were expected to focus on improving public healthcare, such as by changing billing rules for doctors, who earn more by treating privately insured patients.

The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), a charity which supports hospitals in Syria, said its doctors in Idlib reported 11 patients ""with symptoms indicative to usage of chlorine"", SAMS advocacy manager Mohamad Katoub said on his Twitter page. 
Radi Saad, from the chemical weapons team of the White Helmets civil defense group that operates in rebel-held parts of Syria, told Reuters three of the nine people who suffered from ""suffocation injuries"" were rescuers responding to the incident.
Two barrels containing chemical gasses had been dropped from helicopters on Sunday night, Saad said.
The Syrian government has consistently denied using chlorine or other chemical weapons during Syria's conflict, now approaching its eighth year.
Air raids intensified on rebel-held towns and cities in northwest Syria's Idlib province on Sunday night, a day after rebels shot down a Russian warplane and killed its pilot.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, with the help of Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, has said he wants to take back control off all of Syria. Syrian government and allied forces have advanced into rebel-held areas of northwest Syria in recent weeks.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a number of cases of suffocation were reported after helicopters targeted the town of Saraqeb on Sunday.
Rescue workers and medical groups have also accused government forces of using chlorine gas against the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta district near the capital Damascus three times over the last month, most recently on Thursday.
Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons arsenal in 2013. In the past two years, a joint inquiry by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin and has also several times used chlorine as a weapon. The inquiry also said the Islamic State group has used sulfur mustard.
The German government called on Monday for a thorough investigation into reports Syria had used chemical weapons in both Idlib and Eastern Ghouta.
""If it is confirmed that the Syrian government has once again used chemical weapons, that would be an abhorrent act and an egregious violation of the moral and legal obligation to avoid the use of chemical weapons,"" an official with the German foreign ministry said.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said last week that the Syrian government had repeatedly used chlorine as a weapon, and Washington was also concerned about the potential use of sarin gas.

Congo has been grappling with a fresh surge of unrest since President Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his mandate in December 2016. His decision emboldened several rebel groups and raised fears that the vast, mineral-rich country is sliding back into civil war.
The latest killings echo the violence of the 1998-2003 war, when thousands of Hema and Lendu killed each other in Ituri, and come after years of relative peace between the two groups.
""The Hema-Lendu conflict has claimed between 30 and 32 lives and left several people injured, thousands of huts burnt down and thousands displaced,"" the governor of Ituri, Jefferson Abdallah Penembaka, told Reuters.
""We are currently raising awareness in both communities so as not to dig up old demons,"" said Penembaka, adding that police and military presence had also been reinforced in the area.
Congolese army spokesman Captain Carlos Kalombo said he received reports that several houses had been burnt and human lives lost. He confirmed that the army had been deployed to the scene to prevent further killings.
The Hema community said in a statement published on Sunday that 23 people died in an attack led by Lendu militia in Djugu territory. The Lendu were not immediately available for comment and the army spokesman and local officials were unable to verify the Hema account. 
Tensions between the Hema and Lendu are longstanding but the region had been relatively peaceful since provincial authorities began touring the area in December to raise awareness of the need for mutual co-existence.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Two Kenyan television channels shut down by the government over their coverage of the political opposition resumed partial broadcasting on Monday, although a third channel remained off the air. 
The unprecedented act of censorship sparked a local and international backlash against the government of President Uhuru Kenyatta, who won an election in October.
It also reinvigorated an opposition that had appeared unsure of its next step after a highly publicized rally last week at which leader Raila Odinga symbolically inaugurated himself as president. 
The NTV, KTN News and Citizen TV channels were taken off the air on Tuesday, hours before they were due to broadcast Odinga's event. The United States, the United Nations and former colonial ruler Britain strongly criticized the government's censorship. 
The government ignored a court order issued on Thursday to restore the stations, prompting activist Okiya Omtatah to file a case seeking the arrest of officials for contempt of court on Monday. 
Also on Monday, police teargassed demonstrators demanding the stations reopen as they tried to march on government offices. 
It was unclear why the government switched back on the transmitters. A spokesman for the government was not available for comment. 
""There's been no form of communication from the government,"" said Larry Madowo of NTV, which resumed broadcasting on pay-to-view channels although its free-to-air channel, which uses different transmitters, was still off. KTN News was back on its free-to-air channel. 
Madowo noted the transmitters for Citizen TV were in a different place, which might explain the delay. 
POLITICAL PROBLEMS
Odinga's symbolic inauguration in the heart of the capital of East Africa's wealthiest economy was intended as a direct challenge to Kenyatta. Odinga insists he, not Kenyatta, was the true winner of a disputed presidential election last August.
The Supreme Court later nullified the August election on procedural grounds and Kenyatta won a repeat poll in October after Odinga boycotted it, claiming it would not be fair. 
Since the symbolic inauguration, Odinga and his supporters have repeatedly promised to outline their next step, only to postpone the unveiling of their plan. 
Most of their statements have focused on the brief detention of three opposition politicians who took part in Odinga's ceremony, which occurred peacefully after the government withdrew police from the site. 
Around 100 people were killed during the protracted election season, most of them Odinga supporters shot by the police. 

Odinga supporters say they are angered by police impunity, persistent government corruption and the perceived neglect of large swathes of the country by the central government.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel has started handing out notices to 20,000 male African migrants giving them two months to leave the country or risk being thrown in jail.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is offering the migrants, most of whom are from Sudan and Eritrea, $3,500 and a plane ticket to what it says is a safe destination in another country in sub-Saharan Africa.
The fate of some 37,000 Africans in Israel is posing a moral dilemma for a state founded as haven for Jews from persecution and a national home. The right-wing government is under pressure from its nationalist voter base to expel the migrants, while others are calling for them to be taken in.
The government says the migrants are ""infiltrators"" looking for work rather than asylum, but there is a growing liberal backlash against the plan, including from rabbis, a small group of survivors of the Nazi Holocaust and ordinary people who say Israel should show greater compassion to the migrants.
The first eviction notices were handed out on Sunday and job advertisements for immigration inspectors to implement the deportation plan have been posted on government websites.
Rights groups advocating on behalf of the migrants say many fled abuse and war and their expulsion, even to a different country in Africa, would endanger them further.
""I don't know what to do. Rwanda, Uganda are not my countries, what will a third country help me?"" said Eritrean Berihu Ainom, after receiving an eviction notice on Sunday. 
The deportation notices do not name the country migrants will be flown to but Netanyahu has said it will be a safe destination. Rights groups have named Uganda and Rwanda as possible host countries. 
In a poor neighborhood in the south of Tel Aviv that has attracted thousands of African migrants, shops are dotted with signs in Tigrinya and other African languages while abandoned warehouses have been converted into churches.
""I came to Israel to save my life,"" said Eritrean Afoworki Kidane, sitting on a street bench.
He said he would rather go to jail than take the cash and plane ticket on offer to leave the country that has been his home for nine years.
BACKLASH BUILDING
Interior Minister Aryeh Deri said Israel's first obligation was to its own citizens, rather than the migrants. 
""They are not numbers, they are people, they are human and I am full of compassion and mercy,"" Deri told Army Radio. ""But the small state of Israel cannot contain such a vast number of illegal infiltrators.""
But opposition to the plan has been building and some Israelis are now offering to take migrants at risk of expulsion into their homes.
On Thursday, a group of 36 Holocaust survivors sent a letter to Netanyahu asking him not to deport the migrants. The U.S.-based Anti Defamation League has also urged Israel to reconsider the plan, citing ""Jewish values and refugee heritage"". 
Rabbi Israel Meir Lau, chairman of the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and a Holocaust survivor, said in a statement the issue required ""as much compassion, empathy and mercy that can possibly be marshalled. The experiences of the Jewish people over the ages underscore this commitment."" 
Rabbi Susan Silverman has launched a campaign called Miklat Israel (Israel Shelter) for Israelis to take migrants into their homes.
""It's unconscionable for the Jewish state to deport people to harrowing vulnerability,"" she said.
Miklat Israel's Rabbi Tamara Schagas said 600 Israeli families had already signed up and the organization would begin to connect migrants with potential hosts this week.
MORAL COMPASS
The Supreme Court ruled in August that Israeli authorities can hold illegal migrants for up to 60 days in custody.
Immigration officials have said women, children and men with families in Israel were allowed to stay for now, as was anyone with outstanding asylum requests.
Out of 6,800 requests reviewed so far, Israel has granted refugee status to 11 migrants. It has at least 8,000 more requests to process.
Israeli authorities have said Israeli officials will keep in touch with migrants accepted in a third country to oversee their progress. Rwanda has said it will only accept migrants who have left Israel of their own free will.
Nonetheless, the U.N.'s refugee agency has urged Israel to reconsider, saying migrants who have relocated to sub-Saharan Africa in the past few years were unsafe and ended up on the perilous migrant trail to Europe, some suffering abuse, torture and even perishing on the way.
Rights groups in Israel say the government is simply ridding itself of people it should be recognizing as refugees in Israel and that there was no real guarantee for their safety.
A fence Israel has built over the past few years along its border with Egypt has all but stopped African migrants from entering the country illegally. Beginning in the previous decade, when the border was porous, a total of 64,000 Africans made it to Israel though thousands have since left.
Emmanuel Asfaha from Eritrea crossed into Israel in 2011 with his wife and baby son. His second child was born in Israel.
A narrow grocery store stockroom stacked with bags of flour leads to their two-room apartment in Tel Aviv, a poster of Jesus hanging on the cracked walls above his son's bed. Asfaha is concerned Israel will eventually deport families too.
""I am worried about the situation,"" he said while cooking Shiro, a traditional stew. ""Tomorrow it will be for me also.""
A few kilometers away, in a hip, upscale part of Tel Aviv, Ben Yefet, a 39-year-old stockbroker, said he had signed up with Miklat Israel to house two or three migrants in his two-room apartment.

""As Israelis and Jews we are obligated. We have a moral compass, we just have to do it,"" he said.

Karachi, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Chinese man working with a shipping company in Pakistan was shot dead on Monday in what police described as a targeted attack in Karachi, police and hospital officials said. 
While there was no claim of responsibility and the motive was not immediately clear, China in December warned its nationals in Pakistan of plans for imminent attacks on Chinese targets there.
Chinese presence is growing in Pakistan as Beijing has pledged $57 billion for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a flagship ""Belt and Road"" project that first focused on Chinese firms building roads and power stations but is now expanding to include setting up industries.
The man, identified as Chen Zhu, 45, was in his car when he was attacked in an upmarket area of the port city of Karachi. 
At least 10 shots were fired at the car, and Chen suffered a single bullet wound in the head, police said.
""The incident appears to be targeted attack, (it) doesn't looks a mugging,"" Azad Khan, deputy inspector general of Karachi's south zone, told Reuters.
""The victim is associated with Cosco Shipping Lines Co, a Chinese shipping company. We are trying to get further details,"" Khan added. 
Another officer, Javed Akbar Riaz, told Reuters that Chen had an employee ID from Cosco.
The shipping company could not be reached for comment in Karachi on Monday. 
Tens of thousands of Chinese nationals have come to Pakistan, but the new arrivals face dangers, creating a headache for Pakistani security officials.
Islamic State's abduction and killing last June of two Chinese nationals in the southwestern province of Baluchistan highlighted the security risks that have put off many Western companies.
Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, still has a reputation for gang shootings and other violence, despite a paramilitary crackdown that began in 2013 and sharply reduced killings.

Hospital officials said Zhu was admitted in a critical condition, but later died.

Russia has said previous deployments of Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad, a slice of Russia wedged between Poland and Lithuania, were temporary and a response to the United States building up its forces in the Baltic region.
Washington says placing such missile systems near the Baltic states and NATO member Poland is ""destabilizing,"" while U.S. officials have expressed concern that the deployments represent a permanent upgrade to Russia's forces in the area.
Vladimir Shamanov, head of the Russian lower house of parliament's defense committee, said on Monday that Iskander missile systems had been sent to Kaliningrad, but did not say how many or for how long, RIA reported.
""Yes, they have been deployed,"" it quoted him as saying. ""The deployment of foreign military infrastructure automatically falls onto the priority list for targeting.""
The Iskander, a mobile ballistic missile system codenamed SS-26 Stone by NATO, replaced the Soviet Scud missile. Its two guided missiles have a range of up to 500 kilometers (about 300 miles) and can carry either conventional or nuclear warheads

The operation to secure the Hamrin mountain range could start this week, they told Reuters. The area lies between the Kirkuk oil fields and the town of Khanaqin at the Iranian border.
Iraqi oil officials announced in December plans to transport Kirkuk crude by truck to Iran's Kermanshah refinery.
The trucking was to start last week and oil officials declined to give reasons for the delay other than it was technical in nature. 
Six members of a Sunni pro-governmental tribal force were killed on Monday in an attack on the checkpoint they manned on the planned oil route, south of the Hamrin range, security sources said. 
The officials did not elaborate on the possible threats to the Hamrin mountain range. But two groups of insurgents are known to be operating there, one formed by remnants of the ultra-hardline militant Sunni organization Islamic State, while the other known as ""White Banners"", is new and little known.
The White Banners fighters are believed to be drawn from Kurdish populations displaced from the regions of Kirkuk and Tuz Khurmato, in October, when Iraqi government forces and Iranian-backed Shi'ite paramilitary took over the area, according to Hisham al-Hashimi, a security analyst in Baghdad.
""The White Banners have no connection to Daesh nor to the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG),"" referring to the semi-autonomous Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq, he said.
Iraqi military officials acknowledge the existence of a group called White Banners but refused to comment on its composition or leadership. The KRG has ""strictly no relations whatsoever""' with this group, a Kurdish official told Reuters.
Trucking crude oil to Iran was agreed under a swap agreement announced in December by the two countries, to allow a resumption of oil exports from Kirkuk.
Iraq and Iran have agreed to swap up to 60,000 barrels per day of crude produced from Kirkuk for Iranian oil to be delivered to southern Iraq.
Kirkuk crude sales have been halted since Iraqi forces took back control of the fields from the Kurds in October.
Kurdish forces took control of Kirkuk in 2014, when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic State. The Kurdish move prevented the militants from seizing the region's oilfields.

Turkey last month launched an air and ground campaign, dubbed Operation Olive Branch, against the Kurdish YPG militia in Afrin. 
""Turkey should stop its operation and respect Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.
""Turkey’s actions can bring back insecurity, instability and terrorism to Syria,"" he added.
Qasemi said any solution to the Syrian crisis should be discussed in talks in the Kazakh capital Astana that are sponsored by Russia, Iran, and Turkey.
He said Iran was in continuous talks with both Turkey and Russia about the latest developments in Syria.
Russia and Iran back Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey supports Assad's opponents.
Ankara considers the U.S.-backed YPG, which controls Afrin, to be a terrorist group and an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which has fought an insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast since 1984.
The Syrian government last week called the Turkish offensive in Afrin an illegal ""aggression"" and said it would deal with it accordingly.

82,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 09:02AM ET</span>","Lebanon's public sector plagued by inefficiency, waste","By Dahlia Nehme
BEIRUT (Reuters) - The corridors are dark in Lebanon's Public Transport and Railway Administration. A few employees scroll through mobile phones in mostly empty offices lined with filing cabinets covered in dust.
In a country with almost no public transport, these civil servants have little to do. Yet the administration still has a budget of 13 billion Lebanese pounds ($8.64 million). 
Public sector waste is a huge problem for Lebanon, which suffers from one of the highest levels of public debt in the world.
With Lebanon suffering weak economic growth, some leaders are raising the alarm about the unsustainable state deficit, financed mostly by local banks. International donors aiming to meet later this year are expected to demand reform.
But with parliamentary elections approaching in May, Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system will make it hard to deliver cuts. The World Bank said in a 2016 report that the system - long used by politicians to bestow patronage and shore up their support - was partly to blame for waste.    
Public spending in total climbed from $6.5 billion in 2005 to $16 billion in 2016, said Nassib Ghobril, chief economist at Byblos Bank. 
""There is a huge waste, there is overstaffing,"" he said. 
Lebanon's debt-to-GDP ratio was 155 percent at the end of 2017, one of the highest in the world, the World Bank projected. 
Servicing that debt took over the public sector wage bill as the biggest part of state spending late last year, Ghobril said.
Lebanon's transport administration is located in a sprawling complex near central Beirut, dotted with rusting trains from the days when the country had a railway, and roamed by a pack of wild dogs.
""We have massive plans to revive reform and activate the public transport sector,"" its director, Ziad Nasr, told Reuters, including restoring the railway and setting up a proper bus service. The plans are on hold due to lack of funds, he said.
The current public bus service for the country of 4 million people is a fleet of 40 buses. The bus drivers are employed by the transport administration but few get behind the wheel, some because they are afraid they will be attacked by the drivers of private minibuses, who dominate the sector. 
""I haven't driven a bus for more than a year and a half and there are others who haven't driven for 10 years,"" said one of them, asking not to be named.
NO MEANINGFUL ROLE
The transport agency is just one of more than a dozen government departments that are funded but have no meaningful role, said Mohammed Shamseddine, senior researcher at Information International, a Beirut-based consultancy working on market research and public policy.
The Elissar agency was set up to develop Beirut's southwestern suburbs but all work stopped in 1997 due to political disputes and difficulties securing financing. 
Although the development project was shelved, the agency has retained an annual budget of 3.4 billion pounds ($2.25 million) and roughly 40 employees, said Shamseddine. 
The agency declined to talk to Reuters. But its former director Fadi Fawaz, now an economic adviser to Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, said the government plans to relaunch the project this year.
""For 20 years, (it) has seen no progress,"" he admitted.
The power-sharing system, part of an agreement that ended Lebanon's civil war in 1990, can extend informally to balancing civil service staff ratios along sectarian lines, the World Bank's 2016 report said, making it difficult to lay off staff. 
""Each of these administrations has a general director and employees and abolishing it means infringing the rights of the sects to which these civil servants belong,"" said Shamseddine, who has been gathering data on the issue. 
Some agencies close down only after the last employees have retired, he said. He gave the example of an agency set up to promote Lebanon's once famous silk industry that halted all activities in 1975 when the civil war erupted but was only officially closed in 2000.
The postal administration has 60 employees and a 6.8-billion-pound ($4.50 million) annual budget, despite the fact that almost all its functions ceased in 1998 when the postal service was privatized.
It still designs the postage stamps, however.
""There was no strategic vision about what to do with the employees after privatization,"" its director, Mohammed Zuheir Youssef, told Reuters. But he added: ""The state can't cause indignation in society and fire them all.""
SCLEROSIS
A deep split between Lebanon's most important political blocs has caused more sclerosis: elections have been postponed twice, there was no formal government from 2014-2016 and no budget from 2005 until last year. 
A deal between rival parties allowed parliament to appoint the current government in 2016. 
Whether the May elections will help solve problems or simply paper them over is not yet clear. For now it may have made things worse, however.
Politicians with their minds on votes rammed through a popular public sector pay rise in its first state budget in 12 years last year.
They also passed new taxes to cover the extra spending, budgeted at $917 million. But the truth is nobody really knows how much it will cost because there are no accurate data on how many people are on the state payroll. 
A ministry set up at the end of last year to fight corruption and waste lacks a budget, a building, employees, powers or an organizational structure.
""We didn't ask for money. The budget is already heavily burdened,"" said the minister, Nicholas Tueni.

The former president of Georgia entered Ukraine last September despite being stripped of his Ukrainian citizenship in a protracted standoff with the Kiev authorities, whom he accuses of corruption.
He is wanted in Georgia on four charges including abuse of office, which he says are trumped up. The Ukrainian court upheld an earlier ruling to deny him the status of a person in need of additional protection.
""This is yet another decision by (President Petro Poroshenko) and not by the court,"" Saakashvili said in a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after the verdict.
His lawyer, Ruslan Chernolutsky, said the ruling would likely pave the way for Saakashvili's departure from Ukraine.
""We all need to be prepared for the fact that the authorities in an illegal manner will take the decision on his compulsory deportation or possible extradition,"" he said in a video posted by Saakashvili.
In December, Ukrainian General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko said Saakashvili was likely to be extradited.

Saakashvili also faces criminal charges in Ukraine. The authorities accuse him of assisting a criminal organization, which he calls a fabricated allegation to undermine his campaign to unseat Poroshenko.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has ordered its warplanes in Syria to fly higher to avoid being shot down by shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles after one of its jets was downed at the weekend, the Izvestia daily reported on Monday.
Syrian rebels shot the Russian SU-25 plane out of the sky on Saturday in Idlib Province. Russia's defense ministry said the pilot ejected, fought with rebels on the ground, then blew himself up with a grenade when they got close to him. 
Izvestia, citing the ministry, said a decision had been taken that such planes would in future only fly above 5,000 meters (16,400 ft) to keep them safe.
It said that such a policy had previously been in force, but that the SU-25s had for some reason started flying at lower altitudes in recent days.
Shoulder-launched missiles obtained by rebels now posed a threat to all planes operating in Syria, the Kremlin said. But it said it was too early to say who had supplied the weapons system used to shoot down the Russian SU-25.
""It's extremely worrying that shoulder-launched surface-to air missiles are in the hands of the terrorists,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.
""It's a huge danger for all governments.""
Peskov did not signal wider changes in Russia's policy in Syria where Moscow has been supporting President Bashar al-Assad's army for more than two years.
He said that Russia had enough firepower left in Syria to deliver ""crushing blows"" to rebel forces as and when needed.
'HERO OF RUSSIA'
Russia carried out a series of ""pinpoint strikes"" against rebel targets to respond to the shooting down, said Peskov.
Rescuers and opposition activists accused Russian planes of targeting residential areas and a hospital in those strikes.
The Russian Defence Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. It has repeatedly rejected allegations that its planes target civilians, saying they take great care to avoid collateral damage.
The Russian Defence Ministry named the downed pilot as Major Roman Filipov and said he had been posthumously awarded with a Hero of Russia decoration. 
It said he had fought to his last breath after ejecting and parachuting to the ground where rebels had attacked him.
""Major Roman Filipov fought an unequal battle with his service weapon until the last minute of his life,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
""When surrounded by the terrorists and heavily wounded, the Russian officer blew himself up with a grenade when the militants got within several dozen meters of him."" 
Russian media have reported that Syrian and possibly Russian special forces are operating in the area where he was killed to try to retrieve his body, along with fragments of the projectile that struck his plane, to try to work out who supplied it to the rebels.

""The pilot died heroically,"" said Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman. ""We are proud of our heroes.""

Warplanes struck the towns of Zamalka, Arbaeen, Hazza and Beitu Soua, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. 
The Syrian army of President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian air power and Shi'ite Muslim militias, has besieged eastern Ghouta, the largest remaining rebel bastion near Damascus, for years. 
Shelling of the Old City of Damascus, which is held by the government and lies near the rebel enclave that includes eastern Ghouta, killed a woman and injured three other civilians, state news agency SANA reported. 
International concern has been growing over the fate of eastern Ghouta as bombardment by the Syrian military and Russia has increased in recent months and as shortages of food and medicine have led to severe malnutrition. 
Assad and his allies have gained momentum in the seven-year-old war, gaining territory, pushing rebels from most big cities, and forcing several pockets to surrender last year.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Tayyip Erdogan made the first visit by a Turkish president to the Vatican in 59 years on Monday, discussing the status of Jerusalem with Pope Francis, as scuffles broke out between police and demonstrators nearby.
Police, who put much of the center of the city under lockdown for the visit, said two people were detained after demonstrators tried to break through cordons to get closer to the Vatican from an authorized protest several blocks away.
Returning a visit made by the pope to Turkey in 2014, Erdogan spoke privately with Francis for about 50 minutes in the pontiff's frescoed study in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace, which he uses mostly for ceremonial purposes.
A Vatican statement said the talks included ""the status of
Jerusalem, highlighting the need to promote peace and stability in the region (Middle East) through dialogue and negotiation, with respect for human rights and international law.""
Both Erdogan and Pope Francis are opposed to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, which many U.S. allies say could doom Middle East peace efforts..
At the end of the private part of the meeting, the pope gave Erdogan a bronze medallion showing an angel embracing the northern and southern hemispheres while overcoming the opposition of a dragon.
""This is the angel of peace who strangles the demon of war,"" the pope told Erdogan as he gave him the medallion, made by the Italian artist Guido Verol. ""(It is) a symbol of a world based on peace an justice.""
The public part of the meeting, with reporters and Erdogan's entourage, was cordial, although both men seemed stiff at the start while seated at the pope's desk before journalists were ushered out.
Erdogan's motorcade entered a virtually deserted St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) after the streets that are usually bustling with tourists were closed due to security fears.
An authorized demonstration of about 150 people including Kurds and their supporters outside nearby Castel Sant'Angelo, a fortress on the banks of the River Tiber, turned violent when police in riot gear pushed back shouting and shoving protesters who tried to break through their lines. At least one demonstrator was injured, a witness said.
Some 3,500 police and security forces were on duty in Rome and authorities declared a no-go area for unauthorized demonstrations that included the Vatican, Erdogan's hotel and Italian palaces where he is meeting the president and prime minister.
Matteo Salvini, head of Italy's anti-immigrant Northern League, said in a tweet that it was ""shameful"" that the government was receiving Erdogan, calling him ""the head of a bloody, freedom-killing Islamic regime"".
Erdogan and the pope spoke by phone in December after Trump made his announcement on Jerusalem and agreed that any change to the city's status quo should be avoided.
The Vatican backs a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, with both sides agreeing on the status of Jerusalem - home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions - as part of the peace process.
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state, whereas Israel has declared the whole city to be its ""united and eternal"" capital.

Among Erdogan's delegation was the Mehmet Pacaci, Turkey's ambassador to the Vatican. Erdogan recalled Pacaci to Turkey in 2015 when Francis became the first pope to publicly call the 1915 killing of as many as 1.5 million Armenians ""genocide"" - something Turkey has always denied.

87,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 07:54AM ET</span>","Iran could be winner, U.S. a loser from UAE-Qatar tensions","By Noah Browning
DUBAI (Reuters) - A rise in tension between Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in a row over military flights threatens U.S. strategic interests in the Gulf and could benefit regional rival Iran. 
Abu Dhabi says Qatari air force jets intercepted two UAE civilian aircraft on commercial flights to Bahrain last month, and Doha says UAE military aircraft violated its airspace on Dec. 21 and Jan. 3.
Each denies the other's accusations and the two energy-producing states have sought to ease the dispute. The risk of a confrontation between them has increased but a war between them is unlikely, regional experts say.
The increase in tension, seven months after the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt imposed travel and trade sanctions on Qatar over accusations -- denied by Doha -- that it supports terrorism and regional rival Iran, has alarmed Washington. 
""When you have Qatari (military) planes being scrambled near a civilian airliner, it runs the risk of an incident that, even unplanned, could result in the loss of lives and escalate this into an situation Gulf countries have never had among each other,"" said a Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Gabriel Collins, an expert on financial sanctions at Rice University in Texas, said ""military posturing"" against a background of underlying tension because of the diplomatic and trade sanctions ""left space for a miscalculation.""
""A very small spark can, in a worst-case scenario, light a huge fire,"" he said.
U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis has said the fracturing of ties among its Gulf Arab allies hinders Washington's fight against Islamic State and ""countering the spread of Iran's malign influence"".
Iran has criticized the restrictions on Qatar and called for the rift to be resolved through dialogue. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has lamented what he called a ""dialogue deficit"" in the region.
The Gulf is a strategically important area for the United States. The U.S. Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain and the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is a center of its air operations against Islamic State. 
""The United States considers both Qatar and the UAE to be critical regional partners,"" a U.S. Air Forces Central Command spokesman in Qatar said in response to a Reuters request for comment on the incidents. He called for ""meaningful solutions to reduce tensions.""
The base would be crucial if the United States were to go to war with Iran, which Washington says sponsors terrorism and is a threat to stability and U.S. interests in the Middle East. Tehran denies the accusations.
REGIONAL RIVALRY
Predominantly Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia also sees Iran as a threat to regional stability and regards the Islamist Republic, which is majority Shi'ite, as its main rival in the region. 
But more than any of the countries boycotting Qatar, the UAE bristles at alleged Qatari support for Islamists throughout the region and maintains a hard line against the Muslim Brotherhood, branches of which are supported by Doha in some countries. 
There are trade risks for the West as well as security concerns.
""The rivalry between Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies with Iran is raging. These are key trade and security partners to the West for decades and if they are divided and very nearly coming to military blows, in this zero-sum atmosphere, Iran stands to gain and the U.S. to lose,"" another Western diplomat said.
An Arab official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the UAE, because of its competing regional vision with Qatar, wanted to pile pressure on Doha to signal a reconciliation is not close and the boycott will not soon end.
""Saudi Arabia and the other quartet countries have little to fear for their economies from this crisis, though Qatar does,"" the official said.
""Also, because the UAE is so interested in enforcing its demands on Qatar and curtailing its activities in the region, that makes the two countries eager to prove in this phase that they won't be giving up soon and can escalate if necessary.""
U.S. President Donald Trump appears to have softened his view of Doha.
He initially blessed the boycott, accusing Doha of funding terrorism ""at a very high level."" But he offered in September to mediate and this month telephoned Qatar's ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, to thank him for his counter-terrorism efforts.
The change follows a charm offensive by Doha, which in recent months has hosted several right-wing commentators close to the president and matched the UAE's lobbying efforts in Washington.

The change appears to reflect a political calculation among the Gulf states' Western partners that Qatar would not risk allowing the rift with the UAE to deteriorate further, one of the Western diplomats said.

88,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",China says to ban export of more dual-use goods to North Korea,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China released a further list of goods banned for export to North Korea on Monday, saying the items could be used to build weapons of mass destruction, amid a standoff between North Korea and the United States over its weapons programs.
China has released several such lists in recent years as North Korea steps up it nuclear and missile tests. China says it is doing its duty to help enforce the increasingly tough U.N. sanctions.
The latest, extremely technical, list of dual-use goods, or products that have both civilian and military use, comes after a confidential report by independent U.N. monitors that said North Korea violated U.N. sanctions to earn nearly $200 million in 2017 from banned commodity exports.
China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement on its website that the list was meant to comply with the requirements of new U.N. sanctions imposed last year.
The new list names dozens of banned items including air scrubbers for underwater use, equipment to simulate flying conditions for non-civilian aircraft and gas masks not for use by firefighters.
The list was jointly released with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence, the China Atomic Energy Authority and the Customs Bureau.
It is effective immediately, the Commerce Ministry added. 
China remains North Korea's largest trading partner and sole major ally, though overall trade has fallen as the sanctions take effect. 
Chinese analysts have regularly expressed concern that North Korea could collapse in chaos if Beijing's policies become too harsh.
At the same time as saying it is fully committed to enforcing the sanctions, despite lingering doubts in Washington at China's commitment, Beijing has also repeatedly called for a return to dialogue.
The announcement comes as tensions on the Korean peninsula have eased ahead of this month's Winter Olympics in South Korea which start on Friday.

North Korea's ceremonial leader will make an unprecedented visit to South Korea this week, officials said on Monday, as hopes grow for high-level inter-Korean talks during the Games.

Around 1,500 people in Moscow and hundreds more in cities across Russia took to the streets on Jan. 28 in a protest organized by Navalny to support a boycott of presidential elections in March.
Incumbent Vladimir Putin is widely expected to be re-elected, but Navalny says he has been unfairly barred from running over what he says is a trumped-up suspended prison sentence.
Police bundled Navalny off the street in Moscow at the protest and detained him for several hours before releasing him without charge but with talk of a future court appearance.

Navalny said on social media on Monday investigators had delivered two summonses to him, demanding he come in for questioning. He denies assaulting police officers and posted a link to a video of his detention which showed him trying to stay on his feet as several policemen dragged him to a nearby bus.

HALABJA, Iraq (Reuters) - Islamic State may be on the wane in Iraq and Syria but for Iran, the threat is still strong, centered on Kurdish communities along the Iraq-Iran border where militants have operated in recent years.
The locals even have a nickname for the area, ""Tora Bora"", after the mountain hideout al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden fled to after the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001, a senior Iraqi security official in the border region said.
In late January, three Revolutionary Guards were killed in the Bamo region fighting 21 Islamic State militants who had sneaked in from Iraq. Three militants detonated suicide vests and two others were killed in the clash, the Guards said.
Days earlier, Iran’s intelligence ministry found a weapons cache in the town of Marivan on the Iranian side of the border that included TNT, C4, electronic detonators, grenades, ammunition clips for AK-47 machine guns and rocket propelled grenades.
The clash and discovery indicate that Islamic State still has the ability to penetrate the tightly controlled security net of the Islamic Republic, which has largely managed to avoid the devastation wrought by the group in neighboring countries. 
""Today (Islamic State) does not control a country ... in order to assert that they exist, they may carry out an attack any day,"" Hossein Dehghan, a former defense minister and now an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a recent interview with the semi-official Tasnim news agency.
Halabja, the largest town on the Iraqi side, is most often remembered for a chemical attack ordered by then-President Saddam Hussein in 1988 which left thousands dead.
The presence of religious militants in the area around the town is not new: at the city's entrance hang portraits of Iraqi Kurdish security forces, known as Peshmerga, killed in the battle against Islamic State.
Prior to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the jihadist largely blamed for stoking a civil war between Iraq’s Sunnis and Shi’ites, led a group in the area called Ansar al-Islam, which merged with Islamic State in 2014.
Many of the Iranian and Iraqi Kurds now fighting with Islamic State are part of a second generation of militants largely influenced by Zarqawi’s deadly legacy, Iraqi security officials and Peshmerga commanders familiar with the matter say.
Sunni IS militants see Shi’ites, who make up the majority of Iran’s population, as apostates and have repeatedly threatened to carry out attacks in the Islamic Republic. Kurds make up about ten percent of Iranians and are predominantly Sunni.
Hamai Hama Seid, a senior Peshmerga commander and member of the Iraqi Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party, said Kurdish IS militants take advantage of their knowledge of the language and region as well as strong cross-border ties.
""There are definitely ties between the Iranian and Iraqi extremists on the two sides of the border,"" Seid told Reuters in the Iraqi border village of Tawila, only a few hundred meters from the Iranian border. He added: 
""The militants exploited this area because it’s mountainous, difficult and wooded.""
Many of the young men are poorly educated and have few economic opportunities, allowing extremist recruiters to flourish, Iraqi security officials and Peshmerga commanders say. 
JUNE ATTACK
Iranian authorities say the arms cache found on the border was going to be used to attack civilians in public areas, a follow-up to the shocking assault on the parliament in Tehran and the mausoleum of the founder of Iran's revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, last June that left at least 18 people dead and dozens wounded.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for that assault and threatened more. The Revolutionary Guards responded by raining missiles on the militants in Syria and arresting dozens of suspects in Iran.
The June attack was conceived by an Iraqi militant using the nom de guerre Abu Aisha, a senior commander in a unit of Islamic State fighting in Iraq and Syria made up exclusively of Kurds, according to the Iranian ministry of intelligence.
The Tehran attackers fought in Mosul and Raqqa and trained outside Iran, the ministry said.
Photos posted online show Abu Aisha, a member of Ansar al-Islam prior to joining Islamic State, beheading Peshmerga soldiers while wearing a traditional Kurdish outfit. 
In the fall of 2016, a number of Kurdish Islamic State militants led by Abu Aisha came to an Iraqi border village near Halabja to try to establish a base of operations which could carry out attacks in both Iran and Iraq, according to Iraqi security officials familiar with the matter. 
Peshmerga killed Abu Aisha in December 2016, according to Iraqi security officials and Kurdish activist Mokhtar Hooshmand, who was jailed in Iran on national security charges from 2010 to 2012 and met dozens of Sunni extremists behind bars.
Afterward, Serias Sadeghi, who ran a bakery with his brother in Paveh, an Iranian town about 15 km (9 miles) from the border, took over as lead planner for the Tehran attacks, Hooshmand said by telephone from outside Iran. 
Sadeghi knew Abu Aisha and had crossed back and forth into Iraq with him multiple times.
""Sadeghi was still very eager that this operation be carried out,"" Hooshmand said. ""He played a key role.""
During the attack on Khomeini's mausoleum, Sadeghi detonated a suicide vest, shooting up an orange fireball captured on amateur video. The other four attackers were also killed.
Critics of the Iranian government say the Islamic Republic is reaping what they sowed in the area: it failed to crack down earlier on the militants because they served as a counter-balance to secular groups who opposed the central government.
The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), an Iranian opposition group fighting for greater autonomy for the Kurdish community, posted a report online in 2014 about militants spreading propaganda for Islamic State and trying to recruit young men for the group in Iran. They named Sadeghi as an individual actively recruiting in Paveh.
""They were in most of the mosques in Kurdistan and spread propaganda but none of them were arrested by the Islamic Republic,"" said Mohammad Saleh Ghaderi, a representative of the PDKI in Erbil.
Attempts to reach representatives from the Iranian Ministry of Interior were not successful. But documents show Iranian authorities were aware of the growing threat.
A report issued by Iran's Ministry of Interior noted in 2014: ""Many Salafist Iranian Kurds have announced the readiness to join Islamic State in Iraq and many have traveled to Syria.
""Salafi and Takfiri Iranian groups are pumping Iranian Kurdish youth toward Islamic State and sending them to Iraq,"" the report said, using terms employed by Iranian officials to describe Sunni religious extremists.

""Not a day goes by that funerals are not held for them in Iranian Kurdistan and Iraqi Kurdistan,"" the report said. It added: ""In the future we will witness a large number of Iranian Kurds ... joining Islamic State.""

92,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 06:21AM ET</span>",'Judge me': Paris suspect refuses to answer Belgian court,"By Julie Carriat and Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The prime surviving suspect in the 2015 Islamic State attacks on Paris said he would answer no questions as his trial in Belgium over a shooting that preceded his arrest got under way in Brussels on Monday.
Salah Abdeslam, 28, his long black hair and beard a stark contrast to the cropped, clean-shaven young man familiar across Europe from wanted posters during his four months on the run, was asked by the judge to rise and identify himself.
Appearing in public for the first time since the November 2015 attacks and his arrest in Brussels four months later, he remained seated, flanked by two masked Belgian police officers. 
""I do not wish to answer questions,"" Abdeslam said.
After a first session during which his alleged accomplice admitted to having fought for Islamic State in Syria and said that both accused were present during the March 2016 shootout with Brussels police, the judge again asked Abdeslam to speak.
Citing his right to silence and declaring his Muslim faith, he accused the media of condemning him before his trial: ""Judge me. Do as you want with me,"" he told the judge.
""I put my trust in my Lord.""
""I remain silent. That is a right which I have,"" he said, adding: ""My silence does not make me a criminal or guilty.
""I am defending myself by remaining silent."" 
He asked the prosecution to base itself on forensic evidence ""and not swagger about to satisfy public opinion"", adding: ""Muslims are judged and treated in the worst kind of ways. They are judged without mercy. There is no presumption of innocence.""
That reluctance to engage with the court may prove a disappointment to Parisians who hoped that he might end more than two years of silence to give some indication of how and why the attacks which killed 130 people were organized. 
His trial in France is not expected until next year. He was not charged over the Islamic State attacks in Brussels four days after his arrest, though prosecutors say the suicide bombers who killed 32 people acted swiftly out of fear that Abdeslam might reveal plans for a new attack in France under interrogation.
SHOOTOUT
Among those attending the trial was Bob de Zwart, who survived the gun attack during a rock concert at Paris's Bataclan concert hall on Friday, Nov. 13, 2015. He told Reuters that he had come to Brussels because he wanted to see Abdeslam.
He was, however, not surprised that the alleged lone survivor of the group had not broken his two-year silence.
Abdeslam arrived under heavy guard from France, where he has been held under 24-hour suicide watch near Paris. He will spend the nights of the coming week of Belgian hearings in a high-security French prison just across the border.
Co-accused Sofien Ayari, a 24-year-old Tunisian, told the court that he had been with Islamic State forces in Syria. He said he had been with Abdeslam at the site of the shootout, though only a third man, who was killed by police marksmen, had he said, fired on the police officers who raided their hideout.
In the trial, which relates only to the incident on March 15, 2016, in the southern Brussels borough of Forest, Ayari and Abdeslam face up to 40 years in prison for attempted murder in the context of terrorism. 
Three days later, Abdeslam and Ayari were arrested in the western Brussels borough of Molenbeek, close to the former's family home. A French citizen, he was born and raised among the Belgian capital's large Moroccan immigrant community.
Lawyers for Abdeslam accept that he was in Paris when gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 at the Bataclan, near the national stadium and at cafes and restaurants.

His elder brother, with whom he ran a bar in Brussels, was among those who blew himself up. Prosecutors believe the younger Abdeslam, whom they accuse of running logistics for the attack including ferrying fighters from Syria across Europe, would have met the same fate had his explosive vest not malfunctioned.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A dozen EU countries want to bring the six western Balkan nations into European Union policy meetings even before they join the bloc, according to a policy paper seen by Reuters, in an effort to improve the bloc's image in the region.
After years of neglecting the six western Balkan countries and looking to counter growing Russian and Chinese influence in the region, the European Commission is set to unveil a plan on Tuesday that lays out how Serbia and Montenegro could become the first of the group to join the EU by 2025.
Now 12 EU nations - Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia - want to go further and propose an annual EU summit with the Western Balkan leaders of Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, the paper said.
In their 12-point proposal handed to the European Commission in late January, the EU countries also want to allow ministers of Balkan governments to participate in top EU meetings in areas including the environment, health, transport and foreign policy.
That would go beyond the ad-hoc meetings and ministerial breakfasts that the EU offers its closest non-member partners. 
""These are cost-free measures that would have a tremendous political impact and would be instrumental in improving the EU's image in the region,"" the proposal said, also urging EU government officials to visit the Balkans more regularly. 
Ending mobile telephone roaming charges for the 18-million strong Balkan population should also be considered, they said.
CHALLENGES
The six countries - all bar Albania emerging from the breakup of Yugoslavia - have long been considered future members.
But amid concerns in Western capitals over the costs of another wave of eastern enlargement and over the slow progress of the region's political, judicial and economic reforms, many citizens in the Balkans are wondering if they will ever join. 
Only a slim majority of Serbs would vote for EU membership in a referendum, a January poll by Serbia's ministry of European integration showed, down from 73 percent in 2009.
Reforming the region throws up formidable challenges. For example, Serbia does not recognize the independence of Kosovo, its former province. Some EU states have also refused to recognize Kosovo, including Spain, which is trying to contain its own separatists in Catalonia.
Germany, the biggest provider of EU funds to candidate countries, is cautious about throwing open the door to the six countries, saying organized crime and corruption are entrenched and the rule of law needs to be assured first.
German diplomats say they are wary of repeating mistakes made in 2007 with Romania and Bulgaria, which many EU officials believe were allowed to join the bloc before they were ready and are still dogged by corruption and a weak judiciary.
However Bulgaria now holds the EU's rotating six-month presidency until June 30 and is keen to champion the membership drive of its Western Balkan neighbors by holding a special Balkan summit in Sofia in May.

And despite its own decision to leave the EU, Britain also backs the group's aspirations to join the bloc and will host another top-level Balkan gathering in July.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Group heir Jay Y. Lee left a South Korean jail a free man on Monday after a panel of judges suspended his sentence, a surprise decision that sent shockwaves through the country's political and business establishments.
Coming just days before South Koreans gather to host the Winter Olympics, the ruling reignited an intense public debate over widespread corruption in a case that ousted President Park Geun-hye from office last year and has ensnared leading members of the family-run ""chaebol"" conglomerates. 
Seoul High Court sentenced Lee to two and a half years in jail on charges including bribery and embezzlement - reducing the original term by half - but suspended the sentence for four years, meaning that he is unlikely to serve any more time in jail.
Lee, 49, heir to one of the world's biggest corporate empires, had been detained since last February.
Emerging from a Seoul detention center where he had briefly returned for his belongings after the ruling, Lee stood in the frigid February air and apologized for ""not showing my best side"". 
""The past year has been a really valuable time of looking back on myself,"" Lee told reporters in a sometimes shaky voice.
He added he needed to visit his ailing father, Samsung Group patriarch Lee Kun-hee, who suffered a heart attack in 2014. 
The elder Lee escaped a conviction for embezzlement and tax evasion when he was pardoned by former President Lee Myung-bak, viewed by some as a move to allow the elder Lee to lead the campaign to secure the 2018 Winter Olympics for South Korea. 
Coming days ahead of the Olympics in Pyeongchang, the decision to free Jay Y. Lee presents a new headache for President Moon Jae-in, who was elected last year on an anti-corruption platform in the wake of Park's impeachment.
""This may be a brave decision by the court to look at solid evidence rather than public opinion. But this doesn't quite fit public opinion calling for Lee's punishment,"" Kim Kyung-soo, a former prosecutor and a criminal lawyer, told Reuters
CORRUPTION CHARGES
Former President Park was dismissed in March after being impeached in a case that brought scrutiny to the cozy ties between South Korea's political leaders and its largest chaebol, the so-called ""Republic of Samsung"". 
Park, who denies wrongdoing, is standing trial accused of bribery, abuse of power and coercion. Receiving bribes can carry a sentence of life in jail.
One of the judges who suspended Lee's sentence said Park had pressured the corporate leader to sponsor equestrian sports, which could have a bearing on Park's verdict, legal experts said. 
Partially agreeing with a lower court's ruling in August, the High Court convicted Lee of bribing Park by supporting the equestrian career of the daughter of a friend of hers. He was also convicted of embezzlement. 
But the appeals court said Lee did not seek any help from Park. It also said just 3.6 billion won ($3.31 million) was paid as a bribe, not 7.2 billion as the lower court had said. 
Presiding senior judge Cheong Hyung-sik also called the nature of Lee's involvement in Samsung's support for Park's friend ""passive compliance to political power"". 
""Park threatened Samsung Electronics executives,"" the judge said. ""The defendant provided a bribe, knowing it was bribery to support (the friend's daughter), but was unable to refuse."" 
Prosecutors did not have an immediate comment. Lee's lawyer, Lee In-jae, said the defense will appeal to the Supreme Court to try to overturn the convictions.
BUSINESS AS USUAL?
Lee, wearing a dark suit and white shirt and looking noticeably worn, did not show any emotion when the ruling was announced. 
With the end of his year-long detention, which according to local media he adjusted to with physical workouts and reading books, Lee can return to his multiple corporate roles, including as director of flagship Samsung Electronics (KS:005930). 
Shares in Samsung Electronics, of which Lee is vice chairman, reversed earlier losses and closed up 0.5 percent, compared to a 1.3 percent fall in the wider market. (KS11) 
Investors say Lee will face the daunting tasks of trying to find the right direction for growth and making big investment decisions, although Samsung Electronics, the world's biggest maker of semiconductors and smartphones, performed well with Lee behind bars for the past year.
""Lee will have to decide which business to grow to continue Samsung Electronics' robust growth, thanks to memory chips,"" said Park Jung-hoon, fund manager at HDC Asset Management that owns shares in Samsung Electronics.
""Lee's biggest goal for now is to show what is the next step that Samsung Group will take, while continuing its shareholder-friendly actions,"" he added. 
The cloud of controversy, however, may mean Lee will take a lower profile, said Kim, the former prosecutor. 
""Although he deserves the presumption of innocence, he will still be tried at the Supreme Court, which could hurt the corporate image if he is active as a vice chairman or a director at Samsung,"" Kim said.

With relations strained over Syria, Ukraine and U.S. allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, something Moscow denies, ties between the two countries have slid to a post-Cold War low. 
The U.S. Treasury Department last week named 210 people, including 96 ""oligarchs"" with wealth of $1 billion or more, on a list of people deemed to be close to the Kremlin as part of a sanctions package signed into law in August last year.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that unspecified sanctions would ""come out"" of the report. 
Ryabkov told Izvestia that Moscow had previously hit back at the United States by suspending agreements in the nuclear sphere, expanding its list of U.S. politicians it deems anti-Russian, and by ordering half the staff at the U.S. embassy in Russia to leave.
""We still have similar measures left in our arsenal,"" said Ryabkov. 
""But their possible activation is subject to a separate political decision.""
Such a decision, if it was taken, would be made by President Vladimir Putin after he had assessed ""a combination of factors.""
""We need to assess the consequences (of the oligarch list) from the point of view of how it is used,"" said Ryabkov.

Despite the poor state of U.S.-Russia relations, Ryabkov said Moscow remained keen to try to make progress with the United States when it came to a raft of arms control and de-confliction pacts.

In a video circulated on social media last month, John Tshibangu, who had been based in the east of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), gave the president a 45-day ultimatum to leave or ""we are going to take Kabila down"".
But Tshibangu was then detained by authorities in Tanzania toward the end of last month.
""John Tshibangu is in Kinshasa. We are going to leave him to face justice for rebellion, a crime catered for and punished by the Congolese penal code,"" Defence Minister Crispin Atama Tabe told Reuters by text message.
Tshibangu used to be a military commander in the central Congolese region of Kasai. He defected in 2012 and moved to the lawless east, long a haunt of would-be Congolese rebels.
Kabila's refusal to step down when his mandate expired in December 2016 has emboldened several armed groups, fuelling violence and raising the prospect of the vast, mineral-rich nation sliding back into the kind of wars that killed millions in the 1990s, mostly from hunger and disease.

Sheikhzadeh, 61, admitted that he had not disclosed his income from the mission, which was paid in cash, on his tax returns, but called the prison sentence ""very unfair"" and said his prosecution had been an attempt to coerce him to act as an informant from within the Iran mission.

""This verdict was politically motivated as the Americans are constantly engaging in psychological warfare against Iran.""

Tourism accounts for about 12 percent of gross domestic product in Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, making it one of the most important drivers of growth. The biggest number of foreign visitors come from China.

MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - The Iraqis who have come home to Mosul's Old City knew it would be hard living in the rubble left by the battle against Islamic State, but there is one aspect of their surroundings they are finding unbearable seven months on.
""I don’t want my children to have to walk past dead bodies in the street every day,"" said Abdelrazaq Abdullah, back with his wife and three children in the quarter where the militants made their last stand in July against Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition forces.
""We can live without electricity, but we need the government to clear the corpses – they're spreading disease and reminding us of the horrors we've just lived through.""
The stench of death wafts from rubble-filled corners in the dystopian wasteland of what was once West Mosul, from rusting cars still rigged with explosives and from homes abandoned as those who could, fled the bloody end of the militants three-year rule.
The corpses lying in the open on many streets are mainly militants from the extremist Sunni group who retreated to the densely-packed buildings of the Old City, where only the most desperate 5,000 of a pre-war population of 200,000 have so far returned.
Local residents and officials in predominantly Sunni Mosul say there are also thousands of civilian bodies yet to be retrieved from the ruins, a view which has put them at odds with the Shi'ite-led government in Baghdad.
""There are no more civilian bodies to be picked up in Mosul,"" said Brig Gen Mohammad Mahmoud, the head of Mosul's Civil Defence, first responders who report to the Interior Ministry and are tasked with collecting them and issuing death certificates.
The Civil Defence says it had collected 2,585 civilian bodies by mid-January – many of them still unidentified - and has completed operations. It does not want to waste resources on the militants.
“Why should we have to give terrorists a proper burial?” Mahmoud said.
The standoff over the dead threatens to stoke the anger of a population already beaten down by a grueling war and the militants' draconian rule in a place where Islamic State initially found some sympathy. The final civilian death toll is also a highly sensitive political issue in Iraq and beyond.

COMMON GRAVES
The municipal government has had to set up its own specialized team to field requests filed by city residents to find more than 9,000 missing people, most of them last seen in the Old City and assumed to be buried under the rubble.
The team is working through a backlog of 300 bodies, dispatching groups to collect them when it can. But these are just the ones where exact coordinates have been given by neighbors, family members or passers-by who saw the bodies.
""We don’t know how many more are under the rubble,"" said Duraid Hazim Mohammed, the head of the municipal team. ""If the family or a witness who saw the people die doesn’t call us to tell us exactly how many bodies are at a site, we have no way of knowing if one, five or 100 bodies are buried there.""
Locals say common graves were dug as the battle raged. In the courtyard of Um al-Tisaa mosque in the Old City, they say 100 of their neighbors were buried in groups of shallow graves.
""I buried between 50 and 60 people myself, by hand, as planes flew overhead and bombed the city,"" resident Mahmoud Karim said.
Several families have since come to excavate the bodies of their relatives, to bury them in proper cemeteries. ""But others, we don’t know where their families are,"" Karim said. Some are dead, while others are among the thousands lingering uneasily in refugee camps or paying high rents elsewhere in the city.
The municipal government in Mosul has not given an exact figure for civilian casualties, but its head, Abdelsattar al-Hibbu, told Reuters it coincided with estimates of 10,000 civilians killed during the battle, based on reports of missing people and information from officials about the dead. The toll includes victims of ground fighting and coalition bombing.
Asked for comment, a U.S. coalition spokesman directed Reuters to publicly available reports of incidents. A tally based on those reports showed that the U.S. military acknowledges 321 deaths based on ""credible allegations"" in dozens of reports of civilian casualties from coalition air strikes conducted near Mosul.
A further 100 reports of casualties from coalition air strikes near Mosul, each referring either to one or to multiple deaths, were still under investigation, the data showed.

FIGHTERS
While the most visible problem in Mosul is the corpses of fighters left in the streets, residents say they have also found bodies of suspected Islamic State family members in their homes.
The owner of a house in the Old City, who asked Reuters to withhold his name for fear of retaliation from officials, said he had asked the Civil Defence for weeks to come and remove two bodies from the main bedroom of his basement home.
They were badly decomposed but the clothing was clearly that of a woman and child.
“Civil Defence refused, because they say the woman and child are Daesh,” he said using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State. “They said they’re punishing me because they think I supported Daesh.”
The municipality team has collected 348 bodies of militants so far, but there are many more still around. Residents regularly walk by them to collect water from temporary pumps and on one street, young children played not far from two corpses on a doorstep.
Some of the fighters are recognizable from their clothing, some were identified to the government by neighbors, some yet, were found clutching the weapons they used to make their last stand against surrounding Iraqi and coalition forces.
The municipal government team’s efforts are hampered by very limited funds. On several days in January, they had to halt operations amid a shortage of gloves, masks and body bags.
Some families have resorted to digging out their dead themselves, like 23-year-old Mustafa Nader, who came back to look for his great-uncle Abdullah Ahmed Hussain.
""We weren’t sure if we would find him here,"" Nader said of his elderly sculptor uncle, tears in his eyes after an hour of digging unearthed his body. ""I thought maybe he could have left or gone to a neighbor's house.""
Others still have resorted to drastic measures.
Ayad came back in early January after six months in a refugee camp and found the corpses of three Islamic State fighters rotting in what remained of his living room. ""The flies, the smell, the disease,"" he said. ""It was awful.""
The municipality team said it would be weeks before they could get to him so Ayad asked a soldier on patrol to look over the bodies and make sure there were no explosives.
Then, Ayad set them on fire.
With most of his money spent on a tarp to cover the gaping hole where his front door once stood, he borrowed $20 from his sister, for bleach to try to erase the traces so his family of ten could move back in.

""The smell still hasn’t fully gone away,"" he said.

The man was wielding a large knife, according to Tasnim news agency, and was wearing white shroud, symbolizing his readiness to sacrifice his life.

The crackdown, which has extended to the national medical association, has deepened concerns about free speech under President Tayyip Erdogan, who has criticized opponents of the military intervention as ""traitors"".
Turkey last month launched an air and ground offensive, dubbed Operation Olive Branch, against the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria's northwestern Afrin region. Authorities have repeatedly warned they would prosecute those opposing, criticizing or misrepresenting the incursion.
""Since the start of Operation Olive Branch, 449 people have been detained for spreading terrorist propaganda on social media and 124 people detained for taking part in protest action,"" the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
The operation has been widely supported by Turkey's mainly pro-government media and by most political parties, with the exception of the pro-Kurdish opposition. 
Last week, a prosecutor ordered the detention of 11 senior members of the Turkish Medical Association, including its chairman, after the organization criticized the incursion, saying: ""No to war, peace immediately"".
Erdogan criticized the body as traitors. Detention orders were issued for another 13 people for supporting the medics.
Three of the doctors were later released on probation, according to the Hurriyet newspaper.
""There are laws that prohibit the glorification of terrorism, support for terrorism through propaganda and media. The prosecutors are implementing the laws,"" Erdogan's spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, told reporters in Istanbul at the weekend. 
Ankara considers the U.S.-backed YPG, which controls Afrin, to be a terrorist group and an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which has fought an insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast since 1984.
Turkey is in the midst of a widening crackdown that began after a failed coup attempt in July 2016. Some 50,000 people have been jailed and 150,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs.
Critics, including rights groups and some Western allies, say Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent. The latest arrests have also drawn criticism from the European Union.

Turkey says its measures are necessary due to the gravity of the security threats it faces.

In a Friday speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the U.S. Treasury's top economic diplomat, David Malpass, said China's focus on commodities and opaque financing deals had hurt, not helped, countries in the region.
His attack on China's role in aiding the Venezuelan government came a day after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, ahead of a five-day tour of Latin America, raised the prospect of a military coup in the oil-rich country.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said financial cooperation between the two countries was set by companies and financial bodies in both nations on commercial, win-win principles. 
Loans were totally in accordance with international standards and benefited local people, he added.
""What the United States said is baseless and extremely irresponsible,"" Geng said.
Cooperation between China and Venezuela had supported the building of more than 10,000 low-cost houses, electricity generation and the cost of household appliances for three million Venezuelan homes on low incomes, he added.
""China-Venezuela cooperation has favourably promoted Venezuela's socio-economic development and has been welcomed and supported by all levels of society,"" Geng said.
""A stable Venezuela accords with the interests of all sides.""
China last week said the United States was disrespecting Latin America after Tillerson warned countries in the region against excessive reliance on economic ties with China.
The Trump administration has imposed individual and economic sanctions on Venezuela's government for rights abuses and corruption. Maduro has accused Washington of seeking to oust him to improve access to the OPEC nation's oil wealth.
China and Venezuela have a close diplomatic and business relationship, especially in energy. China has repeatedly brushed off widespread condemnation from the United States, Europe and others about the situation in the country.
China has said it is confident in Venezuela's ability to properly handle its debts. Venezuela has borrowed billions of dollars from Russia and China, primarily through oil-for-loan deals that have crimped the country's hard currency revenue by requiring oil shipments to be used to service those loans.

Since 2007, China has loaned more than $50 billion to Venezuela through an oil-for-loans arrangement that helped Caracas reduce reliance on U.S. energy markets. But the flow of funds from Beijing has slowed since 2014, when abundant crude oil led to a crash in oil markets and made China less interested in maintaining its alliance with Venezuela.

MANILA Reuters) - As night falls in Manila, the Philippine capital, few of the 700 families living in the sprawling portside shanty town known as Market 3 dare to venture out of their homes.
The crime-ridden maze of sheet metal, crumbling cement and wooden boards has become a frontline of the bloody war on illegal drugs that has defined Rodrigo Duterte's presidency since it was unleashed in June 2016. (Click http://reut.rs/2DVQaYM for a picture package depicting the shanty town of Market 3.)
Dozens of Filipinos who lived along the slum's narrow dirt-floor alleys have wound up dead. The community lives in fear of masked or mystery men dragging away slum dwellers, or police and their notorious ""Tokhang"" operations, where officers are required to knock on doors of suspected dealers to urge them to surrender. But those visits have been fatal.
""Many people have left. They leave because of Tokhang,"" said Nenita Bravo, a 56-year-old Market 3 resident. 
""We can't really count them anymore,"" she said, referring to those killed, adding that she had witnessed many killings in the area. ""We can't really count them because there's been so many."" 
Bullet-ridden corpses are found hours or even days later, often just a few minutes away, although police say there have been no illegal killings in their anti-drug campaign.
Yet the frequent police operations and shadowy murders have hit the slum hard and those who live there say more blood has been spilled since he was elected president on the promise to wipe out drugs and crime in six months.
""Since Duterte came, that's when there was a rise in killings. It was pitiful, especially so for the many women killed,"" said Visitacion Castellano, 73, a long-time resident of Market 3.
""They should have given them years. Put them in jail. But not kill.""
In Spanish colonial times, Navotas, as the area was known before the patchwork of shanty communities emerged, was the home of a middle class that lived off the sea, either as owners of fishing boats or shipbuilders.
Now employment is in short supply, with men jumping from one informal job to the next, such as scavenging or unloading fish from returning trawlers.
Although life is hard, people get by, but there is never enough.
Scarcity fuels desperation and the desperate turn to petty crime, or dealing and using drugs, mostly ""shabu"", the methamphetamine Duterte says could destroy a generation of Filipinos.
One 28-year-old man who spoke to Reuters was among those who sold and used shabu. During one of the deadliest chapters of the drugs war in August 2016, he said his partner and mother of his five children was murdered, her body found riddled with bullet wounds in the head and chest.
DESPERATE TIMES
The former drug user, who refused to give his name for fear of reprisals, then fled Market 3 and says many of his friends did the same, or are now dead. He even tried, unsuccessfully, to take his own life, he said, by hanging himself with his belt.
The man is in poor health, skinny and coughing frequently due to tuberculosis. Nuns now take care of his youngest children.
Too weak to work, he spends his days at the port waiting to beg for scraps of fish from returning boats.
His dream, he says, is to regain strength so he can work, and build a home for himself and his children in the Market 3 shanty town where they can live, free of drugs and the fear of police raids.
""My only concern now is for my four kids to have a different life,"" he said. 
One woman in the community told Reuters that four of her seven children are in prison, three on drugs charges and one accused of murder.
Her youngest son was killed in June 2016 in what police said was a sting operation in which he was armed, and refused to go quietly, a typical description of the almost 4,000 cases in which police say a suspected drug dealer was killed.
Police in Navotas could not be reached for comment on the killings during their anti-drugs operations. 
The woman, who asked for anonymity, is certain that police killed her son in cold blood while he was asleep, adding that she even heard them joke about it. 

Reuters could not independently verify her account.

Senator Antonio Trillanes asked the Senate committee on banks, financial institutions and currencies to probe deposits and investments involving their accounts, which he said could show possible violations of the country's anti-money laundering law.
Duterte has cultivated an image as a humble man who disdains opulence and is uninterested in wealth and materialism.
Trillanes has long accused Duterte of failing to disclose his wealth going back to his time as mayor of southern Davao City prior to winning the presidency in May 2016.
Duterte has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and promised to resign if there was proof. 
The president has even instructed the country's Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) to disclose the transactions, yet he has still to sign the required waiver for that to happen.
Trillanes cited a recent report by VERA Files, a local investigative news organization, which said Duterte and daughter Sara Duterte-Carpio, who succeeded him as Davao mayor, failed to disclose deposits and investments exceeding 100 million pesos ($1.94 million) in their official asset declarations.
Duterte-Carpio also denies wrongdoing.
VERA Files said the bank records it saw came from the Senate and were entered into records by Trillanes himself, who claimed the same documents came from the AMLC.
The presidential palace dismissed Trillanes' allegation as ""old news"" and said the lawmaker has no proof.
""The council had said those documents did not come from them and that the data he was talking about was incorrect,"" said Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque.
Roque said any plan to oust the highly popular leader would fail.
The deputy ombudsman last year initiated an inquiry into allegations that Duterte had hidden assets. The president's office last week sought his removal.

Duterte has sparred repeatedly with Trillanes. Last year, he alleged that the senator had secret overseas bank accounts and read out the account number of one live on television. Duterte later admitted, however, that he had deliberately read out a false account number, but did not say why.

Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular briefing that “Chinese citizens who are preparing in the near term to go to the Maldives temporarily not go to the Maldives before the situation on the ground stabilizes.”

The raid on a house in the al-Tabbaneh district of Tripoli aimed to capture Hajar al-Abdullah, but was met with resistance including gunshots and hand grenades, the army said on its website. 
In the fighting, Abdullah and a soldier were killed, several other soldiers were wounded, and Abdullah's brother, Bilal al-Abdullah, was detained. The army seized money, arms, ammunition and other military hardware from the house, it said. 
Lebanese authorities say they have disrupted a number of Islamic State attacks and networks since the last major attack - a 2015 twin suicide bombing in Beirut. 
Lebanon has mostly escaped the rash of militant assaults around the Middle East spurred by the war in its neighbor Syria, and last year forced Islamic State fighters out of an enclave on the mountainous border between the two countries.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Former TV anchor and evangelical singer Fabricio Alvarado Munoz will face a center-left fiction writer in Costa Rica's presidential election runoff, definitively ending decades of a two-party system in the peaceful Central American nation.
The Christian songwriter decisively won the first round on Sunday but after failing to reach 40 percent of the votes must now compete in the runoff on April 1 against ex-government minister Carlos Alvarado Quesada, who was also once a singer in a prog-rock band.
The victory of the unrelated Alvarados reflects the growing influence of relative outsiders on politics in Latin America, where some two-thirds of the region's population can choose new governments this year.
""Costa Rica went to vote and the message was clear, it doesn't want more of the same,"" Alvarado Munoz, 43, said in a speech to supporters as the final results came in. 
The shift has hastened the decline of a centrist two-party system that stretched back decades, and led to the rise of Alvarado Munoz on a ticket of fiercely opposing gay marriage.
Neither of the candidates is from one of the two parties that have dominated politics since the mid 20th Century, and they represent a widening of the right-left divide.
Alvarado Munoz, the telegenic author of Christian songs such as ""Your love is everything"", won 24.8 percent of the vote. He was elected to the national assembly in 2014 as the only federal deputy for the National Restoration Party (PRN) formed by Christians from another party.
Late on Sunday, the PRN appeared to have massively increased its presence in the national assembly to 14 seats. The party opposes the progressive policies of President Luis Guillermo Solis, such as same-sex marriage, in vitro fertilization and sex education in schools. 
""There's nothing more progressive than defending life and family,"" Alvarado Munoz said on Sunday.
Well known as a television news anchor before he turned more seriously to religion and politics, Alvarado Munoz shot to prominence during the campaign after denouncing a ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights calling on Costa Rica to give civil marriage rights to same-sex couples.
""All the vestiges of gender ideology will be eliminated from public policy in Costa Rica,"" he said in his government plan.
During the campaign, a video was released of his wife apparently ""speaking in tongues"", a phenomenon that evangelicals say allows them to communicate in a divine language. 
DRAMATIKA
His rival Alvarado Quesada, 38, backs the court's decision on same-sex couples. Even though Costa Rica's 3.3 million voters mostly describe themselves as conservative, he appears to have benefited by energizing voters worried by the strident tone of the campaign. 
The former Procter & Gamble employee also tried to connect with young voters, highlighting his university rock band Dramatika and career as a fiction writer. He has a masters degree from Britain's Sussex University, and his last novel was titled ""Brighton Season"". 
""The Costa Rica of the 21st century needs a government that knows how to advance with strength, love and happiness, the agenda of equality,"" Alvarado Quesada said in a speech on Sunday evening. He won 21.6 percent of the vote in the first round.
The two Alvarados will now fight for the votes of third place Antonio Alvarez Desanti, who accepted defeat on Sunday evening with 18.8 percent of the vote, and the 10 other candidates from the first round.

No matter who wins, the next president will have to work with other parties in Congress to get legislation passed.

Trinh Xuan Thanh, a former official whom Germany said was kidnapped by Vietnamese agents in a Berlin park in scenes reminiscent of the Cold War, was jailed for life for embezzling assets form Petroleum Power Property JSC (PV Power Land), the state-run Voice of Vietnam news website reported.
Thanh was a former chairman of PetroVietnam Construction. Both companies are units of Vietnam's state oil and gas group PetroVietnam, among the biggest firms in the Southeast Asian nation.
PetroVietnam is at the heart of Vietnam's widespread corruption crackdown initiated by the ruling Communist Party.

This follows a decision last week by a Singapore court to reject a prosecution appeal to reinstate longer jail sentences for the church leaders, after the High Court reduced their sentences in April 2017. 
The government believes the sentences are ""too low"" for those including City Harvest Church's co-founder Kong Hee, convicted of using funds to support his wife's pop-singing career, Minister for Law Kasiviswanathan Shanmugam said.
Kong, 53, was originally sentenced to eight years in jail in October 2015 for criminal breach of trust and falsification of accounts. The High Court later reduced that sentence to three-and-a-half years.
""It is now up to parliament to amend the law, and that we should do soon,"" Shanmugam said in parliament on Monday.
Singapore's governing People's Action Party has a large majority in parliament. 
Shanmugam said the judgment shows there is a ""lacuna"" or gap in the law around punishment for senior officers charged with criminal breach of trust.
""The government's policy is clear ... If you abuse that trust you should be more culpable, and you should be liable for more severe punishments compared to a normal employee.
""For the last 40 years the law, as applied by the courts, reflected this principle. In April last year, the position changed."" 
The mix of money, faith and scandal in the City Harvest Church case is unique in Singapore, and gained much public interest during a legal battle that spanned nearly five years.
Local media said it was the largest amount of charity funds ever misappropriated in Singapore, and the country's most expensive criminal trial. 

While megachurches originated in the United States, some of the largest are in Asia, where packaging the traditional biblical message into a more dynamic format of pop music, lively services and social media has lured a new generation of followers and turned the churches into major enterprises.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A petition calling for the resignation of Thailand's deputy prime minister attracted thousands of signatures on Monday, heaping pressure on the junta's second-in-command to step aside amid a scandal over a luxury watch and undeclared assets.
The scandal has revealed growing signs of disgruntlement among the Thai public, and added to uncertainty over whether the junta will call an election later this year that is supposed to move the Southeast Asian nation back toward democracy.
The National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) placed Prawit Wongsuwan, 72, a former army chief who is also defense minister, under investigation after his appearance in a photograph of the cabinet wearing a diamond ring and a luxury watch in December sparked an avalanche of criticism on social media.
Thai netizens have since identified 25 expensive luxury watches that the former general has worn but not declared to the anti-graft body.
Prawit has said that he borrowed the timepieces from friends, but would resign if that was the public's wish.
According to Thailand's anti-corruption act, all political office holders must fully disclose all of their assets.
On Monday, a Change.org petition calling for Prawit's resignation had more than 61,200 signatures.
The minister was attending a defense conference in Singapore on Monday, and a spokesman said he was in ""good health"", without specifically addressing the watch issue.
""I would like to confirm that General Prawit Wongsuwan, deputy prime minister and defence minister ... is in good health and is ready to dedicate himself to looking after the country's security,"" Defence Ministry spokesman Kongcheep Tantrawanich, told reporters.
The scandal is a sore point for the junta, whose promise to rid Thailand's politics of corruption was central to its premise for staging a 2014 coup.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who has said a general election will take place in November, last week asked for more time in office to prepare the country for the vote.
Signs of growing impatience with the junta has been manifest in a steady stream of protests calling for a quick return to democracy and in defiance of a junta crackdown on freedom of assembly.
On Saturday, students at a football match wheeled out parade floats poking fun at Prawit while a Bangkok street artist who depicted Prawit's face in an alarm clock said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post that he was facing police intimidation. 
Reuters was unable to immediately contact police for comment.
The NACC has said it will conclude its probe this month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Economic talks between the United States and Japan, tackling topics from persimmons and potatoes to energy and infrastructure, have helped keep Tokyo clear of protectionist moves such as those that recently hit Chinese solar panels and South Korean washers.
Japan hopes that ""let's talk"" approach - plus warm personal ties between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Donald Trump - will keep friction in check. But officials and lawmakers say the outlook could change if the unpredictable U.S. leader turns his attention to Tokyo's 7 trillion yen ($63.62 billion)trade surplus ahead of U.S. congressional elections in November.
""Naturally, America wants an early conclusion to what to do about its trade deficit (with Japan). Of course, they are concerned about the mid-term elections and may say various things,” said a ruling party lawmaker well-versed in U.S.-Japan economic ties, one of eight officials and lawmakers interviewed by Reuters who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject.
""Suga is worried,"" he added, referring to Abe’s close aide, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.
Efforts to showcase the U.S.-Japan security alliance in the face of North Korea's nuclear and missile threats will probably take precedence over trade when U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visits Japan from Tuesday, officials on both sides said.
Pence will not hold a formal third round of the so-called ""economic dialogue"" with Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso while in Tokyo. The two last met for a second round in October, when, among other things, they agreed to lift restrictions on Japanese persimmon exports and U.S. Idaho potato imports as well as streamline noise and emissions testing for U.S. auto imports.
""Japan's strategy could be said to be very simple - keep this channel of economic dialogue open,"" said one Japanese government source familiar with the government's thinking.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's comments late last month that a weak dollar would help U.S. trade imbalances in the short term boosted the yen sharply against the dollar. It was a reminder of how currency could come into focus if trade friction revives.
Japan is waiting to see what decision the White House takes on an inquiry into steel imports under Section 232 of a 1962 U.S. trade law allowing restrictions to protect national security. Action against an ally like Japan or South Korea, two of the sources said, could be problematic.
Japan's largest steelmaker, Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal, has said Japanese exports are not hurting U.S. rivals. ""We hope the U.S. will make a wise decision,"" a company official said.
William Hagerty, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, has said Washington wants to see progress on cutting Japan's trade surplus and forging a bilateral framework - which Tokyo opposes - by spring. 
Hagerty, in an interview with NHK last month, flagged liquefied natural gas (LNG), medicines and farm products as sectors where Washington wants to boost exports.
Increasing LNG exports to Japan, however, could be tough: Japanese buyers have already agreed to buy more U.S. gas than they need. And boosting pharmaceutical exports would run up against Japan's efforts to cut drug prices to curb the rising medical costs of an ageing population.
Washington also pushed again for fewer restrictions on beef shipments and auto exports during working-level talks in late January. Japanese officials argue such problems would have been resolved if the United States had remained in the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal forged under Trump's predecessor.
""We can say, 'Why did you leave TPP? If you were in TPP, these wouldn't be a problem,'"" the ruling party lawmaker said.
Trump surprised many last month by saying he might be willing to rejoin the multilateral trade pact - if it were renegotiated to benefit the United States.
Abe has rejected the idea of reopening talks on the delicately balanced pact, though some sources said Tokyo might eventually act as a bridge to lure Washington back with minor changes that Trump could sell back home as a victory.
One option, sources said, is to present plans already in the works to buy more U.S. military gear as a gesture to please Trump, who brought up the sector during a November visit to Tokyo.
Japan plans to buy 410.2 billion yen worth of U.S. military equipment in the year starting in April and is working on a new five-year overall procurement plan that would start in 2019.
Still, some politicians expressed frustration with a U.S. playbook that appears to hark back to the 1980s, when Japan accounted for a much bigger chunk of the U.S. trade deficit and its companies had yet to step up their direct investment in America.
Trade in Japanese goods accounts for less than 10 percent of the U.S. deficit, compared with China's more than 40 percent.
""When it comes to what to do in concrete terms, everyone is at a loss,"" the lawmaker said. ""The situation is completely different from the trade friction of the 1980s.""

QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuadoreans on Sunday voted to prevent presidents from holding more than two terms in office, according to the elections council, a win for President Lenin Moreno that blocks his mentor-turned-adversary Rafael Correa from returning to power. 
The results from the referendum, called by Moreno, roll back a measure Correa pushed through Congress in 2015 to allow unlimited presidential re-election.
""The victory of the 'yes' vote opens the path for us to work together, confrontation is a thing of the past,"" Moreno said in a televised broadcast, an apparent reference to Correa's famously combative style. ""The old politicians will not return.""
Moreno may now be emboldened to remove Correa allies from key government posts, and financial markets will likely see the result as confirming a more politically and fiscally conservative future for the South American oil exporting country.
The elections council said some 64 percent of voters had supported changing the re-election rules, while 36 percent of voters were opposed. 
It cited a quick count, which uses the results of a representative sample of polling stations to estimate the winner. The full results are expected for Monday.
The referendum is legally binding and implies a direct change to the constitution.
Voters also gave broad backing to six other measures, including limits on oil production and mining in environmentally sensitive areas, and stiffer penalties for corruption. Some of those will require the involvement of Congress.
Correa said the referendum was aimed at destroying his legacy. ""The struggle continues,"" he wrote via Twitter. ""We cannot accept such a constitutional rupture."" 
Correa led Ecuador between 2007 and 2017, a period that saw him win support for anti-poverty programs but criticism for excessive confrontation and for allowing corruption to flourish.
He declined to run in 2017 and tapped Moreno, then Vice President, as the ruling party candidate. He now says Moreno is a ""traitor"" seeking to annihilate him politically.
Though he has been living in Brussels with his Belgian wife since leaving office, he has returned several times to whip up support during campaign stops across Ecuador. 

""I've come to understand that Correa stole a lot from us, he fought with everyone, and now he wants to come back as if none of that happened,"" said Maria del Carmen Nauya, 52, a maid, who woke up early to vote in a poor neighborhood in the capital of Quito. She voted to bring back term limits.

The candidate, Taketoyo Toguchi, backed by Abe's ruling coalition, defeated incumbent Susumu Inamine, who opposed moving the U.S. Marines' Futenma air base to his city of Nago in Okinawa's north from a more populous part of the island.
The victory by Toguchi - who stressed boosting Okinawa's economy in his campaign - is expected to give impetus to the long-stalled plan to relocate the base.
The election came just days before U.S. Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled to visit Japan this week on a trip expected to focus on security ties in face of North Korea's nuclear and missile threat.
""I would like to proceed (with the relocation) based on a ruling by the Supreme Court of Japan, while seeking understanding of the public,"" Abe told reporters.
He said he wanted to support Okinawa's development.
Japan's Supreme Court ruled in 2016 in favor of a government plan to relocate the U.S. military base, dealing a blow to islanders' efforts to get rid of the base altogether. 
Japan's central government and authorities on Okinawa - reluctant host to the bulk of U.S. military forces in the country - have bickered for years over the plan, first agreed between Tokyo and Washington in 1996.
Many Okinawa residents have long associated the U.S. military presence with crime, pollution and accidents, and resentment was rekindled by a spate of incidents involving U.S. military aircraft. In December, a window fell from a U.S. helicopter onto a school sports field, fanning safety concerns.

The Nago result could bode ill for Okinawa Governor Takeshi Onaga, another base opponent who is up for re-election later this year.

117,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2018 08:30PM ET</span>","Support for Australian PM hits 10-month high, raises prospect of an early election","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Support for Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is at a near 10-month high, a widely watched poll showed on Monday, a boost for the center-right government that could use an early election to settle a constitutional crisis.
The latest Newspoll, published by The Australian, showed Turnbull’s Liberal-National party coalition now trails the main opposition Labor Party by a margin of 52-48 percent on a two-party basis, the smallest gap since April 2017.
The poll raises the prospect of an early election as Turnbull's razor thin one-seat majority in Australia's parliament is again threatened by a previously little known constitutional requirement. 
""If Turnbull can get to 50-50, I would not be surprised to see an early election,"" said Haydon Manning, a political science professor at Flinders University in South Australia.
The government must head back to the polls by May 2019.
Ten lawmakers have so far been forced from office after falling foul of Australia's constitution that prohibits dual nationals from elected office, a rule that briefly forced Turnbull to govern in minority form. Several more remain under pressure to answer questions around their eligibility.
Despite the upturn in support for Turnbull, the government has now recorded 26 consecutive polls showing Labor will win a decisive victory at the next election. 
Turnbull now faces the embarrassing prospect of surpassing the 30 consecutive losing polls that he said justified his ousting of former leader Tony Abbott in September 2015.
Abbott offered little support to his long-time rival as parliament resumed for the first sitting day of 2018.
""The next election is winnable for the coalition provided we sharpen up the policy difference with Labor,"" Abbott told 2GB radio.

Income tax cuts are likely to form the centerpiece of Turnbull's plan to win favor with the electorate, but with a large budget deficit the government is left with only a few fiscal tools to win over disillusioned voters.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Russian jets intensified their raids on rebel-held towns and cities in Syria's northern Idlib province on Sunday night, a day after rebels shot down a Russian warplane and killed its pilot.
Civil defense sources said air raids struck the towns of Kafr Nubl and Maasran, as well as the cities of Saraqeb, Maarat al Numan and Idlib, and that several deaths and dozens of injuries were reported as rescuers dug through the rubble.
A hospital was hit in Maarat al Numan, witnesses and residents said, and at least five people were feared killed in another attack that damaged a residential building in Kafr Nubl.
Video recorded by rescuers showed babies on stretchers being rushed by civil defense workers out of the damaged hospital while other rescuers fought to extinguish a fire.
In Idlib city, the provincial capital, one witness said a five-storey building was leveled and that at least fifteen people were feared dead.
In December, the Syrian army alongside Iranian-backed militias and heavy Russian airpower launched a major offensive to take territory in Idlib province, the last and most-densely populated province still mainly under opposition control.
Russia's defense ministry and Syrian rebels said the Russian SU-25 jet was downed on Saturday in an area that has seen fierce fighting on the ground and heavy air strikes targeting rebel groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
Syrians who oppose Assad view Russia as an invading force and blame it for the deaths of thousands of civilians since Moscow joined the war on the Syrian government's side in 2015.
Russia's Defence Ministry denies aiming at civilians and says it targets only hardline Islamist militants in Syria.
Air strikes on Saturday after the downing of the jet killed at least 10 people, including children, in Khan al Subl near where the plane crashed, rescuers said. The bodies of a family of seven were pulled from rubble following another attack in the town of Maasran, a local civil defense body said.
""We are pulling bodies from under collapsed walls. The Russians are taking their revenge on civilians, many of whom were already displaced and had fled their homes from earlier bombardment,"" said Ahmad Hilal, a civil defense rescuer.
The Syrian army and its Iranian Shi'ite militias allies made a string of gains in the last week after capturing a major air base that brought them just 12 kms (7.5 miles) from Saraqeb, the first heavily populated city in Idlib within their reach.
They were pushing towards the main Damascus-Aleppo highway, the capture of which would cut rebel supply lines and open the door to an army advance into the heart of the province.
On Sunday, rebels led by the militant Turkestan group waged a counter attack against the Syrian army and Iranian backed militias near the Abu Duhur air base in southern Idlib.
The bombardment from the sky and fears of revenge by advancing Syrian troops and Iranian-backed militias have led to an exodus of tens of thousands of civilians further north to the safety of makeshift camps on the Syrian side of the Turkish border.
Syrians have poured into Idlib at an accelerating rate over the last two years, forced to abandon their homes in other parts of Syria that the government and its foreign military allies have recaptured from rebels.

The United Nations and aid workers have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe if the fighting nears the province's most heavily populated areas, where some two to three million people live.

119,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2018 05:05PM ET</span>",German coalition talks to continue on Monday and focus on health and labor,"By Michelle Martin and Andreas Rinke
BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) failed to conclude coalition negotiations in time to meet a self-imposed Sunday deadline but have made progress and will reconvene on Monday, SPD members said.
More than four months after a national election, Europe's largest economy and pre-eminent power-broker is in political paralysis, causing concern among investors and partner countries that policymaking on issues such as Britain's looming departure from the European Union and euro zone reform may be held up.
The conservatives and SPD had hoped to agree on Sunday to renew the ""grand coalition"" that has governed Germany since 2013, but disputes over healthcare and labor policy remain.
""We had a very constructive day today and we reached a lot of agreements,"" said SPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil, pointing to deals on rents and real estate, digitalization and culture. He said negotiators agreed to talk again on Monday ""in detail and in a focused way"" about several contentious issues.
Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller, another SPD negotiator, told German broadcaster ZDF the overall package still needed to be assessed, but he was heartened by an agreement to protect renters against excessive increases in rental costs.
""We have a basis that is getting better day by day,"" he said. 
The SPD, stung by its worst post-war result in September elections, is struggling to extract concessions that will convince its 443,000 members to approve another tie-up with conservatives. 
CDU deputy Thomas Strobl told ZDF he expected the parties to reach an agreement. ""We need a bit more time,"" he said.
Asked if the negotiations could still fail, senior conservative Reiner Haseloff told broadcaster ARD: ""I don't think so. I hope not. I can't think of any topic that is insurmountable.""
Merkel, in office for 12 years, had said earlier on Sunday that her conservatives faced tough negotiations with the SPD, adding: ""We did good groundwork yesterday but there are still important issues that need to be resolved.""
PROGRESS
The parties agreed on Sunday to invest more than 2 billion euros in social housing by 2021, to spend up to 12 billion euros on expanding broadband and to channel 33 billion euros to municipalities for various projects including childcare.
They have ticked off migration, energy and agriculture in recent days too but the most contentious issues -- labor rules and healthcare -- have yet to be resolved. 
As he arrived for talks, SPD leader Martin Schulz said the sides had edged closer on many issues but were still clashing over the SPD's bid to bar employers from imposing short-term employment contracts without justification. The two sides are also still at odds over the SPD's call to replace Germany's dual public-private healthcare system with one system for all.
The SPD sees progress on the two issues as crucial to persuade left-wing members of the party and others who want to avoid another awkward partnership with Merkel.
""I think agreements are possible but they still haven't been reached,"" Schulz said. ""Ultimately it's necessary to take the time you need to create a stable foundation for a stable government.""
The conservatives have rejected SPD calls for sweeping reform of health insurance and talks are now expected to focus on improving public healthcare, such as by changing billing rules for doctors, who earn more by treating private patients.
In labor market policy, Merkel's bloc does not want to ban fixed-term contracts, but has offered to prevent the repeated renewal of such short-term employment contracts as a compromise.
Tradeoffs are still being made. Negotiators had agreed last week to gradually abolish Germany's air transport tax but the proposal could still be dropped from the final agreement, a source familiar with the talks said late on Sunday.

SPD negotiator Manuela Schwesig, aware of the need to push through distinctive SPD policies to sell the deal to the party at large, said: ""We've promised our members that we'll negotiate until the other side squeals, and we'll do that.""

The two lower house seats were won by the conservative Republicans party, in a boost for its new leader, Laurent Wauquiez, a hard-hitting critic of Macron. Wauquiez dismisses Macron as out of touch with rural France and weak on security.
Macron, whose pro-Europe, pro-business Republic On The Move party still controls 309 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, has seen his popularity wane since he took power.
""It's a blow which severely punishes the government's policies whose impact on the ground is being judged harshly by our fellow citizens: tax rises for the middle class and pensioners and an unprecedented explosion in immigration and crime,"" Wauquiez said in a statement.
One of the conservatives was reelected in the Belfort 1 constituency in the east of the country with 58.93 percent of the votes, against 41.07 percent for the candidate supported by Macron's party.
Other parties, including the far-right National Front, were eliminated in the first round last Sunday.
The second seat in the running in the Val d'Oise area north of Paris was lost by Macron's candidate, who conceded defeat to her conservative rival late on Sunday. Final results were not yet available.

The by-elections were triggered after France's constitutional court declared last year's results invalid.

Jerusalem is home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions, and Trump's recent announcement that he would move the U.S. embassy to the city alarmed many allies, who say the decision could doom Middle East peace efforts.
Erdogan previously clashed with the pope when Francis, in 2015, became the first head of the Roman Catholic Church to publicly call the 1915 killing of as many as 1.5 million Armenians ""genocide"" -- something Turkey has always denied.
But the two men have found common ground over Jerusalem, speaking by phone after Trump made his announcement in December and agreeing that any change to the city's status should be avoided.
Before leaving Turkey, Erdogan said the United States had isolated itself over Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want to share with the Israelis as their future capital.
""In the process ahead, come on and accept Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine. This is the point that is to be reached. We are now working for this,"" he told reporters in Istanbul. 
Erdogan is due to see the pope on Monday in what will be the first visit to the Vatican by a Turkish president in 59 years.
The two men are also expected to discuss the situation in Syria and Iraq as well as humanitarian aid and refugees. 
Turkey last month sent troops into neighboring Syria to attack Kurdish YPG fighters near its southern border. Turkey sees the militia as a terrorist group and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and has shrugged off criticism at home and abroad over the operation.
Demonstrations are expected in Rome to mark Erdogan's visit and some 3,500 police and security forces will be on duty. In an interview with La Stampa newspaper, Erdogan dismissed the likely protests.
""I don’t speak to people who support terrorism. I only speak to those who fight it,"" he was quoted as saying.
The Turkish leader is also due to meet Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni on Monday, as well as local business leaders.

""You are only 11th when it comes to the number of foreign companies active in Turkey, we need to improve that,"" he told La Stampa.

NICOSIA (Reuters) - Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades won a second five-year term on Sunday as voters gave a thumbs-up to his record in containing an economic meltdown in 2013 and conducting abortive peace talks with the Turkish Cypriots.
With all votes counted, the conservative had 56 percent of the vote against 44 percent for the leftist-backed Stavros Malas.
Anastasiades, 71, steered the Cypriot economy to recovery after it was plunged into crisis in 2013, days after he was first elected, by its exposure to debt-racked Greece and by fiscal slippage under a previous left-wing administration.
Cyprus emerged from a bailout program from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund in 2016. Unlike other austerity programs, the Cyprus model put most of the painful measures up front, including recapitalizing banks by seizing uninsured deposits, a so-called 'bail-in' - used in the euro zone for the first time.
Malas, a geneticist who served as health minister in the former leftist administration, had also come second to Anastasiades in 2013.
Political analyst Hubert Faustmann said Anastasiades had entered the race as favorite in a field of relatively uninspiring candidates, adding: ""He handled the economic crisis very well, he got a lot of credit for that.""
As leader of the island's Greek Cypriot community, Anastasiades also oversaw peace talks with the breakaway Turkish-Cypriot controlled north. 
Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup, and has one of the world's longest-serving peacekeeping forces.
Peace talks collapsed last year over the role that Turkey could play in a post-settlement Cyprus. 
Anastasiades faced criticism from Greek Cypriots both for offering too many concessions and for missing one of the best chances in a generation to solve the logjam.

""There are two narratives in the Greek Cypriot community: one that he bears responsibility for the failure of talks and the other - that Turkish intransigence is responsible. It's apparently the second which prevailed,"" Faustmann said.

CAYCE, S.C. (Reuters) - An Amtrak passenger train apparently traveling on the wrong track collided with a parked freight train in South Carolina on Sunday, killing two crew members and injuring at least 116 other people in the railroad's third fatal crash in as many months, authorities said.
Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were in Cayce, South Carolina, where Amtrak Train 91, carrying 139 passengers and eight crew to Miami from New York, hit the CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX) freight train at about 2:35 a.m. local time (0735 GMT) and derailed near the state capital Columbia.
Amtrak engineer Michael Kempf, 54, of Savannah, Georgia, and conductor Michael Cella, 36, of Orange Park, Florida, were killed, Lexington County Coroner Margaret Fisher told reporters at a news conference. Autopsies were underway, she said.
Two of the 116 people injured were in critical condition, authorities said.
""It appears Amtrak was on the wrong track,"" South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster told reporters. He said the freight train, which had no one aboard, ""was on the track it was supposed to be on."" 
The area has three rows of tracks, and the freight train was parked on a ""loading track or a side track"" and ""not the main track,"" McMaster said.
""It's a horrible thing to see, to understand what force was involved,"" he said. ""The first engine of the freight train was torn up, and the single engine of the passenger train is barely recognizable.""
Amtrak said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the deaths. It said CSX owns and maintains the area where the crash occurred. 
""CSX controls the dispatching of all trains, including directing the signal systems which control access to sidings and yards,"" Amtrak said in a statement.
The southbound passenger train's locomotive was lying on its side, and the first car was bent and also derailed, although it remained upright, images from the scene showed. 
At least four cars of the freight train, which was northbound before it was parked, were crumpled, looking like crushed tin foil, but remained on the tracks.
The passenger train was part of Amtrak' Silver Star Service, and the wreck occurred about 5 miles (8 km) southwest of Columbia. Officials said some 5,000 gallons of fuel leaked as a result of the collision, but it was under control and no threat to public safety.
U.S. President Donald Trump was getting regular updates on the crash while at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. ""My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina,"" he tweeted. ""Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work they've done!""
McMaster said he had been told the Amtrak train was traveling at about 59 miles (95 km) per hour upon impact. The NTSB investigation will seek to confirm its speed. 
In December, three people were killed when an Amtrak passenger train derailed in Washington state. The engineer later told the NTSB he had misread a signal and tried to brake before the accident. 
In late January, an Amtrak train carrying Republican members of the U.S. Congress killed one person in a garbage truck with which it collided in Virginia.
A Federal Railroad Administration Investigative team was also in Cayce to help establish what happened. 

""It is important to understand the factors that contributed to this tragic accident and how all stakeholders can ensure a safe and reliable rail system going forward,"" the U.S. Department of Transportation said in a statement.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the decision to retroactively authorize the 50-family outpost of Havat Gilad was meant to ""allow the continuation of normal life there"".
Most countries deem Israeli settlements in the West Bank, land that Israel captured in a 1967 war and which Palestinians want for a future state, to be illegal. Israel disputes this.
The decision was approved unanimously by Israel's cabinet.
Palestinian officials condemned the move and said it seemed to be the result of a change in U.S. policy toward Israel.
President Donald Trump in December recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, breaking with decades of U.S. policy that the city’s status must be decided in peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
East Jerusalem was captured by Israel in a 1967 war, and Palestinians want it for the capital of a future state. 
""Netanyahu is trying to make facts on ground. All settlements in the West Bank, including in Jerusalem, are illegal,"" said Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's executive committee.

On Jan. 9, Havat Gilad resident Rabbi Raziel Shevah was shot dead from a passing vehicle as he drove near his home.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of Greeks rallied outside parliament in Athens on Sunday to protest against the use of the term Macedonia in any settlement the government pursues with the ex-Yugoslav Republic to end a decades-old name row.
The two countries have agreed to step up negotiations, mediated by the United Nations, this year to settle the dispute, which has frustrated the aspirations of Greece's small northern neighbor to join NATO and the European Union. 
Thoroughfares in central Athens turned into a sea of people waving blue and white Greek flags in what locals said was the largest gathering in decades, easily outdoing rallies against austerity foisted by lenders on the crisis-hit country.
Greece objects to Macedonia's name because it has its own region called Macedonia, and argues that its neighbor's use of the name, along with contentious articles in its constitution, imply territorial claims over Greek land.
Protesters hoisted a giant Greek flag over the demonstration with a crane on Sunday. They held banners reading ""Hands off Macedonia!"" and chanted the national anthem.
""I'm here for Macedonia. Macedonia is ours, it's part of Greece. We won't let them take it from us,"" said 72-year old Persefoni Platsouri clutching a Greek flag.
The case evokes strong emotions among Greeks who consider Macedonia, the ancient kingdom ruled by Alexander the Great, to be an integral part of their homeland and heritage. 
Talks also reopened at a sensitive time for a country which is struggling to emerge from its worst debt crisis in decades and to regain sovereignty over economic policy-making after years of austerity mandated by international lenders.
""HISTORICAL LIE""
Among Sunday's speakers was world-renowned Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis, who said the eight-year economic crisis had not wiped Greece's history from people's memories. 
""If we give in, we are leaving the doors wide open for a tragic historical lie to come through and stay forever,"" the 93-year old leftist, a symbol of resistance against the 1967-1974 military junta, told a cheering crowd.
Talks between the two countries have been inconclusive since the Balkan state broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991. 
Due to Greece's objections, Macedonia was admitted to the United Nations with the provisional name ""The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"" in 1993, which remains its official title in international organizations. A majority of countries in the world refer to it simply as Macedonia. 
Greece's leftist-led government has proposed a compound name, with a geographical qualifier, which would be the only name that could be used for the country.
But opinion polls in recent weeks have shown a majority of Greeks oppose the use of ""Macedonia"" in any solution. About 300,000 people turned out at a demonstration on Jan. 21 in Thessaloniki, capital of Greece's Macedonia region.
The issue has also strained relations between Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' Syriza party and his small coalition ally, the right-wing Independent Greeks. The coalition government controls 154 seats in the 300-seat parliament. 
The Macedonia issue helped bring down Greece's conservative government in 1993; the same party, now in opposition, has criticized Tsipras' administration for its negotiating tactics.
Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias said last week that Greece is preparing proposals which would be the basis of negotiations for a settlement with its neighboring country.

""Here are the borders. This is Macedonia ... Macedonia is Greek, no one can take this name, no one can use it,"" said protester Rania Mainou, pointing on a map.

DAKAR/MUMBAI (Reuters) - A ship carrying 22 Indian crew and 13,500 tons of gasoline is missing in the Gulf of Guinea after contact was lost in Benin on Friday, the company and India's minister of external affairs said on Sunday.
The Gulf of Guinea has become an increasing target for pirates who steal cargo and demand ransoms, even as piracy incidents fall worldwide, experts say.
The Marine Express tanker, managed by Hong Kong-based Anglo-Eastern, was last see in Benin's waters at 3:30 a.m. GMT on Friday after which contact was lost, an Anglo Eastern spokesman told Reuters.
The cause of the loss of communication was unknown and a search was underway, conducted with help from Nigerian and Beninese authorities, Anglo-Eastern said. 
""We regret that contact has been lost with the vessel, which was the Cotonou Anchorage in Benin, West Africa,"" the spokesman said. 
India's minister of external affairs Sushma Swaraj said on Twitter that 22 Indian nationals were onboard. 
Piracy-related issues were a decade ago focused off the east African coast, particularly Somalia's unpoliced waters. But the Gulf of Guinea threat has increased. 
Ships in the area were the target of a series of piracy-related incidents last year, according to a January report by the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), which highlighted the waters off West Africa as an area of growing concern. 
There were ten incidents of kidnapping involving 65 crew members in or around Nigerian waters, the IMB said. Globally 16 vessels reported being fired upon, seven of which were in the Gulf of Guinea.
On Jan. 10 a company lost communication with its tanker anchored in Cotonou, according to the IMB. After a six-day search, the tanker and crew were found safely in Lagos after the tanker owner negotiated with the hijackers, IMB said.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israeli judges ruled on Sunday that a Jewish settler killed by a Palestinian with whom she was in a relationship was the victim of a political attack rather than a personal one.
Michal Halimi, 29, who was two months pregnant at the time of her death, went missing last May. Her body was discovered outside Tel Aviv in August, and Israeli police arrested Mohammed Harouf, a Palestinian.
Harouf, 30, said in a televised statement to the court in August that he had targeted Halimi “to free prisoners”. His lawyer, Elad Rath, said that Harouf's plan had been to abduct Halimi and swap her for Palestinians held in Israeli jails, but that when she resisted he strangled and bludgeoned her to death.
    Halimi was married and lived in the settlement of Adam in the occupied West Bank. Harouf, from Nablus, was working as a gardener in Holon, south of Tel Aviv, on the day of the murder.
    Israeli prosecutors initially treated the case as non-political. Israeli media reprinted a photograph that had circulated on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) of Halimi and Harouf embracing and smiling. 
    But on Sunday, prosecutors agreed to a plea bargain under which Harouf will serve a life sentence for murder.
The amended indictment said Harouf had been in a ""personal relationship"" with Halimi but that he had attacked her ""out of nationalistic motives, as she was Jewish"", in effect designating him as a Palestinian militant. 
    This means that Halimi’s next-of-kin will be entitled to state stipends given to relatives left bereaved by political violence. 
    Harouf's family, in turn, can expect payouts from the Palestinian Authority, which offers such support to relatives of those killed or jailed for attacks on Israelis. Those Palestinian stipends have come under increased scrutiny by Israel and have drawn U.S. threats of funding cuts.
    ""This arrangement is important not least because it spares the (victim's) family further grief,"" lead prosecutor Raed Anuz told the three-judge panel.

No date was set for the sentencing.

Israeli authorities say such demolitions carry out court rulings against unauthorized building by Palestinians. Palestinians see it as part of a broader move to seize land for potential Jewish settlement expansion.
The two classrooms, which stood separately from the rest of the hilltop school, were demolished early in the morning by a work crew while Israeli security officers closed off the area, according to residents of the Palestinian village Abu Nuwar.
Tens of thousands of Bedouin, once nomads, live in villages across the desert region of southern Israel and in the West Bank.
It was the fifth time the school has been demolished since 2016, Palestinian officials said. Residents, with the help of non-government organizations and E.U. funding, reconstruct it each time.
""The building was built illegally and without the necessary permits. In addition, the enforcement was approved by the Supreme Court,"" said a statement from Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, the military-run authority that deals with Palestinian civilian issues.
Shadi Othman, head of media in the E.U. office in Jerusalem, said: ""The European Union demanded from Israel more than once not to demolish projects the European Union funds and which aim to improve the living conditions of the Palestinians.""
Senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said on Twitter the demolition was ""the continuation of Israel's humiliation of international law and only aims to break the Palestinian will for freedom and life.""

Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi told judiciary news website Mizan that the convicted person had met nine times with U.S. and European agents to hand over information ""about sanctions and nuclear matters"" and had received unspecified sums of money in return. 
""This person has been sentenced to six years imprisonment and the return and seizure of funds,"" Dolatabadi said.
In December, Dolatabadi said Iran's Supreme Court had upheld a death sentence against Ahmadreza Djalali, a Sweden-based Iranian academic convicted of providing information to Israel to help it assassinate several senior nuclear scientists.
At least four scientists were killed between 2010 and 2012 in what Tehran said were assassinations meant to sabotage its efforts to develop nuclear energy. 
Western powers and Israel said Iran aimed to build a nuclear bomb, which Tehran denied.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - American DJ and record producer Diplo brought his Mad Decent Block Party to Pakistan's capital over the weekend, headlining a roster of musicians including local Pakistani acts.
For two-time Grammy winner Diplo, playing Pakistan is a way to foster good relations with the mostly Muslim country after an angry Jan. 1 tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump complaining that Pakistan gives ""terrorists"" a safe haven.
""I think the best way we can do any kind of diplomacy with the Pakistani people is ... basically reaching out to the kids like we do at the concerts,"" Diplo told TMZ last month after the Trump tweet, which soured U.S.-Pakistani relations.
He added that by having U.S. acts connect with the large youth population - an estimated 60 percent of Pakistanis are under age 30 - ""they can grow into being our allies"".
More than 2,500 young people crowded into an outdoor venue in the capital, Islamabad, to a scaled down version of the event known for bringing together some of the hottest names in dance-hall, hip hop and electronic music.
Among the headliners were Diplo's chart-topping side project Major Lazer Soundsystem, DJ Chrome Sparks and Pakistani duo SNKM, which has played the South by Southwest festival and toured with Diplo in the U.S.

""There's a lot of bridges being built between here and the U.S."" says SNKM's Adil Omar, who also has a successful hip hop career and a new album and film ""Transcendence"" to be released this year.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The six most powerful officials in South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) will meet President Jacob Zuma on Sunday, a senior party leader said, amid growing pressure for the 75-year old leader to step down. 
Zuma, who is battling corruption allegations, has been in a weakened position since he was replaced as leader of the ANC in December by Cyril Ramaphosa, the deputy president.
The party's ""top-six"" leadership team is due to meet Zuma later on Sunday, party secretary-general and top-six member Ace Magashule told local media including news channel eNCA and the City Press newspaper. 
Magashule said that the removal of Zuma as president of the country was not on the agenda, differing with reports citing unnamed sources in the City Press and Sunday Times newspapers that the leaders would ask the president to resign. 
There was no immediate comment from an ANC spokeswoman.
Ramaphosa is in pole position to win an election next year and many in the party want Zuma out so that Ramaphosa can embark on his anti-corruption agenda. 
It was unclear if Ramaphosa would be at the meeting which the Sunday Times said was due to held in Pretoria. The ANC leader was in the northern province of Limpopo to urge traditional leaders to support the party in next year's election. 
In public remarks at the event, Ramaphosa did not say if he would be part of the meeting with Zuma, who has been deserted by several prominent allies in the ANC since Ramaphosa took leadership of what is the only party to govern South Africa since the end of apartheid. 
Paul Mashatile, a top-six member, told CNBC Africa on Friday the president should step down to avoid two centers of power and his removal via a motion of no-confidence or impeachment.
""It's really anyone's guess as to what will come out of the meeting but Zuma's days in the office can definitely be counted in weeks, not months,"" said Jakkie Cilliers, an analyst with the Institute for Security Studies, a Pretoria-based think tank.
Zuma, who has not said whether he will step down voluntarily before his second term as president ends, has been deserted by several prominent allies in the ANC since Ramaphosa took over leadership of what is the only party to govern South Africa since the end of apartheid. 
He is due to deliver a speech at the opening of parliament in Cape Town on Thursday, Magashule told eNCA news channel on Sunday. 
It is unclear if he would still be office to face a fresh no-confidence motion on Feb. 22.

Zuma has survived several no-confidence votes during his rule thanks to loyal voting by ANC lawmakers, who form a strong parliamentary majority. Although Zuma retains the support of a faction within the ANC, he no longer holds a top post.

The review of U.S. nuclear policy published on Friday has riled Russia, which viewed the document as confrontational, and raised fears that it could increase the risk of miscalculation between the two world powers.
""The Americans are shamelessly threatening Russia with a new atomic weapon,"" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist who opened the way to Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers including longtime adversary Washington, said in a speech.
""The same people who supposedly believe that using weapons of mass destruction is a crime against humanity ... are talking about new weapons to threaten or use against rivals,"" he said in his televised address.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif earlier warned in a tweet that the U.S. policy document posed the risk of ""bringing humankind closer to annihilation"". 
The U.S. military has put countering China and Russia, dubbed ""revisionist powers"", at the centre of a new national defence strategy unveiled earlier this month shifting priorities away from fighting Islamist militants.
By expanding its own low-yield nuclear capability, the United States would deter Russia from using nuclear weapons, according to American officials.
Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday it was very disappointed by the content of the document, which, it said, has a confrontational feel and anti-Russian orientation.
German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said the U.S. decision showed ""the spiral of a new nuclear arms race is already under way"" and added that Europe was, much like during the Cold War, especially vulnerable.
""That's why we need to start new initiatives in Europe for arms control and disarmament,"" Gabriel said in a statement, adding that developing new weapons sent the wrong message and risked triggering an arms race.
Zarif also said in his tweet: ""(U.S. President Donald)Trump's obduracy in killing the #JCPOA (Iran's nuclear deal with world powers) stems from the same dangerous imprudence"".
Trump gave the Iran nuclear deal, negotiated before he took office, a final reprieve last month but warned European allies and Congress they had to work with him to fix ""the disastrous flaws"" in the pact or face a U.S. exit.
He said he would waive sanctions against Iran that were lifted as part of the international deal for the last time unless his conditions were met.

The ultimatum put pressure on European Union powers - key backers and parties to the 2015 international agreement to curb Iran's nuclear programme – to satisfy Trump, who wants the pact strengthened with a separate agreement.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will not ""surrender"" in its fight to win a bespoke deal with the European Union that would offer tariff-free trade as well as control over immigration, a minister said on Sunday before a crunch week for the government in Brexit negotiations.
Interior minister Amber Rudd was one of several senior Conservative lawmakers to take to the airwaves to support Prime Minister Theresa May, under pressure from Brexit hardliners who fear she is diluting her plans for a clean break with the EU.
With reports in the local media suggesting that pro-Brexit ministers are being urged to get ready to replace May, Rudd tried to play down the deep divisions in government, saying there was more unity than so-called Brexiteers thought.
""We want to have a bespoke agreement. Now we're not going to surrender before we have that battle,"" Rudd told the BBC when asked whether ministers were pursuing what the EU has already ruled out as ""having its cake and eating it"" - demanding tariff-free access to the EU's market while controlling immigration.
She also told the Andrew Marr Show she supported May in demanding that EU citizens arriving after Brexit Day in March 2019 should have settlement rights different to those who came before that date - something the EU has opposed.
Asked whether Brexit campaigners were right to say that some in her cabinet were trying to blunt prospects for a wholesale departure from with the EU, Rudd said: ""I have a surprise for the Brexiteers, which is the committee that meets in order to help make these decisions ... is more united than they think.""
Her words come at the beginning of a week when the government will flesh out some of its demands in negotiations with the EU on their future relationship and Brexit negotiations start in earnest again.
The government's Brexit sub-committee of ministers will also meet twice this week, Rudd said, adding: ""I think that we will arrive at something which suits us all.""
ANOTHER NEW ROW
Other Conservative lawmakers backed her message, with junior housing minister Dominic Raab saying there wasn't ""a fag (cigarette) paper"" between ministers on their stance on the future relationship. 
But the choreographed display of unity did little to mask a growing dispute over a leaked document suggesting the economy will be worse off after Brexit whether Britain left with a free trade deal, with access to the EU's single market, or with no deal at all.
The leak, which bolstered arguments from some lawmakers to stay in the EU's customs union to protect the economy, prompted allegations from Brexit campaigners that the civil service was trying to undermine Britain's departure.
A former head of the civil service, Gus O'Donnell, said the allegations were unfounded and offered up by those who did not like what they heard.

""If you're selling snake oil, you don't like the idea of experts testing your product,"" he told ITV's Peston on Sunday. ""And I think that's what we've got - this backlash against evidence and experts is because they know where the experts will go.""

135,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",Yemen Islamist party suspends membership of Nobel laureate Karman,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemeni Nobel Prize winner Tawakkol Karman was suspended from an Islamist party allied with President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after she accused the Saudi-led coalition that backs him in the country's civil war of acting as occupiers.
Karman won the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize for her role in Arab Spring protests that ousted authoritarian President Ali Abdullah. More recently she has ramped up public criticism of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, accusing them of backing a campaign to divide Yemen by supporting southern separatists against the internationally recognized government.
Speaking at the Warwick Economics Summit in London over the weekend, Karman said Saudi Arabia and the UAE were driven by a ""reckless adventurism"" when they intervened in Yemen in 2015 after Iran-aligned Houthi forces drove Hadi into exile.
In an earlier Twitter message, she wrote: ""Saudi Arabia and UAE took advantage of the (Houthi) militia coup in Sanaa to launch a very ugly occupation and an uglier influence in Yemen.""
The Islah party, regarded as a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is viewed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE as a terrorist organization, tried to distance itself from Karman and order her suspended from its ranks.
""Tawakkol Karman's statements do not represent the Islah party and its policies, and are not in line with the party's positions,"" a statement posted on Islah's website said. 
""Therefore, the general secretary has decided to freeze her membership according to the party's status."" 
Karman, who left Yemen after Houthi militia seized the capital Sanaa in a series of military advances that began in late 2014, responded on her Twitter account by describing Islah leaders as ""prisoners and slaves"" of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. 
Tensions between Islah and southern separatists have been rising since Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, announced a boycott of Qatar in June last year over allegations that Doha backs Islamist militants. Qatar denies the charges. 
Islah, eager to ease the worries of Gulf Arab states about its Islamist leanings, has sought to distance itself from the Muslim Brotherhood.
The Brotherhood denies accusations from conservative Arab governments of involvement in terrorism, saying it seeks democracy by peaceful means only.

The southern separatists want to restore the independent state of South Yemen, which merged with North Yemen in 1990. They have fought the Houthis alongside Hadi's forces, but rose up last week and seized control of the southern port of Aden after Hadi refused to sack his prime minister, whom the separatists accuse of mismanagement and corruption.

136,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2018 06:46AM ET</span>",Maldives top court seeks to impeach president: attorney general,"By Mohamed Junayd
MALE (Reuters) - The Supreme Court in the Maldives is trying to impeach President Abdulla Yameen for not obeying its order to release jailed opposition leaders, the attorney general said on Sunday, warning of further instability in the Indian Ocean nation.
The Maldives, best known for its luxury resorts, has been in a political crisis since the top court threw out terrorism convictions last week against former president Mohamed Nasheed and others who have been trying to oust the president for years. 
Yameen has faced calls at home, and from the United States and India, among other nations, to heed the court decision on Nasheed, the island's first democratically elected president, and the others, but so far has dug in his heels. 
Home to about 400,000 people, the Maldives has also been drawn into a regionwide tussle for influence between India - with which it has longstanding political and security ties - and China, which opened an embassy in 2011 and has offered technical and financial assistance to build infrastructure. 
Attorney General Mohamed Anil said the government had received information the Supreme Court was preparing to fire Yameen, but such a move would be illegal and resisted by government law enforcement authorities. 
""We have received information that things might happen that will lead to a national security crisis,"" Anil told reporters in the capital, Male.
""The information says the Supreme Court might issue a ruling to impeach or remove the president from power,"" he said, adding that government bodies had been given instructions not to carry out such an order. 
Meanwhile, Parliament Secretary General Ahmed Mohamed, who is politically neutral, suddenly resigned on Sunday, citing personal reasons a day before the opening session of the body.
Mohamed had told Reuters he would abide by a separate Supreme Court ruling ordering the reinstatement of 12 legislators who defected from Yameen's ruling party last year. Allowing them to return to the legislature would deprive him of a majority.
More than 100 riot police stood guard outside government offices in Male, including Parliament, as well as at Republic Square (NYSE:SQ), a site of protests by opposition activists, although the streets were quiet. 
The combined opposition said it feared a military takeover of the islands to preserve Yameen's grip on power. 
""The intimidation of the Supreme Court justices, with the highly irregular statement made by the attorney general defying the Supreme Court, supported by the two chiefs of the security forces, is tantamount to the effective sidelining of the judiciary and in direct contravention of the constitution,"" it said in a statement.
""Maldivians are fearful that President Yameen is about to order a full military takeover of the country, in an attempt to ensure he is not removed from office.""
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
The crisis poses the biggest threat to Yameen's control of the Maldives since he took power in 2013, defeating Nasheed in an election which the latter's supporters said was rigged.
Yameen has stopped short of saying he will not obey the court order. He told a party meeting on Saturday he ""did not expect the Supreme Court ruling at all"".
Critics of the government continued to face pressure. On Sunday, police raided the home of Hassan Saeed, the head of the judicial administration department, which the opposition said was considering a corruption investigation into Yameen. 
Police said in a statement they were looking to arrest Saeed over an investigation into apartment purchases. 
They were also inquiring about whether family members of Supreme Court Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and Supreme Court Justice Ali Hameed, who handed down last week's ruling, were involved in the apartment purchases, police said.
Yameen's senior ruling party members also called on authorities to shut down independent TV channel Raajje TV saying it was spreading discord. 
In response, the U.S. Embassy in Colombo, Sri Lanka, issued a tweet to say it was ""dismayed to hear rumours"" about a potential shutdown, and calling it ""yet another blow"" to freedom of the press.
The political drama in the Maldives, which is made up of 26 coral atolls and 1,192 individual islands, centres on tiny, densely populated Male, the base of all its major institutions.
Besides political wrangling, the largely Muslim island chain is grappling with problems such as significant numbers of radicalised youth who enlisted to fight for the Islamic State militant group in the Middle East.

Yameen on Saturday fired his second police chief in three days.

Francis, speaking to tens of thousands of people in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) for his weekly blessing, said he was making the appeal because of the ""tragic prolonging"" of conflicts around the world.
Feb. 23 is a Friday in the first full week of the Christian season of Lent, during which fasting from food and extra acts of charity are encouraged as a sign of penitence.
He said ""everyone, in their own consciences, before God, should ask 'what can I do for peace?'""
""Surely, we can pray but not only: each one of us can say 'no' to violence in their own way, because victories obtained through violence are false victories, while working for peace benefits all,"" he said.
He specifically invited non-Catholics and non-Christians to join the initiative in any way they saw fit, ""but all together"".
Francis said the prayers and fasting should be offered in a particular way for the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan.

South Sudan has been hit by a prolonged civil war and humanitarian crisis. The Democratic Republic of Congo has been hit by unrest this month following the shooting of protesting pro-democracy churchgoers opposed to President Joseph Kabila.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan's long-delayed parliamentary and local council elections scheduled for July this year may have to be pushed back for another three months, an election commissioner said on Sunday citing organizational challenges.
The parliamentary polls, originally scheduled for July 2015, are seen as dry run for a presidential election in mid-2019 and a test of the progress made by Afghanistan's Western-backed government towards establishing durable democratic institutions.
""We are ready to hold the elections with two or three months' delay, but the security agencies must tell us whether they are ready,"" Wasima Badghisi, deputy head of operations at the Independent Election Commission told Reuters.
The problems in organizing the parliamentary vote underline the fragility of the political institutions created in Afghanistan since a U.S.-led campaign brought down the Taliban in 2001.
International donor countries have laid heavy emphasis on the need for successful elections this year following a contentious presidential election in 2014 that was marred by allegations of massive voter fraud on both sides.
Referring to organizational problems, Badghisi said the appointment of a new member of the election commission had taken a lot of time, she also cited budget problems and insecurity.
Afghanistan has held two parliamentary elections since the end of Taliban rule, the first in 2005 and the second in 2010.
The five-year term of the parliament elected in 2010 was meant to expire in June 2015, but elections were postponed because of security fears and disagreements on how to ensure a fair vote after the bitterly disputed presidential election in 2014.
The current assembly is operating under a 2015 decree issued by President Ashraf Ghani extending parliament’s mandate until a vote could be held, a decision criticized by many Afghans who questioned whether the extension was legal.
District council elections have never been held, despite being mandated in the 2004 constitution.
Late last year, officials from international partners including the United Nations told the government that even under the most favorable conditions, the earliest date on which an election could feasibly be held was October 2018.
Many Western diplomats believe even that date is impossible.
If not ready by autumn this year, Afghanistan's mountainous terrain, bad roads and lack of security mean that registering voters and setting up balloting stations are likely to face severe delays over the winter, pushing the election into 2019.
The 2014 presidential election produced no agreed winner and led to a U.S.-brokered deal which saw former rivals Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah forced into an uneasy coalition that has struggled to win popular support.

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - Neither snow nor slush nor sub-zero temperatures kept American football fans from celebrating the virtual holiday that is Super Bowl Sunday as massive crowds descended on downtown Minneapolis ahead of the big game.
The town has been gripped by a carnival atmosphere for the National Football League championship game, drawing out-of-town fans of the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles plus plenty of Minnesota natives who jammed the streets despite a snow storm on Saturday and temperatures that occasionally dipped below zero Fahrenheit (minus 18 Celsius) over the weekend.
Temperatures during the game are forecast at 1 Fahrenheit, though the players and some 66,000 spectators will be warmer inside the indoor U.S. Bank Stadium.
The entertainment included a temporary ski run, a snowmobile stunt show in which daredevils soared into the air, warming fires and a concert stage where one musician had to stop the show to warm up because of freezing hands.  
""I love the cold. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so there's no reason not to come out,"" said Devan Hunt, a 19-year-old University of Minnesota student who was waiting in line to have his picture taken inside a giant, transparent football.
There were occasional celebrity sightings, such as television's Jimmy Fallon popping up periodically, followed by gaggles of fans, their cellphone cameras raised.
Other fans took turns posing beside a statue of Mary Tyler Moore, the late actress whose eponymous show in the 1970s took place in Minneapolis.
""Why would I waste the opportunity? It could be 100 degrees and I'd still be out here,"" said high school student Stephen Zapata, 17.
Those who wanted their fun indoors paid $35 for the Super Bowl Experience inside the convention center, where fans could test their football skills by running through obstacle courses with the ball, kicking field goals or passing the ball deep into baskets.
Despite the party, some contemplated weightier matters concerning the NFL, such as the health of players suffering brain injuries or protests by players who have kneeled during the national anthem over racial inequality.
Farah Atto, 35, a day trader and Minnesota Vikings fan, said he was troubled that he enjoyed watching the game even though it may cause premature death for players. 
""It's not as much fun anymore,"" Atto said. ""Before, you were not aware of it. Now you know you're watching a dangerous game.""
Some fans waited to see whether any players from the Eagles or Patriots would kneel during the national anthem, a practice criticized by President Donald Trump.
""The stage doesn't get much bigger than this,"" said Olivia House, 20, a college student in Minneapolis who said she hoped player protests would spark more dialogue about social justice issues.
Also missing from the festivities were the city's homeless, whose routines were disrupted by the influx of out-of-town visitors and a security operation that established a perimeter around U.S. Bank Stadium.
Homeless advocates worked with local Super Bowl organizers to mitigate the impact on the homeless and educate them on the changes to come, said Gail Dorfman, an advocate for the homeless an executive director of St. Stephen's Human Services.
Dan Sherman, a 60-year-old homeless man, who was riding the train to stay warm, said he was concerned about where to go when the train would be closed on game day. 
Still, Sherman said he was enjoying the Super Bowl festivities.

""The people are in a good mood,"" he said. ""I'm in a good mood and I think that's because of the people of Minnesota.""

NICOSIA (Reuters) - Greek Cypriots headed back to the polls on Sunday in a runoff presidential vote between an incumbent conservative pledging to re-energise talks at ending the island's division, and a leftist opponent who accuses him of squandering chances of a deal.
Sunday's ballot pits President Nicos Anastasiades, 71, against leftist-backed Stavros Malas, 50. Polling stations opened at 0500 GMT with exit polls giving a first snapshot of voting when they close at 1600 GMT. Results should be final a little over two hours after voting ends.
Both candidates appealed for people to vote after a high abstention rate in the first round of 28 percent. 
""Don't give up on the right to decide who the next president will be,"" said Anastasiades. ""Our country has problems and the input of all is needed, irrespective of who will win tonight,"" he added. 
""This election process concerns us all, all those who want to know what a European and multi-cultural state actually means,"" said Malas after casting his ballot.
Anastasiades got 35.51 and Malas 30.24 percent of the vote in the first poll on Jan. 28, with the remainder cast among candidates who had taken a harder line than either in peace talks with estranged Turkish Cypriots. 
Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup, and the EU member state hosts one of the world's longest serving peacekeeping forces with Greek Cypriots in the south, and Turkish Cypriots in the north.
Peace talks collapsed last year over the role that Turkey could play in a post-settlement Cyprus. 
Anastasiades, who represented the Greek Cypriot side in those talks, faced criticism at home for either being too concessionary, or, as Malas suggests, tactical blunders in missing one of the best chances in a generation to solve the logjam.
Anastasiades denies both.
The runners-up from last week's poll have refused to endorse either candidate, unusual in Cypriot election runoffs where the intervening week between votes is normally used to forge alliances.

""The new president will have a mandate directly from the people and not one via a politician seeking a share of the spoils,"" the liberal Cyprus Mail daily wrote in an editorial, lauding the end of a 'sheep mentality' which guided voters in the past.

141,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2018 02:55AM ET</span>","It's when, not if: Singapore worries, and prepares, for militant attack","By Fathin Ungku and John Geddie
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Armed officers patrol a train station where television screens and giant posters warn of the threat from militants. Nearby, fake gunmen storm a shopping mall in one of many recent terror attack simulations.
But this is not some war-ravaged country. It is one of the safest in the world, Singapore. 
The wealthy island-state has a near-perfect record of keeping its shores free from terror, but as it prepares to host defence ministers from around Southeast Asia this week, it appears to have good reason to have prioritized stopping the spread of militancy in the region.
The cosmopolitan financial hub, which was second only to Tokyo in The Economist Intelligence Unit's Safe Cities Index in 2017, says it has been the target of militant plots for years, some stemming from its Muslim-majority neighbors, and that it's a matter of 'when' and not 'if' militants will strike.
""Singapore continues to face a serious security threat from both homegrown radicalised individuals and foreign terrorists who continue to see Singapore as a prized target,"" Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said in response to e-mailed questions from Reuters. 
Singapore authorities say they have been a target of Islamic extremism since the 1990s, but efforts to deter terrorism have stepped up markedly in recent years with more frequent attacks on Western countries and after Islamic State (IS) militants briefly took over a town in the southern Philippines last year.
Raising further concerns about the threat to the island, a Singaporean soldier has featured on a number of Islamic State promotional videos, most recently in December where he was filmed executing men alongside other militants.
In its inaugural Terrorism Threat Assessment Report released last year, the MHA said Islamic State has demonstrated that Singapore is ""very much on its radar"" and that the threat to the country remains ""the highest in recent years"" - claims that are backed up by security experts.
""Singapore, being known as safe and secure, makes it such a risk target,"" said Dan Bould, Asia director of crisis management at professional services firm Aon and a former captain in the British army. 
""If there's an attack in the Philippines, it may get half an hour in a 24-hour news cycle. An attack in Singapore with all the multicultural individuals operating here, will be within the narrative for a few days at least."" 
In early 2017, Aon lifted Singapore in the terrorism and political violence category of its annual risk map from negligible to low risk.
MOBILE APP
The reality is that Singapore has so far escaped the attacks seen in other major world cities like New York, London and Berlin in recent years. That's why it is at the bottom of the 2017 Global Terror Index, with no reported terror-related attacks post 9/11.
But three in four Singaporeans believe that it's only a matter of time before the country experiences a terror attack, a poll by the local newspaper Sunday Times last year showed.
Singapore authorities certainly do not want their citizens to be complacent. Everyone, including school children, is encouraged to download a mobile app that alerts them to emergency situations and allows them to send in videos and photos of suspicious events.
The MHA said that as of the end of last year, more than 1.3 million devices were equipped with the SGSecure app, a large chunk of the population of around 5.6 million.
Simulations of terror attacks - including one just over a week ago where masked gunman stormed a children's activity center on the resort island of Sentosa - are regular. Last month, Singapore's military undertook its biggest mobilization exercise in more than three decades, including an inter-agency response to the simulation of a gunman at its national stadium.
Authorities said last year there was reliable information that IS militants were considering carrying out an attack in Singapore in the first half of 2016, a threat which they said was countered. 
In August 2016, neighboring Indonesia, which has the world's largest Muslim population, arrested six suspects with links to IS who were accused of plotting rocket attacks on Singapore's iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel.
Malaysia, Singapore's northern neighbor which also has a Muslim-majority, and Indonesia say thousands of their citizens sympathize with IS and hundreds are believed to have traveled to Syria to join the group. Regional security officials say many are returning home after reverses in the Middle East.
HARDLINE APPROACH
Singapore takes a hardline approach to suspected radicals and Bilveer Singh, an adjunct senior fellow at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies, says it is one of the reasons behind its success so far.
The most controversial measure at its disposal is its colonial-era Internal Security Act which allows for suspects to be held for lengthy periods without trial.
The MHA said it currently has 20 people detained under the Act for ""terrorism-related"" activities, and since 2002 has held close to 90 for such activities.
""ISA is a fantastic deterrent, and so far it has worked,"" Singh said. 

Authorities have also deported scores of foreigners for suspected radicalism in recent years, and in October banned two popular Muslim preachers from Zimbabwe and Malaysia from entering the city-state, saying their views bred intolerance and were a risk to its social harmony.

There has been rising concern in the South Asian nation about Chinese investment, a key part of Beijing's Belt and Road initiative to create a modern-day Silk Road across Asia.
Hundreds of Sri Lankans clashed with police at the opening last year of a Chinese-invested industrial zone in the south, saying they would not be moved from their land. It was the first time opposition to Chinese investments in Sri Lanka had turned violent.
Speaking on the sidelines of an independence day reception at the Sri Lankan embassy in Beijing, ambassador Karunasena Kodituwakku said a free trade agreement with China could not be rushed.
""We'd like to have the process a little longer. China would like to have it faster,"" Kodituwakku told Reuters.
""Because Sri Lanka being a small economy, we have to get a consensus from stakeholders,"" he added. ""Therefore the delay is due to the time period. But eventually we will sign the agreement.""
Sri Lanka last month signed a free trade agreement with Singapore, but Singapore's economy is not as complex as China's, Kodituwakku said.
""Chinese imports are very important to Sri Lanka, but opening up the whole thing in a short time may make some problems for local companies. Therefore we have to balance it.""
Sri Lanka has also been trying to get investment for a little utilized airport on its southern tip, in Mattala, built at a cost of $253 million by China, which also provided $230 million of funding.
""No doubt it was a white elephant. It is still a white elephant,"" Kodituwakku said.
India had been in advanced talks with Sri Lanka to operate the airport, but the ambassador said no deal had been reached.
""We have to turn it into a viable economic venture. In fact we gave the option to Chinese companies. I know Chinese companies have shown an interest, but according to our studies they were not having a viable economic plan and that's why they had to give the option to India,"" he said.
""The Indian offer had been there, but even that has not been finalised,"" Kodituwakku added.
""Anyone who want to come and turn the Mattala airport into a viable economic venture will be welcome. But unfortunately no one has taken over.""

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Costa Ricans vote for a new president on Sunday in a race upended in the final weeks by a debate over same-sex marriage, as leading candidates in the crowded field fiercely opposed gay rights that have recently been expanding in Latin America.
Conservative Christian singer and TV personality Fabricio Alvarado skyrocketed to the top of the 13-person field after speaking out against a January ruling by the region's top human rights court calling on Costa Rica to give equal civil marriage rights to gay and lesbian couples.
If no candidate wins at least 40 percent of Sunday's vote, a run-off election with the top two finishers is set for early April. 
The 43-year-old Alvarado, a congressman with the National Restoration Party, has called the ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights a violation of the country's sovereignty and an affront to traditional values.
""We have to stand up to those who want to trample on the family,"" he said at the campaign's final debate, threatening to pull out of the court over its resolution.
Rival Antonio Alvarez, a banana entrepreneur and candidate of the National Liberation Party, has said while he personally opposes the court's decision, he would respect it if he wins.
Among the few candidates who embraced the court's resolution is Carlos Alvarado, a former labor minister in the outgoing government of President Luis Gillermao Solis.
Elsewhere in the region, gay and lesbian couples can marry in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and in parts of Mexico.
Running a close second in one recent poll, conservative Juan Diego Castor, a former justice minister, is aiming to lure voters with an anti-crime platform as well as pushing for less restrictions on miners and oil companies.
A high-end coffee exporter, Costa Rica is well-known for its environmental stewardship and thriving eco-tourism sector.
Solis, a former diplomat and history professor, won in a landslide four years ago but has seen his popularity slide as an investigation into an influence peddling scandal has unfolded.
He is barred by law from seeking a second term.
Solis gained international attention when he hoisted a rainbow flag along with the Costa Rican flag atop his office just a week after he took office as a statement against homophobia.

Costa Rica's 3.3 million voters are predominantly Roman Catholic and most describe themselves as conservative.

QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuadoreans on Sunday vote in a referendum on whether to prevent unlimited presidential re-election, with polls indicating the motion will likely pass and block former leftist President Rafael Correa from returning to power.
President Lenin Moreno proposed the referendum to change the constitution in what was widely seen as a bid to halt Correa, his former mentor, from running for office again amid a bitter political dispute. 
Moreno, a wheelchair-bound former vice president elected last year, says the change would strengthen the oil-rich Andean nation's democracy. 
""Corruption sets in when you have only one government that thinks it will stay on forever,"" said Moreno during a campaign event this week in a low-income neighborhood of the mountainous capital Quito.
Moreno has a roughly 69 percent popularity level, according to pollster Cedatos, thanks to his conciliatory style and his crackdown on alleged graft during Correa's administration.
""I'm voting 'yes' for a change,"" said lawyer Andrea Ruales, 27, in Quito. ""Before, Correa decided. And now, they're asking the people."" 
Around 59 percent of Ecuadoreans plan to vote in favor of limiting re-election, versus some 27 percent who plan to vote against it, according to pollster Opinion Publica Ecuador. A handful of other surveys found a similar trend. 
Correa, however, says Moreno is a ""traitor"" seeking to annihilate him politically. 
While he has been living in Brussels with his Belgian wife since leaving office, Correa has returned several times to whip up support during campaign stops across Ecuador.
""They're trying to destroy everything that has to do with Correa,"" he told Reuters in an interview, flanked by several lawmakers who still call him ""president.""
The economist remains popular in some quarters for his welfare policy and an oil-fueled boom at the start of his decade-long presidency. 
""There have been no changes with Moreno. He's an ungrateful traitor because he does not recognize everything Correa did,"" said security guard Jose Delgado, 58. 
But many Ecuadoreans are tired of Correa's confrontational style and want to turn over a new leaf. 
Should Moreno score a resounding win on Sunday, he could shed some Correa-era cabinet members and feel emboldened to push through economic reforms. 
A loss could dampen his presidency as Correa would likely seek office again.

The vote includes six other questions on issues ranging from new anti-corruption measures to limiting mining and oil production in environmentally-sensitive areas. Results are expected around 8 p.m. local time (0100 GMT).

Japan's central government and Okinawa authorities have long bickered over a plan, first agreed between Tokyo and
Washington in 1996, to relocate the U.S. Marines' Futenma air base from an urban area in central Okinawa to the less populated Henoko district of the northern city of Nago.
Nago Mayor Susumu Inamine and Okinawa Governor Takeshi Onaga are among the opponents of the move, seeking to have Futenma's functions moved off Okinawa entirely. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government wants to forge ahead with the relocation.
Many Okinawa residents associate the U.S. military presence
with crime, pollution and accidents, and resentment has been
rekindled by a spate of incidents involving U.S. military
aircraft. In December, a window fell from a U.S. helicopter onto a school sports field, fanning safety concerns.
Inamine, who is seeking a third four-year term with
opposition support, was leading challenger Taketoyo
Toguchi, backed by Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner, the Komeito party, a Yomiuri newspaper survey published on Jan. 30 showed.
A win for Toguchi would make it easier for Abe's government
to carry through the relocation. A former local assembly member, Toguchi has pledged to improve the city's economy.
Work is underway for construction of a Futenma replacement
facility, but some aspects require approval from the Nago mayor, so the re-election of Inamine could bring delays.
Polls close at 8:00 p.m. (11:00 GMT) and media exit polls are expected afterwards. Final official results may not be available until early on Monday.

AMMAN/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Syrian rebels shot down a Russian warplane on Saturday and killed its pilot on the ground after he ejected from the plane, Russia's defense ministry and Syrian rebels said.
The SU-25 came down in an area of northern Idlib province that has seen heavy air strikes and fighting on the ground between Syria's government forces backed by Russia and Iran, and rebel groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
Syrians opposed to Assad see Russia as an invading force they blame for the deaths of thousands of civilians since Moscow joined the war on the side of the government in 2015.
The U.S. State Department said it had seen reports about the incident and allegations that the United States provided missiles to groups in Syria.
""The United States has never provided MANPAD missiles to any group in Syria, and we are deeply concerned that such weapons are being used,"" said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert. ""The solution to the violence is a return to the Geneva process as soon as possible and we call on Russia to live up to its commitments in that regards.""
The Russian plane was shot down over the town of Khan al-Subl near the city of Saraqeb, close to a major highway where the Syrian army and Iranian-backed militias are trying to advance, a rebel source said.
Although the Russian pilot escaped the crash, he was killed by rebels who had tried to capture him, the source said.
Tharir al-Sham, a jihadist group spearheaded by the former Syrian branch of al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for shooting down the plane on social media, saying one of its fighters had scored a direct hit with a shoulder launched anti-aircraft missile.
""This work is the least we can do to revenge our people. Let the criminal invaders know that our skies are not a picnic and they will not pass through without paying a price, God willing,"" senior commander Mahmoud Turkomani said in a statement released by the group.
Russia's Defence Ministry also said that the aircraft was downed by a portable surface-to-air missile. The pilot reported that he had ejected by parachute, it said, and he was later killed on the ground.
""The pilot died in a fight with terrorists,"" the ministry said.
PLANE WRECKAGE
TASS news agency quoted the Russian Defence Ministry as saying Moscow retaliated with a strike from an undisclosed high-precision weapon that killed more than 30 militants in an area of Idlib province where the plane was downed.
The Syrian opposition released footage on social media that purported to show the wreckage of the plane and the body of the pilot surrounded by fighters.
Rebels said the downed warplane had taken part in strikes that targeted civilian convoys fleeing along a major Syrian highway from villages that the army and foreign militias had overrun.
Syria's civil war, which is now entering its eighth year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million from their homes. 
A Russian plane was blamed for the death of seven civilians and scores of injuries after cars were targeted on the highway, according to a witness and two rebels sources.
Syrian soldiers and Iranian-backed militiamen were now around twelve kilometers from Saraqeb, advancing toward the Damascus-Aleppo highway under cover of heavy Russian air strikes, two opposition sources said.
At least five civilians were killed in Saraqeb city on Saturday, which residents blamed on Russian planes.
Syrians in rebel-held areas say they can distinguish between Russian warplanes and those of the Syrian air force, because the Russian planes fly at higher altitude.
Residents say thousands of people have been forced by air strikes to flee the area, moving further north to the safety of makeshift camps on the Syrian side of the Turkish border.

Russia's Defence Ministry regularly says it targets only hardline Islamist militants in Syria.

A Reuters witness said about 200 Palestinians were throwing stones at Israeli military vehicles when a gunshot was heard, adding that a wounded person was then carried to a car.
Israel's military said its forces had been searching in Burqin for suspects involved in the fatal drive-by shooting of an Israeli rabbi from a nearby settlement on Jan. 9.
A military spokeswoman said rioting had broken out while troops were apprehending several suspects connected with that shooting and troops responded with non-fatal ""riot dispersal means"" against Palestinians throwing rocks and firebombs and then with live gunfire at the main instigators.
The Palestinian Health Ministry said the teenager killed on Saturday was 19 years old, while the hospital in Jenin where he was taken said he had been shot in the head.
The Israeli military spokeswoman said he had climbed onto a military vehicle and had opened its door before he was shot.
Israeli forces in the adjacent city of Jenin last month shot and killed a Palestinian gunman whom they had also suspected of involvement in the rabbi's shooting.
Tensions in the region have risen since U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December. Since then at least 20 Palestinians and one Israeli have been killed.
Trump's reversal of decades of U.S. policy enraged Palestinians, who want to create an independent state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Israel captured those territories in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally. It says the entire city is its eternal, indivisible capital. It pulled out of Gaza in 2005.
U.S.-led peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014. A bid by Trump's administration to restart negotiations has shown no real signs of progress.

148,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Pressure mounts on Poland to back away from Holocaust bill,"By Lidia Kelly and Anna Wlodarczak
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland is seeing a resurgence of anti-Semitism over pending legislation that would impose jail terms for suggestions that the nation was complicit in the Holocaust, local minority groups warned, as pressure mounts on the president to veto the bill. 
Parliament passed the measure on Thursday, drawing outrage from Israel, U.S. criticism and condemnation from a number of international organizations. President Andrzej Duda has 21 days to decide whether to sign it into law.
The bill would impose prison sentences of up to three years for mentioning the term ""Polish death camps"" and for suggesting ""publicly and against the facts"" complicity on the part of the Polish nation or state in Nazi Germany's crimes.
More than three million of Poland's 3.2 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis, accounting for about half of the Jews killed in the Holocaust. Jews from across Europe were sent to be killed at death camps built and operated by the Germans on Polish soil, including Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor.
According to figures from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Nazis also killed at least 1.9 million non-Jewish Polish civilians.
In a rare show of unity, Polish minority and ethnic groups, including Jewish, Ukrainian and Russian, urged Duda and other authorities to counteract all forms of xenophobia, intolerance and anti-Semitism, although they did not directly call on the president to veto the bill. 
""Our particular concern and objection is caused by the numerous and loud manifestations of anti-Semitism that we have been witnessing this week after the (parliament) passed (the Holocaust bill),"" the groups said in statement.
GERMAN DEATH CAMPS
Poland, which has gone through a painful public debate in recent years after the publication of research showing some Poles participated in the Nazi atrocities, has long sought to discourage use of the term ""Polish camps"" to refer to Nazi camps on its territory, arguing that the phrase implies complicity.
On Saturday, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said the use of the phrase ""Polish death camps"" was wrong.
""There is not the slightest doubt as to who was responsible for the extermination camps, operated them and murdered millions of European Jews there: namely Germans,"" Gabriel said in a statement.
Israeli officials said the legislation criminalizes basic historical facts. The country's foreign ministry said on Thursday that Israel ""adamantly opposes"" the bill's approval as a whole. 
The Israeli embassy in Warsaw said late on Friday that Israel does not oppose Poland's fight for assuring the phrase ""Polish death camps"" is never used. 
""We would like to use this opportunity to repeat that Israel stands with Poland in using the proper term for the death camps - German Nazi camps,"" the embassy said in its statement.
The embassy also said that it has received ""a wave of anti-Semitic statements"" in the past week. 
Poland is one of the most ethnically and religiously homogenous countries in Europe, but before World War Two Jews made up 10 percent of the population and the country also had large Ukrainian, German, Belarussian and other minorities.
Poland's ruling party, the socially conservative PiS, has reignited debate on the Holocaust as part of a campaign to fuel patriotism since sweeping into power in 2015.
The party says the bill is needed to protect Poland's reputation and ensure historians recognize that Poles as well as Jews were victims of the Nazis. 
Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the chairman of the PiS and de facto the country's leader, told the public radio Jedynka on Saturday that Poland rejects ""anti-Semitism very radically"".
""But we are also a sovereign state and we have a duty to start, because this is only the beginning, the fight against ... this great defamatory campaign against Poland, namely, insulting Poland, blaming us for someone else's actions.""
FREE SPEECH 
Critics of the bill have raised concerns it will curb free speech and could potentially be used against Holocaust survivors or historians. 
A U.S. congressional task force on combating anti-Semitism and a number of Jewish groups urged Duda to veto the bill.
The International Auschwitz Council, an advisory body to the office of the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said on Friday the bill's imprecision raised ""legitimate concerns about restricting freedom in discovering the truth about the Holocaust"".
Duda has not said whether he will sign the bill, but his spokesman told the Polish state radio Trojka: ""The president believes that Poland, as any other country, has the right to defend its good name ... has the right to defend the truth"".
Kaczynski said that Duda should sign the law.

""We must talk to our allies in a way that would allow them to understand that we have no intention of renouncing our dignity,"" he said.

No one at the North Korean embassy in Berlin was immediately available to comment on the allegation.
In a program to be aired on NDR television on Monday, BfV head Hans-Georg Maassen said: ""We determined that procurement activities have been carried out from there that are, in our view, done with a view to the missile program and sometimes also for the nuclear program.""
He said it was often so-called dual use goods, which can be used for both civil and military purposes.
Comments released by NDR ahead of the broadcast showed Maassen said German authorities prevented such activities when they found them but he added: ""We can't guarantee that we can detect and prevent this in all cases.""
He said it was necessary to presume that parts for North Korea's launch program ""were acquired via other markets or underground buyers had acquired them in Germany"".

North Korea has defied years of multilateral and bilateral sanctions with a weapons program aimed at developing nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.

ROME (Reuters) - An Italian man opened fire on African migrants in the central city of Macerata on Saturday, injuring six people before he was captured, in what police said was a racially motivated attack.
The shootings happened just days after a Nigerian migrant was arrested in connection with the death of an 18-year-old Italian woman, whose dismembered body was discovered stuffed into two suitcases near Macerata.
Police named the suspected shooter as Luca Traini, 28, and said he had an Italian flag draped over his shoulders when he was seized in the street by armed police. Onlookers said he made a fascist salute before being handcuffed.
""He drove around in his car and when he saw any black people he shot them,"" Marcello Mancini, a Macerata resident, told Reuters television. Police said one of the six victims was seriously hurt and needed surgery, but gave no further details.
Traini also fired shots at the offices of the ruling center-left Democratic Party (PD) in Macerata, but did not injure anyone there. The PD said he had stood as a candidate for the rightist Northern League at local elections last year but had not received any votes.
The League backs fiercely anti-immigrant policies and is part of ex-prime Silvio Berlusconi's center-right alliance that is leading in the polls ahead of a March 4 national election.
League leader Matteo Salvini distanced himself from the shooting, but blamed mass immigration for the tensions.
""I can't wait to get into government to restore security, social justice and serenity to Italy,"" he told reporters.
PD leader Matteo Renzi called for calm.
""The man who fired the gun, hitting six people of color, is a squalid, mad person. But the state is stronger than him,"" he wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said Italy would come down heavily on anyone promoting violence.
""We will stop this risk. We will stop it immediately. We will stop it together,"" he said. ""Hatred and violence will not be able to divide us.""
DENIED ASYLUM
Police said the shooter drove around Macerata, which is famed for its outdoor opera festivals, in a black Alfa Romeo car firing out of his window at migrants in various locations.
With police closing in, he left his car in the city center but was almost immediately stopped. Local media said he shouted, ""Long live Italy,"" as he was taken away.
Tensions in Macerata had risen this week following the gruesome discovery of Pamela Mastropietro's body. The teenager had run away from a drug rehabilitation center on Monday and met a Nigerian asylum seeker, Innocent Oseghale, the next day.
Her body was found on Wednesday and a preliminary postmortem could not immediately identify the cause of death.
Witnesses said they had earlier seen Oseghale with the suitcases in which the body was found. He refused to talk to the police after his arrest. Newspapers said he was denied asylum last year but had remained in Macerata to appeal against the decision.
""What was this worm still doing in Italy?"" Northern League leader Salvini wrote on Facebook at mid-week, accusing the center-left government of responsibility for Mastropietro's death for allowing migrants to stay in the country.
""The left has blood on its hands,"" he wrote.
More than 600,000 mainly African migrants have reached Italy by boat over the past four years, and thousands have perished on the journey. The center-right bloc, which includes the League, says the vast majority have no right to asylum and has promised mass expulsions if it takes power.
Leftist parties have ruled out any such deportations.

""What happened today in Macerata shows that inciting hatred and whitewashing fascism, as Salvini does, has consequences. It can spark violence,"" said Laura Boldrini, a leftist politician and the speaker of the lower house of parliament.

A senior Turkish government official denied the report on Saturday, repeating that Turkey had taken in 3.5 million war refugees since the Syrian conflict began in 2011.
New York-based Human Rights Watch said Syrians were now fleeing heightened violence in the northwestern province of Idlib to seek refuge near Turkey's border, which remains closed to all but critical medical cases.
Syrian armed forces have thrust deeper into the mainly rebel-held province in recent months and Turkey last month launched military action in the nearby Afrin region, targeting Kurdish YPG militia fighters.
""Syrians fleeing to the Turkish border seeking safety and asylum are being forced back with bullets and abuse,"" Lama Fakih, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said.
President Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin, asked about the HRW statement, told reporters that Turkish soldiers were there to protect these people and that Ankara has had an ""open-door policy"" since the start of Syria's civil war in 2011.
A senior government official later told Reuters:
""There has been absolutely no case of civilians being fired upon at the border.""
HRW cited U.N. figures saying 247,000 Syrians were displaced to the border area between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15.
""As fighting in Idlib and Afrin displaces thousands more, the number of Syrians trapped along the border willing to risk their lives to reach Turkey is only likely to increase,"" Fakih said.
In the latest fighting in Afrin, five Turkish soldiers were killed on Saturday when their tank was hit in an attack carried out by YPG fighters, Turkey's armed forces said.
UNDER FIRE
Of 16 Syrian refugees HRW spoke to, 13 alleged that Turkish border guards had shot toward them or other fleeing asylum seekers as they tried to cross while still in Syria, killing 10 people, including one child, and injuring several more.
Turkey has taken in more Syrian refugees than any other country, granting many temporary protection status and providing them with basic services, including medical care and education.
""However, Turkey's generous hosting of large numbers of Syrians does not absolve it of its responsibility to help those seeking protection at its borders,"" the HRW statement added.
It said Erdogan's government should issue standard instructions to border guards at all crossing points that lethal force must not be used against asylum seekers and that no asylum seeker is to be mistreated.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - At least 11 soldiers were killed and 13 wounded on Saturday in a suicide attack near an army base in northern Pakistan, officials said, in a region that was once controlled by a local faction of the Taliban.
Attacks have decreased sharply in the picturesque Swat Valley but can cause alarm in a region where Pakistani Taliban insurgents took partial control in 2007, before being ousted two years later in a major military operation hailed as an important blow against Islamist violence.
Swat was the first sizeable region outside Pakistan’s lawless tribal regions bordering Afghanistan to fall to the militants. More than 2,000 Taliban fighters have been driven out of the region, government officials say.
The Pakistan Army's public relations wing said in a statement that the ""suicide attack"" in the Swat Valley took place at the ""army unit sports area"".
""The soldiers were playing volleyball in the evening outside the military base...when a suicide bomber managed to blow himself up,"" said a security official who asked not to be identified.
The match was also being watched by civilians, and the casualty count could rise as a large number of people had gathered in the area, he said, adding that wounded were being shifted to a nearby military hospital. 
The attack was claimed by the Tehreek-e-Taliban, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, in a statement sent to the media. 
""God willing Tehreek-e-Taliban has started the process of revenge attacks,"" Taliban spokesman Mohammad Khurasani said in the statement. ""Wait for more (attacks) to follow.""
The military has been on alert for signs of a Taliban resurgence as it seeks to rebuild civilian institutions and win over the local population as a bulwark against radical ideology.
Since being chased out the region, the Taliban have carried out revenge attacks against anti-militancy activists and attempted to extort money from business owners in a region where Pakistan has stationed more than 4,000 soldiers.
Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi condemned the attack.
""No cowardly attack can deter us in pursuing our struggle against the menace of terrorism to its logical conclusion. We will continue our fight till the last trace is rooted out,"" the prime minister said in a statement.

153,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2018 11:47AM ET</span>",Germany's potential coalition partners wrangle over health and labor,"By Andreas Rinke and Michelle Martin
BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) sought to resolve disputes on healthcare and labor rules on Saturday during talks to form a government more than four months after an election.
The two camps aim to seal a deal to renew the ""grand coalition"" that has governed Europe's largest economy since 2013 by the end of Sunday, although some politicians say they could run into Monday or Tuesday.
SPD deputy Manuela Schwesig urged the conservatives to compromise on abolishing fixed-term contracts for workers and reforming Germany's public-private healthcare system.
""I don't think Mrs Merkel can explain why there can't be any movement there,"" she said as she arrived for talks.
The SPD wants to prove to its skeptical members that it would be able to push through those core policies in the role of junior partner to make another ""grand coalition"" more appealing.
Many of the SPD's 443,000 members - who will get the chance to vote on any coalition deal - would prefer to revamp the party in opposition rather than another alliance with Merkel after suffering their worst post-war election result in September.
As a compromise, the conservatives have offered to ban the repeated renewal of fixed-term contracts but they do not want to prevent employers from using them. The parties are still working on the topic.
The two camps made some progress on labor policy on Friday by agreeing that employees in companies with more than 45 employees should have the right to move seamlessly back and forth between full- and part-time work.
MAJOR OBSTACLE
Healthcare is a big stumbling block and party sources said Merkel and her Bavarian ally Horst Seehofer discussed the issue before meeting with the SPD.
The conservatives reject replacing the current system with a ""citizen's insurance"" as called for by the SPD and talks are now expected to focus on improving the position of those with public healthcare such as by changing billing rules for doctors, who earn more by treating private patients.
In a sign they are getting closer to a deal, the parties reached an accord on energy and environment, agreeing to set legally binding climate targets for sectors like energy, transport, agriculture and construction to reach by 2030.
Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks said national climate targets for 2020 would not be quite reached but the new targets, which would be written into law in 2019, would ensure Germany can remain a ""climate protection pioneer"".
They also agreed on agriculture, saying they wanted to put an end to the use of weedkiller glyphosate as quickly as possible and ban the cultivation of genetically modified plants.
In a full day of negotiations, the parties were also hoping to tick off issues including finances, rents and real estate prices and municipalities.
They reached a deal on migration on Friday, agreeing to stick to the wording of January's coalition blueprint that said the parties did not expect annual migration to exceed 220,000 per year.
But the two were still wrangling over its meaning on Saturday, with Joachim Herrmann - a member of Merkel's CSU Bavarian allies who have called for an upper limit - telling Rheinische Post his party had secured a migrant cap.
Meanwhile, SPD deputy Ralf Stegner insisted the number is merely a prediction, writing on Twitter: ""The fact remains that the SPD has not agreed to any upper limit and will not do so.""

Migration is a sensitive issue given the influx of more than a million migrants since mid-2015 and the conservatives' subsequent loss of support to the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) in September's national election.

One soldier was killed and five wounded during two days of clashes, one of which took place near the Dhahra oilfield on Saturday, said Umar al-Faqeh, head of the Maradah administration to which the area belongs. There had been fighting already in another area on Friday, he added.
The field is operated by Waha, a joint-venture between Libya's state National Oil Company and U.S. firms Hess, Marathon and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).
The oil protection force guarding the Waha operations is allied to country's eastern government. The U.N.-backed administration sits in the capital Tripoli in western Libya. 
The North African country has been mired in conflict since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and in December armed men blew up a Waha pipeline pumping crude to Es Sider port, temporarily cutting Libyan output by around 100,000 barrels per day. Officials blamed ""terrorists"", without giving details.
The area has poor security and sources say it has been populated by Islamic State fighters since they lost control of their stronghold in Libya, the central city of Sirte, in 2016.

COTTBUS, Germany (Reuters) - Arab refugees and Germans carrying pro-immigrant and anti-fascism placards marched in Cottbus on Saturday to denounce what they say are attempts by far-right groups to stoke tension in the eastern city after two knife attacks by Syrian teenagers.
""We want to stop this hate between Germans and Arab refugees,"" said Ahmad al-Barqouni, a 28-year-old Syrian student, marching through the city with around 1,500 other people. 
""Some people made mistakes but not everyone should pay the price for it,"" he added, referring to the knife attacks.
Police beefed up security in the city of 100,000 near the Polish border, where the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) beat Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives in an election last year by appealing to voters angry with her decision in 2015 to welcome more than a million asylum seekers.
COUNTER MARCH 
Residents and members of far-right groups carrying anti-Islam banners held a counter march through the city a few hours later to protest against what they say is rising crime by migrants.
More than 3,000 people shouted ""Merkel must go!"", ""We are the people!"" and ""Lying press!"" in a main square before marching peacefully through the city escorted by riot police.
Addressing the crowd through a loud speaker, one organizer urged the demonstrators not to talk to journalists covering the march: ""Look, smile, but don't touch!"" she said. 
Last month, two Syrian teenagers injured a 16-year-old German boy with a knife and a group of three Syrians aged under 17 threatened a German couple with a knife outside a mall in Cottbus.
The attacks prompted almost weekly demonstrations by residents opposed to more migrants arriving in Cottbus. The interior ministry of Brandenburg, the federal state in which Cottbus lies, stopped sending refugees to the city last month.
ANXIETY
""We are here to make a clear stance against a rightist hate campaign,"" said Lea Bunke, a 25-year-old German student at the first march, adding that the knife attacks by Syrian teenagers did not justify demands by some residents that all refugees leave the city.
She said Cottbus residents should be more alarmed by a rise in xenophobic attacks against refugees.
Anxiety about immigration is high in Cottbus, as in many eastern regions in Germany, where older generations grew up under communism, having little contact with foreigners.
Hans-Christoph Berndt, leader of 'Zukunft Heimat' or Future Homeland, an umbrella group that has been organizing anti-immigrant protests, said his supporters were protesting against the government's immigration policy, not against migrants.
""The media have been misrepresenting us,"" Berndt said. ""We are protesting against the decision to welcome everyone. There aren't enough police, not enough kindergarten places and not enough teachers. We are demanding that Merkel step down.""
Police on Wednesday arrested six members of the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) - which Germany's Constitutional Court last year said resembled Adolf Hitler's Nazi party - who were handing out tear gas and flyers to Cottbus residents.

The city's technical university draws hundreds of international students each year, and the influx of foreigners and refugees has prevented the population from shrinking below 100,000 from about 145,000 on the eve of German reunification in 1990.

157,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",BBC journalist ordered to leave Indonesia's Papua over tweets,"By Ed Davies and Agustinus Beo Da Costa
JAKARTA (Reuters) - A BBC journalist on a reporting trip to cover a health and malnutrition crisis in Indonesia's easternmost area of Papua was forced to leave the province after the country's military said tweets she sent on her trip had ""hurt soldiers' feelings"".
Papua is one of Indonesia's poorest areas and President Joko Widodo after coming to power in 2014 pledged to speed up its development and ease media restrictions in the area, where there has been a simmering secessionist movement.
But while investment has risen and efforts made to address some human rights concerns, activists say foreign journalists continue to be blocked or face obstacles when trying to report. 
Indonesia's military said in a statement that a tweet sent by Rebecca Henschke, BBC Indonesia's editor, had ""hurt the feelings of TNI (Indonesian military) personnel"" involved in relief efforts in the Asmat area.
Henschke had tweeted a photo of supplies on her personal Twitter account, adding: ""This is the aid coming in for severely malnourished children in Papua - instant noodles, super sweet soft drinks and biscuits.""   
Papua military spokesman Colonel Muhammad Aidi said: ""(The food and drink) that she took the picture of at the speedboat pier are not donations or aid. It was merchandise from merchants that was incidentally there."" Aidi also described two other tweets as misleading.
Henschke, a Jakarta-based Australian citizen, later took down the photograph and tweeted: ""Adding important NOTE: Other sources say this is NOT aid but normal supplies. Huge relief effort underway here.""
Indonesia has deployed additional military personnel to help in Asmat, where at least 61 infants are reported to have died from malnutrition and diseases such as measles.
Henschke had asked to be allowed to continue covering the story during questioning by security forces over her tweets on Friday, but was escorted to the city of Timika and held by immigration, the military statement said.
Henschke declined to comment, but a BBC spokesperson said via email: ""A BBC team on a deployment to Papua province has now returned to Jakarta. They had the necessary documentation and the authorities were aware of their visit. The BBC respects local laws wherever it operates."" 
Many Papuans, who are predominantly Christian and a minority in Muslim-majority Indonesia, criticize Jakarta for neglecting Papua and instead being too focused on the densely-populated island of Java.
Catholic priest and rights activist John Jonga blamed the crisis on a lack of vaccinations and a switch from more nutritious tubers to rice as a staple food. Some of the forest-dwelling Asmat are also reported to be increasingly relying on instant food or energy drinks. 
Andreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch said Henschke's treatment showed pledges to open up Papua had not materialised. 
""She had her travel permit - the only Indonesian area where foreign journalists need to get a permit to visit - and still got intimidation for a single tweet,"" said Harsono.

A presidential spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

158,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2018 09:26AM ET</span>","With an eye on Russia, U.S. to increase nuclear capabilities","By Idrees Ali
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Concerned about Russia's growing tactical nuclear weapons, the United States will expand its nuclear capabilities, a policy document released on Friday said, a move some critics say could increase the risk of miscalculation between the two countries.
It represents the latest sign of hardening resolve by President Donald Trump's administration to address challenges from Russia, at the same time he is pushing for improved ties with Moscow to rein in a nuclear North Korea.
The focus on Russia is in line with the Pentagon shifting priorities from the fight against Islamist militants to ""great power competition"" with Moscow and Beijing.
""Our strategy will ensure Russia understands that any use of nuclear weapons, however limited, is unacceptable,"" the document, known as the Nuclear Posture Review, said.
The rationale for building up new nuclear capabilities, U.S. officials said, is that Russia currently perceives the United States' nuclear posture and capabilities as inadequate.
Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday it was very disappointed by the content of the document, which, it said, has a confrontational feel and anti-Russian orientation. 
""We, of course, will have to take into account the approach enacted now in Washington and to take the needed measures to secure our own safety,"" the ministry said.
It denied accusations against Russia made in the U.S. document. 
The ministry added that Russia was ready to work constructively with the Americans. 
By expanding its own low-yield nuclear capability, the United States would deter Russia from using nuclear weapons, U.S. officials argue.
Low-yield nuclear weapons, while still devastating, have a strength of less than 20 kilotons. The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima had about the same explosive power.
The argument for these weapons is that larger nuclear bombs are so catastrophic that they would never be used and do not work as an effective deterrent. With less power and destruction, the low-yield option would potentially be more likely to be used, serving as an effective deterrent.
The Pentagon document, which is largely in line with the previous review in 2010, said the United States will modify a small number of submarine-launched ballistic missile warheads with low-yield options.
LONG TERM 
In the long term, the U.S. military will also develop a new nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile. The missile could have the less powerful option, but a decision has not been made, and will take up to a decade to develop, officials said.
Greg Weaver, deputy director of strategic capabilities at the Pentagon, said the United States would be willing to limit developing the missile if Russia would ""redress the imbalance in non-strategic nuclear forces"".
Weaver said the most difficult task for those working on the review was trying to address the gap between Russian and American non-strategic nuclear weapons. 
Russia has a stockpile of 2,000 non-strategic nuclear weapons, according to the Pentagon. The U.S. has a few hundred active low-yield weapons deployed in Europe.
The U.S. State Department said it had briefed Russian and Chinese officials on the review.
U.S. officials argue that since the last nuclear review, Russia has expanded and modernized its non-strategic nuclear weapons, annexed Crimea in 2014, and deployed a ground-launched cruise missile that breaches the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. The treaty bans testing and fielding missiles with ranges of 500-5,500 km (310-3,417 miles). The report also, for the first time publicly, said Russia was developing a hypersonic, nuclear-powered undersea torpedo.
""The U.S. is not arms racing, we are responding to Russian initiative here,"" Weaver said.
Some experts have questioned the expansion. 
Jon Wolfsthal, a former top advisor to President Barack Obama on arms control, said there was a possibility that it could lead to a miscalculation.
""If we put nuclear weapons on cruise missiles and we launch conventional cruise missiles, how does Russia know that they are conventional?"" he said.
The review called for continuing the B-83 bomb, the largest nuclear weapon in the U.S. stockpile, until a replacement is found, reversing plans to retire i
The document argues that by developing U.S. nuclear responses, it raises the Russian threshold for using the weapons, rather than lowering the U.S. threshold.
Kingston Reif, director for disarmament research at the Arms Control Association advocacy group, said the document could bolster a new kind of arms race.

""It's not an arms race in terms of numbers like during the Cold War, but is an arms race that involves more than just the United States and Russia and it involves upgrading and improving the capability of existing nuclear forces,"" Reif said.

159,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",Afghan president leaves open possibility of talks with some Taliban,"By Hamid Shalizi
KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani left open on Saturday the possibility for talks with militants who accept peace but said the door was closed to those who cause tragedies like recent attacks in the capital, Kabul.
An attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul on Jan. 20 and a suicide bombing on a crowded city street a week later have stoked public anger and stepped up pressure on Ghani's Western-backed government to improve security.
The attacks, which killed more than 130 people and were claimed by the Taliban, have also raised fresh doubt about long-running efforts to initiate talks with the insurgents.
The president's office said on Tuesday the militants had crossed a ""red line"" and peace would have to be won on the battle field.
But Ghani raised the possibility of reconciliation with some militants in a speech to Islamic clerics in Kabul.
""Those who are responsible for this tragedy and do not want peace, the door of peace is closed to them,"" Ghani said.
""Those who accept peace, they will witness that the nation will embrace them. But there is a clear difference, our commitment to bringing peace does not mean we will sit quietly and won't retaliate.""
""We will dig them out from any hiding holes.""
Afghanistan's government has made such vows for years but the insurgency appears ever more resilient. Peace efforts have been made in fits and starts but without progress.
U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to dash any hope for peace efforts on Monday when he condemned the Taliban for the Kabul violence and rejected the idea of talks.
Trump last year ordered an increase in U.S. troops, air strikes and other assistance to Afghan forces, to force the Taliban to negotiate.
But his comments on Monday suggested he saw a military victory over the Taliban, an outcome that U.S. military and diplomatic officials said could not be achieved with the resources and manpower he had authorized.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan said in Kabul on Tuesday the U.S. strategy had not changed and the aim was still to press the Taliban militarily to convince them that they had to negotiate.
The Taliban are fighting to drive out foreign troops and re-establish their form of strict Islamic law.
Afghanistan has long accused neighboring Pakistan of failing to act against Taliban plotting violence from safe havens on the Pakistani side of the border.
On Friday, Ghani accused Pakistan of being the ""Taliban center"" and said he was waiting for Pakistani action.
Pakistan denies helping the Taliban and a Pakistani delegation led by Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua visited Kabul on Saturday with the aim of fostering cooperation. Janjua called for both sides to stop the ""blame game"", Pakistani media reported.

The United States said last month it would cut security aid to Pakistan, complaining it was not doing enough to fight militants sheltering there.

It took place in an area where Syrian and Iranian-backed troops were pushing, with air cover, towards a rebel-held town in northwestern Idlib province, they said. 
Syrian soldiers and Iranian-backed militiamen were now around twelve kilometers from Saraqeb, advancing towards the Damascus-Aleppo highway under cover of heavy Russian air strikes, two opposition sources said.
Rescuers said at least seven civilians were pulled out of the wreckage of cars after the air strikes on Friday. 
""We believe two Russian planes struck the convoy of civilians on the highway and left at least seven killed and twelve injured, mostly elderly and children,"" said Ammar al Adnan, a civil defense worker from Saraqeb.
Activists' videos on social media showed rescuers extinguishing fires on the route, used by thousands of villagers fleeing areas south of Aleppo now overrun by the Syrian army and its allies.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the footage.
Russia's defense ministry regularly says it is attacking hardline Islamist militants. It denies opposition and witness accounts that its planes target civilians, market places, medical centers and residential areas away from frontlines. 
Syrian media made no mention of the strikes.
A major Syrian army offensive, begun earlier this year in southern Aleppo and eastern Idlib, has allowed it to take control of a large amount of territory from rebel forces. 
The advances have caused an exodus of thousands of civilians to the relative safety of territory further north towards the Turkish border.
Air raids have struck several cave hospitals and exacerbated a refugee crisis along the Turkish frontier, where camps now house tens thousands of displaced people.
The army confirmed new gains on Saturday, saying it had seized a string of villages from al Qaeda fighters, state television said, quoting a military source.

Zuma faces a growing chorus of calls for him to resign as president and is expected to meet the ANC's six most powerful officials this weekend, state broadcaster SABC said. 
Deputy President Ramaphosa is in pole position to win an election next year and many in the party want Zuma out so that Ramaphosa can embark on his anti-corruption agenda. 
""There should be a change of guard. You can't have two centers of power. The best possible way is if the state president exits,"" ANC treasurer-general Paul Mashatile told CNBC Africa late on Friday.
""How do you do it? .... Go to him and say 'look we're not booting you out but we think we can work better this way',"" he said. There was no immediate comment from an ANC spokeswoman.
Zuma faces a no-confidence vote on Feb. 22 after a request from the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters but Mashatile said he opposed that method of removing the president.
Zuma, who is battling corruption allegations, has been in a weakened position since he was replaced as leader of the ANC in December by Cyril Ramaphosa, the deputy president.

Mashatile, Ramaphosa and the rest of the top-six leadership team, were in the northern Limpopo province on Saturday to meet traditional leaders.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police on Saturday briefly detained a third opposition legislator who attended a symbolic ""swearing-in"" of opposition leader Raila Odinga that was a direct challenge to President Uhuru Kenyatta, who won re-election in October.
The government has made several arrests and suspended three television channels that had planned to stream Tuesday's event.
George Aladwa, a member of Odinga's National Resistance Movement, was detained by police in the capital Nairobi, his lawyer Nelson Havi told Reuters.
""He was interrogated in connection with the oath taken by Kenyan main opposition leader Raila Odinga as the people's president,"" he said. 
Aladwa, who denied any wrongdoing, was ordered to report back on Tuesday, Havi added. A police spokesman said he was not aware of his detention.
The arrest follows that of opposition politician Miguna Miguna, who was detained in a dawn raid on his Nairobi home on Friday and that of another opposition leader a day earlier.
Miguna was released on bail of 50,000 Kenyan shillings ($500).
Miguna stood beside Odinga at Tuesday's rally and declared himself the ""general"" of Odinga's National Resistance Movement, which authorities have designated a ""criminal group"" because of its stated intent to establish a parallel government.
Kenya's ban on three private television stations defied a court order to lift the move. The media crackdown has been criticized by the United Nations and the United States.

The arrests and broadcast bans have shocked many Kenyans used to a freewheeling media and irreverent political culture that has taken root since 2002.

MALE (Reuters) - As domestic and international pressure mounts, the Maldives has delayed complying with a Supreme Court order for the immediate release and new trials of nine opposition leaders, freeing them to contest presidential elections this year.
The Indian Ocean nation has been mired in political unrest since Mohamed Nasheed, its first democratically elected leader, was ousted in 2012. He has been in exile on medical grounds from a 13-year jail sentence on terrorism charges.
The Supreme Court on Thursday said the trials of Nasheed and eight others, many of whom had challenged President Abdulla Yameen, had violated the constitution and international law. It found that prosecutors and judges were unduly influenced ""to conduct politically motivated investigations"" against them.
On Friday, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said he had held discussions with Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed over the administration’s concerns about releasing individuals whose offences ranged from terrorism to corruption and treason. 
""The prosecutor general is currently in the process of examining the cases to determine the best way to proceed with the implementation of the Supreme Court’s ruling, and the prosecutor general will present recommendations at the earliest,"" the government said in a statement.
The unexpected ruling frees opposition leaders to run against Yameen in the presidential poll expected to be completed by October. The terrorism convictions would normally bar them from competing unless they received presidential pardons after completing a third of their jail terms. 
The joint opposition of the Maldives expressed concern over Yameen’s refusal to abide by the order.
""We are deeply fearful that the government’s refusal to implement the Supreme Court order could escalate to unrest and incite violence across the country,"" it said in a statement.
Hundreds of opposition supporters chanted slogans such as ""Enforce the Supreme Court ruling,"" and ""Defend the constitution,"" in a Friday night rally outside the opposition MDP campaign center in Male, the capital.
The United Nations, the United States, the European Union and India also urged Yameen's government to follow the ruling. 
In a statement, the office of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, ""The Secretary-General reiterates his belief in finding a solution to the political stalemate in the Maldives through all-party talks, which the United Nations continues to stand ready to facilitate."" 
""We understand the situation is extremely tense,"" Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights told reporters on Friday.
The agency was ""closely watching how the situation develops in the aftermath of Thursday's decisions by the Supreme Court, and in particular, the reactions of the government, military and police,"" he added. 
The European Union urged the government to hold ""inclusive dialogue with the leaders of all political parties that should pave the way for credible, transparent and inclusive elections"".
Nasheed, who has been in exile in Britain, had sought U.N. help to restore the political rights of which he was stripped after a trial denounced as hasty and unfair by the United Nations human rights chief.

Thursday's decision also nullified a ruling in which 12 lawmakers lost their parliamentary seats for defecting last July from Yameen's ruling party, costing him his majority in the 85-member legislature.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - The families of victims of human rights abuses under former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori testified on Friday at an international human rights tribunal, asking the court to annul the controversial pardon of the former leader late last year.
Fujimori, who served as president during the 1990s, was less than halfway into a 25-year prison term stemming from convictions on human rights abuses when current President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski issued the pardon to the ailing 79-year-old.
While groups such as Amnesty International harshly criticized the pardon, about 65 percent of Peruvians support it, according to a recent poll. 
The pardon was issued on Christmas Eve, and met by thousands of enraged protesters who took to the streets to criticize what many viewed as a miscarriage of justice.
Shortly after he announced his decision, Kuczynski, who was also facing his own possible removal from office by Peru's Congress, described it as a ""humanitarian pardon.""
Critics who accompanied victims' families before the Costa Rica-based Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) on Friday described it very differently.
""The pardon was contrary to law and a measure of impunity that must be revoked,"" said Viviana Krsticevic, head of the Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL).
Krsticevic argued that Kuczynski's reasoning behind the pardon, details of which were publicly revealed for the first time on Friday, was full of inconsistencies and contradictions.
Lawyers representing the Peruvian government denied the pardon was the result of a political pact between Kuczynski and the Fujimori family, which continues to maintain considerable political influence in the Congress.
""Speculation should be kept outside the court,"" said lawyer Adrian Simons.
In late January, Reuters reported that three months before he granted Fujimori the pardon, Kuczynski met the former leader's son, lawmaker Kenji Fujimori, to discuss his release.
At the meeting, Kenji Fujimori offered Kuczynski political support in Congress in return for the pardon.
Simons added that any disagreement over the pardon should be resolved by Peru's justice system and he alleged that the IACHR was being used as a ""shortcut.""
If the court's resolution, expected in the next few weeks, revokes the pardon, Peru's government is obligated to accept it.
""We hope Fujimori goes back to prison to serve his sentence,"" said Carmen Amaro, sister of Armando Amaro, who was killed in a 1992 massacre during Fujimori's rule that was cited in his conviction. 

""This isn't hatred or revenge,"" she said. ""It's justice.""

Tillerson, in a speech ahead of a visit to Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Jamaica, said China was getting a foothold in Latin America, using economic statecraft to pull the region into its orbit.
In a statement released late on Friday responding to Tillerson, China's Foreign Ministry said cooperation between China and Latin America is based on common interests and mutual needs.
""What the United States said is entirely against the truth and displayed disrespect to the vast number of Latin American countries,"" the ministry said.
Cooperation between China and Latin American countries is based on equality, reciprocity, openness and inclusiveness, it added.
""China is a major international buyer of Latin American bulk commodities, and imports more and more agricultural and high value-added products from the region,"" the ministry said.
China's investment in and financial cooperation with Latin American countries are in full accordance with commercial rules and local laws and regulations, it added.
""The development of China-Latin America ties does not target or reject any third party, nor does it affect the interests of third parties in Latin America,"" the ministry said.
""We hope that relevant countries abandon outdated concepts of zero-sum games and look at the development of China-Latin America relations in an open and inclusive manner.""
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Chile last month for a summit with Latin American and Caribbean countries, where he invited them to join China's massive Belt and Road infrastructure program.

Separately, the U.S. Treasury's top economic diplomat, David Malpass, on Friday accused China of enabling poor governance in Venezuela by propping up the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro through murky oil-for-loan investments.

RIYDAH - The global renown of billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal made his involuntary detention in early November at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel one of the biggest single shocks of Saudi Arabia’s anti-corruption crackdown.
The campaign, led by powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, swept up nearly 400 members of the kingdom's political and business elite. Authorities estimated financial settlements from the accused would net about $100 billion. 
In late January, a BBC broadcast featured a Canadian businessman who said he had spoken with the prince via video link and that the prince appeared to be sitting in jail rather than at the five-star hotel. Saudi Arabia’s authorities had converted the hotel into a luxury prison where hundreds of the kingdom’s wealthiest figures were being held. 
Reuters reached out to Saudi authorities for comment; they denied the allegations. Then, they invited us to see Prince Alwaleed at the Ritz for ourselves.
The interview was arranged within hours. At 1:00 a.m. on Jan. 27, a government car picked me up and drove me through the hotel's massive front gates. It was the first time I had seen them open in nearly three months.
After a brief wait and a tour of the hotel's empty facilities, I was escorted to an ornate sixth-floor suite where Prince Alwaleed was waiting.
Officials told me not to film outside the suite or catch any of them on camera. No conditions were placed on the interview itself.
The prince promptly took control, ushering me into the office and enthusiastically granting permission to film. The officials exited the room, leaving only the two of us throughout our 25-minute discussion.
Prince Alwaleed said he had been treated well during his time at the Ritz. 
He took a defiant stance on the accusations of corruption, saying that he was innocent and that he was certain he would emerge from the process in full control of his assets and his company, Kingdom Holding. 
It is impossible to know if Prince Alwaleed was truly free to speak his mind, given that he was still in detention as part of an extrajudicial legal process.
He appeared thin, but he was confident and upbeat, even making jokes as he took me on a tour of the suite. He smiled broadly and insisted that we take a photo together.
I recorded our exchange on my iPhone, propped up by a golden tissue box and a water bottle on his desk.
Hours later, the prince was released.

WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump expressed hope on Friday that ""something good"" could come from North Korea's participation in the Winter Olympics in South Korea, even after Pyongyang warned it would not ""sit idle"" if Washington and Seoul resumed military exercises after the Games.
Trump met North Korean defectors at the White House on Friday and said the Olympics could serve as an indicator as to whether the crisis over North Korea's development of nuclear weapons capable of hitting the United States could be resolved.
North Korea has not tested a missile since November and resumed inter-Korean dialogue in January, leading to agreement on its Olympics participation and easing tensions after a year of escalating rhetoric between Pyongyang and Washington.
""It’s a very tricky situation,"" Trump told reporters. ""We’re going to find out how it goes. We think the Olympics will go very nicely and after that, who knows.""
He said he was not trying to send a message to North Korea by meeting the defectors. ""They were here and I said 'let's tell your story'.""
Asked if there was more Washington could do to resolve the problem, Trump said his administration was doing a lot but its options were limited given concessions by previous presidents. 
""We ran out of road,"" he said. ""We have no road left. So we’ll see what happens, but in the meantime, we’ll get through the Olympics and maybe something good can come out of the Olympics. Who knows?""
The North-South talks, the first in two years, came after Washington and Seoul agreed to push back a routine military drill until after the Olympics and Paralympics. The Games begin next week and run until March 18.
In a letter to the United Nations published by North Korea's official news agency, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho warned against resuming the drills, which Pyongyang sees as practice for invasion.
He said that whenever the drills took place ""the peace and security of the Korean peninsula were gravely threatened and the inter-Korean mistrust and confrontation reached the top, thus creating great difficulties and obstacles ahead of hard-won dialogues"".
""We will make every effort to improve inter-Korean relations in future, too, but never sit idle with regard to sinister act of throwing a wet blanket over our efforts,"" Ri said.
He accused the United States of misleading public opinion by claiming that its pressure campaign, including ""their harshest sanctions"", had brought about the inter-Korean talks, when the ""dramatic turning point"" was thanks to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In a commentary on Friday, North Korea's state media said Washington was attempting to create a ""stage of confrontation"" at the Olympics by saying the inter-Korean talks and the positive results that had stemmed from them could ""disappear"" after the Games.
The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on the North Korean statement about the drills, but a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, Mike Cavey, said: ""The United States and our allies and partners in the region have long conducted routine exercises to maintain readiness. These exercises ensure we are trained for combined joint operations."" 
Trump's administration has warned that all options are on the table, including military ones, to resolve the crisis.
While it has repeatedly said it prefers a diplomatic solution, Trump has exchanged threats with Kim and U.S. officials have said the president and his advisers have discussed a preventative ""bloody nose"" strike on North Korea, alarming experts who warn that this could trigger catastrophic retaliation, especially on South Korea.
U.S. officials have said the debate on military action has lost some momentum as a result of the intra-Korean talks, which Trump has called a ""good thing"" and credited to his tough stance.
Joseph Yun, the U.S. special envoy on North Korea, said on Thursday he did not think the administration was close to triggering military action.
The White House said on Friday that Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe spoke by telephone and discussed an expanded missile defense system and other efforts to boost Japan's defenses amid the tensions over North Korea.
Trump also spoke to South Korean President Moon Jae-in about human rights in North Korea and trade between the United States and South Korea, the White House said.
South Korea's presidential Blue House said Moon had expressed hope that the momentum of improved North-South relation would go on and that U.S. Vice President Pence's visit ""would be an important prelude for that"".
North Korea criticized Pence's pending visit to the Olympics and accused Washington of halting improvements in inter-Korean relations.
Last month, a White House official said Pence planned to use his attendance to try to counter Kim Jong Un's efforts to ""hijack"" the games with a propaganda campaign.
Twenty-two North Korean athletes will compete in the Olympics, including 12 who will play in a unified women's ice hockey team. The other 10, including a figure skating pair, arrived in South Korea on Thursday.
North Korea has also agreed with South Korea to send a 230-strong cheering squad, as well as an orchestra and taekwondo performance team.

However, a joint cultural performance planned in a North Korean mountain resort was called off this week by Pyongyang, which blamed South Korean media for encouraging ""insulting"" public sentiment toward the North.

169,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 06:07PM ET</span>",German parties edge closer to coalition with migration deal,"By Thorsten Severin and Michelle Martin
BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and their would-be partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), have made major progress in talks on forming a coalition government but remain at odds on issues like labor rules, a senior SPD member said on Friday.
As he emerged from lengthy talks that Merkel hopes will ultimately secure her fourth term and end political impasse in Europe's largest economy, SPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil said the parties had taken a ""leap forward.""
""But we also saw that we have differences on some topics,"" he said.
Senior conservative Peter Altmaier said Friday's talks had been good and the parties were optimistic but a ""very tough stretch of road"" lay ahead.
The parties became embroiled in another dispute over migration on Friday, with some SPD members saying they wanted to revisit January's coalition blueprint that said the parties did not expect annual migration to exceed 220,000 per year because they were annoyed that Merkel's CSU Bavarian allies seemed to be considering this as an upper limit.
But SPD deputy Ralf Stegner later said the parties had reached a deal. In an apparent defeat for the SPD, the wording of that migration prediction remained the same - as pushed for by the CSU, which calls for a migrant cap.
Stegner said the figure described ""expected migration numbers"" and beyond that the parties stood by the right to asylum enshrined in Germany's constitution.
He said the SPD had to make compromises: ""We can't make progress on our issues without giving something in return.""
But he trumpeted an agreement on a ""modern and transparent immigration law"" as a success for the migrant-friendly SPD. The parties agreed to encourage skilled migration using criteria such as qualifications, age and language skills.
The two camps aim to finalize a deal for four more years of a ""grand coalition"" by the end of the weekend or early next week, some four months after an inconclusive election plunged Germany into unaccustomed political uncertainty.
But Merkel said, upon arriving for talks, that they faced divisions in crucial areas, adding: ""We have goodwill to overcome them, but there is still a lot of work ahead for us.""
The parties have agreed some eye-catching measures, including a 50 percent tax write-down for fleet electric cars and a 12-billion-euro public investment program to improve sluggish data networks, documents seen by Reuters showed.
In the field of labor rights, where the SPD wants to signal to its members that it has set its stamp on the deal, the SPD and conservatives agreed to the right for employees in companies with more than 45 employees to move seamlessly back and forth between full- and part-time work.
But long lines of text highlighted in yellow showed the parties had yet to decide on the exact wording of that agreement.
PROGRESS
Other agreements included to raise child benefits by 25 euros per child per month. Senior SPD member Katarina Barley said there would be a women's quota for management in the civil service after the last government focused on this for firms.
The parties also agreed to give German authorities the ability to deprive people with dual citizenship of their German citizenship if they fight abroad for an extremist organization.
They said they wanted to start allowing collective lawsuits. Consumer associations and politicians had called for class-action lawsuits to be made possible during the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) diesel emissions scandal.
As he arrived for talks, SPD leader Martin Schulz said his party would insist on more progress in labor law and healthcare, where the party hopes to reduce differences in the service experienced by the privately and publicly insured.
They made some progress by agreeing to boost funds for hospitals for restructuring, digitalization and new technologies.
The center-left SPD has sagged further in polls since suffering its worst postwar result in the Sept. 24 election.
Many SPD activists, who must ratify any coalition deal in a postal ballot, would prefer to see their party reinvent itself in opposition rather than join another coalition with Merkel after serving as junior partner from 2013 to 2017.

Several politicians from both blocs suggested they may need until Monday and Tuesday to reach an agreement, with Schulz stressing they were not under time pressure. But Horst Seehofer, Merkel's Bavarian ally, said: ""So far, there is no reason to expect we will need longer than Sunday.""

U.S. prosecutors said Peter Levashov, 37, ran the Kelihos botnet, a network of more than 100,000 infected devices used by cyber criminals to distribute viruses, ransomware, phishing emails and other spam attacks.
Levashov denies the charges in an eight-count indictment handed down by a federal grand jury in Connecticut in April.
Levashov, who fought the extradition, told Spain's High Court in September that he had worked for Russian President Vladimir Putin's United Russia party for the last 10 years, Russia's RIA news agency reported.
He told the court that investigators in the United States would torture him for information about his political work if he was sent there to face the charges, RIA said.
Levashov was charged by U.S. prosecutors with causing intentional damage to a protected computer and wire fraud, which carry a potential prison sentence of up to 52 years if he is convicted at trial.
He was arrested while on holiday in Barcelona last April and in October, Spain's High Court granted a U.S. request to extradite him. Levashov was scheduled to appear in court in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the Justice Department said.

171,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 05:41PM ET</span>","Exclusive: North Korea earned $200 million from banned exports, sends arms to Syria, Myanmar - U.N. report","By Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea violated United Nations sanctions to earn nearly $200 million in 2017 from banned commodity exports, according to a confidential report by independent U.N. monitors, which also accused Pyongyang of supplying weapons to Syria and Myanmar.
The report to a U.N. Security Council sanctions committee, seen by Reuters on Friday, said North Korea had shipped coal to ports, including in Russia, China, South Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam, mainly using false paperwork that showed countries such as Russia and China as the coal origin, instead of North Korea.
The 15-member council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, banning exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products. 
""The DPRK (North Korea) is already flouting the most recent resolutions by exploiting global oil supply chains, complicit foreign nationals, offshore company registries and the international banking system,"" the U.N. monitors wrote in the 213-page report. 
The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report. Russia and China have repeatedly said they are implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea.
SYRIA, MYANMAR 
The monitors said they had investigated ongoing ballistic missile cooperation between Syria and Myanmar, including more than 40 previously unreported North Korea shipments between 2012 and 2017 to Syria's Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which oversees the country's chemical weapons program.
The investigation has shown ""further evidence of arms embargo and other violations, including through the transfer of items with utility in ballistic missile and chemical weapons programs,"" the U.N. monitors wrote. 
They also inspected cargo from two North Korea shipments intercepted by unidentified countries en route to Syria. Both contained acid-resistant tiles that could cover an area equal to a large scale industrial project, the monitors reported. 
One country, which was not identified, told the monitors the seized shipments can ""be used to build bricks for the interior wall of a chemical factory.""
Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013. However, diplomats and weapons inspectors suspect Syria may have secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability.
The Syrian mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report. 
The U.N. monitors also said one country, which they did not identify, reported it had evidence that Myanmar received ballistic missile systems from North Korea, along with conventional weapons, including multiple rocket launchers and surface-to-air missiles. 
Myanmar U.N. Ambassador Hau Do Suan said the Myanmar government ""has no ongoing arms relationship, whatsoever, with North Korea"" and is abiding by the U.N. Security Council resolutions. 
BANNED EXPORTS, IMPORTS
Under a 2016 resolution, the U.N. Security Council capped coal exports and required countries to report any imports of North Korean coal to the council sanctions committee. It then banned all exports of coal by North Korea on Aug. 5.
The U.N. monitors investigated 16 coal shipments between January and Aug. 5 to ports in Russia, China, Malaysia and Vietnam. They said Malaysia reported one shipment to the council committee and the remaining 15 shipments violated sanctions.
After the coal ban was imposed on Aug. 5, the U.N. monitors investigated 23 coal shipments to ports in Russia, China, South Korea and Vietnam. The U.N. monitors said all those shipments ""would constitute a violation of the resolution, if confirmed.""
""The DPRK combined deceptive navigation patterns, signals manipulation, transshipments as well as fraudulent documentation to obscure the origin of the coal,"" the monitors said. 
The U.N. monitors ""also investigated cases of ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products in violation (of U.N. sanctions) ... and found that the network behind these vessels is primarily based in Taiwan province of China.""
The monitors said one country, which they did not name, told them North Korea had carried out such transfers off its ports of Wonsan and Nampo and in international waters between the Yellow Sea and East China Sea between October and January. 

The report said several multinational oil companies, which were not named, were also being investigated for roles in the supply chain of petroleum products transferred to North Korea.

MEXICO CITY/CARACAS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's first tour of Latin America got off to a rocky start on Friday with U.S. ally Mexico distancing itself from his suggestion that Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro could be toppled by his own military.
Tillerson ruffled feathers across the region on the eve of his five-nation tour with comments in Texas defending 19th century U.S. foreign policy in Latin America and suggesting the Venezuelan army could manage ""a peaceful transition"" from Maduro. 
Both Maduro and his defense minister condemned the comments on Friday, and even Mexico, no friend of the Venezuelan government, was at pains to say it did not support any non-peaceful solution in the South American country that is engulfed in a political and economic crisis. 
""Mexico, in no case, would back any option that implies the use of violence, internal or external, to resolve the case of Venezuela,"" Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray
said at a news conference, flanked by Tillerson and Canadian counterpart Chrystia Freeland.
""It will have to be the Venezuelans themselves who find a peaceful route, a peaceful solution to this crisis,"" he said.
Tillerson, in Mexico on the first leg of a trip that will also take in Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Jamaica, did not repeat his comments about military action, but reiterated a call for Maduro to reinstate a legislative assembly and hold free and fair elections. 
In Venezuela, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino accused Washington of seeking to undermine democracy in Latin America and return to the days of ""imperialism,"" lashing out at Tillerson during a broadcast on state television.
Padrino said Tillerson's Latin American tour was aimed at fomenting a regional ""intervention"" against Venezuela's socialist government.
""The armed forces radically reject such deplorable remarks that constitute a vile act of interference,"" he said, flanked by military top brass, before reading a formal statement of support for Maduro. 
At a political rally later in the day, Maduro said he would not be bowed by Tillerson's comments.
""We will not give in. They don't know what we are made of,"" Maduro said. 
CALLS FOR MILITARY ACTION 
Venezuela's opposition leaders have long urged the military to take action against Maduro. Maduro claims the United States and opposition parties are part of an international right-wing conspiracy to oust him and get their hands on the OPEC nation's oil wealth.
U.S. President Donald Trump has himself suggested possible military intervention in Venezuela, though that was widely rejected in Latin America. Trump has imposed individual and economic sanctions on Venezuela's government, accusing it of rights abuses and corruption.
On Thursday, Tillerson referred to the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, which is widely seen in Latin America as a justification for U.S. armed intervention in the region, saying it was ""as relevant today as it was the day it was written.""
Discussing Venezuela, the top U.S. diplomat said militaries in Latin America often ""handled"" transitions from bad governments, but insisted he was not advocating ""regime change.""
""If the kitchen gets a little too hot for him, I am sure that he's got some friends over in Cuba that could give him a nice hacienda on the beach and he could have a nice life over there,"" Tillerson said, referring to 55-year-old Maduro, who has a close relationship with Cuba's communist government.
Senior military leaders have consistently stood by Maduro, whom critics accuse of turning Venezuela into a dictatorship and wrecking its economy. 
But discontent among the rank-and-file, especially at their own economic penuries, is evident. 

There have been some small uprisings against Maduro from within the security forces. A National Guard captain led an attack on a barracks but was later arrested. A police helicopter pilot, Oscar Perez, who lobbed grenades at government buildings, was tracked down and killed last month.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A man from Russia's Muslim Dagestan region has been charged with links to an illegal armed group, a court official in Dagestan said, years after he began helping families persuade sons recruited by Islamic State to renounce the militants and leave Syria.
Kazim Nurmagomedov, 63, was detained in Moscow on Wednesday and transferred to Dagestan where he was formally arrested on Thursday on charges of assisting in a crime related to an illegal armed group in Russia or abroad, the official confirmed. 
Nurmagomedov has gained prominence by dissuading young men from joining Islamic State and helping families persuade their sons to leave the group's ranks in Syria. He also helped his own son Marat quit Islamic State and leave Syria.
Marat, 33, told Reuters in July from Ukraine that he had joined Islamic State in 2013, but two years later had changed his mind. 
He walked across the Syrian border into Turkey and finally settled in Ukraine, he said, slipping in unnoticed thanks to a breakdown in intelligence-sharing between Moscow and Kiev after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.
Everyone in the family had tried to convince Marat, who told Reuters that he had now renounced violent Islamism, to leave Islamic State. 
But Marat's brother Shamil, a businessman in the Moscow region, was arrested for sending money to help him get out of Syria and charged with financing terrorism.
On Wednesday, Kazim Nurmagomedov was detained as he was leaving Shamil's trial in Moscow, which is still going on, another of his sons, Imagadji, told Reuters. 
""Naturally, he (Kazim Nurmagomedov) denies he is guilty,"" Imagadji said.
Denis Sokolov, an expert on the northern Caucasus region, said that Kazim appeared to have been arrested at least in part because he had gained prominence with his attempts to dissuade others from joining IS, throwing a spotlight on an issue that might be uncomfortable to Russian authorities.
He said Kazim had befriended many families and encouraged or helped them to try to bring home children who had gone to join Islamic State.
""I don't know anyone else who has extracted that many people from Islamic State, or stopped such a large number from going to join them in the first place,"" Sokolov said.
The official at the court in Dagestan declined to comment further on the charges against Kazim.

Earlier this week Sisi said additional steps would be taken against anyone looking to upset Egypt's security and warned that the protests of seven years ago, which toppled longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak in 2011, would never happen again.
In a rare public rebuke of Sisi's own remarks, the Civil Democratic Movement called the speech an attempt ""to spread fear among Egyptian voters"" which ""undermines ... the integrity of the electoral competition"".
Former military commander Sisi was elected in 2014, a year after leading the army to the ousting of Islamist President Mohamed Mursi. He is expected to easily win a vote slated for March 26-28.
The Civil Democratic Movement includes several notable figures, including a former presidential contender as well as Hesham Genena, a former anti-corruption watchdog head who had been campaigning for former military chief of staff Sami Anan, Sisi's top opponent before he was arrested. 
The statement follows growing calls to boycott the March vote after all major opposition campaigns withdrew citing intimidation. Anan himself was arrested and halted his presidential bid after the army accused him of breaking the law by running for office without permission.
Sisi now faces a single opponent, who is himself a Sisi supporter, in the March contest. 
""Clearing the political space of candidates in the name of preserving security is unconstitutional and does not promote security,"" the statement said.
Sisi said in the speech that he may call on Egyptians to take to the streets to give him a ""mandate"" in the face of what he described as ""villains,"" without specifying who he meant.
""We affirm that states are not run by mandates and the mobilization of supporters in orchestrated gatherings, but rather by constitutions and respect for freedoms,"" the statement said.

""Is this a mandate in order to uphold freedoms? Or to crush opposition? Or to violate the constitution?"" it said.

Speaking in Mexico City, Tillerson said European counterparts had noticed that Russia had its fingerprints on a number of elections. 
""We hear this from our European counterparts,"" Tillerson said. ""My advice would be ... pay attention to what's happening.""
His comments followed remarks late last year by U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, who said there was already evidence of Russian meddling in Mexican elections set for July.
McMaster did not give details of the alleged interference. 
Tillerson made no reference to alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election won by President Donald Trump. That involvement included people in Russia buying 3,000 U.S. political ads and placing 80,000 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts seen by 126 million Americans over two years, Facebook has said.
U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. campaign, including whether there was any collusion between Trump's team and Moscow.
Russia denies that it intervened in the election.
The country led by Vladimir Putin has also been accused of intervening in votes in Italy, Finland, Britain and France, among others.
Mexico holds presidential and congressional elections on July 1 and so far the frontrunner in almost all polls is left-wing former Mexico City Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
An aide to presidential hopeful Jose Antonio Meade, hoping to run for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), warned in January that Russia could try to benefit Lopez Obrador. 

Lopez Obrador has made light of the allegation and has since taken to wearing a jacket embroidered with the name ""Andres Manuelovich"".

Ramadan, who denies the allegations, took temporary leave in November from his post at Britain's University of Oxford.
He vowed to sue for slander two women whose rape accusations prompted a preliminary judicial inquiry.
Friday's announcement turned that preliminary inquiry into a full, open-ended investigation where French magistrates stated goal is to establish whether Ramadan should stand trial.
In France, the launch of a full investigation implies that initial findings justify further pursuit in the view of the investigating magistrates but does not mean the matter is sure to go to trial.
Ramadan is a grandson of Hasan al-Banna, an Islamist thinker and activist who founded the Muslim Brotherhood. He enjoys a substantial following among young Muslims and has challenged French restrictions on wearing veils. 
Police arrested him and took him into custody earlier this week in France.

Turkey launched an air and ground offensive last month against Kurdish fighters who control the northwest Syrian region of Afrin on the Turkish border, opening a new front in Syria's multi-sided war now approaching its eighth year. 
The Kurdish-led administration of northeast Syria said Barin Kobane, a fighter with the Kurdish YPJ militia, was killed by Turkey-backed rebels who ""played with her corpse and cut it up"" as cameras rolled. The YPJ is the all-female affiliate of the Kurdish YPG militia.

The video has caused anger amongst the Kurdish population of northern Syria, a witness said. Memorial pictures of her are being circulated widely on social media. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said she was killed during fighting in the north of the Afrin region near the Turkish border where Turkey-backed forces have taken some territory since launching its operation last month.
Kobane - her nom de guerre - was in her mid-twenties and joined the YPJ in 2015, a YPG official said. He said she was killed alongside three other fighters near the town of Bulbul.

181,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 02:37PM ET</span>",U.S. Treasury accuses China of aiding Maduro in murky deals,"By Lesley Wroughton and David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury's top economic diplomat, David Malpass, on Friday accused China of enabling poor governance in Venezuela by propping up the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro through murky oil-for-loan investments.
In a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Malpass said China's focus on commodities and opaque financing deals had hurt, not helped, countries in the region.
His attack on China's role in aiding the Venezuelan government came a day after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, ahead of a five-day tour of Latin America, raised the prospect of a Venezuelan military coup.
The Trump administration has imposed individual and economic sanctions on Venezuela’s government for rights abuses and corruption. Maduro has accused Washington of seeking to oust him to improve access to the OPEC nation's oil wealth.
Malpass, Treasury's under secretary for international affairs, said Venezuela's economic crisis and lack of democratic rule were among the ""biggest disappointments and disasters"" of the region. Washington and the opposition blame Maduro's policies.
""Most of the blame for Venezuela's economic collapse and humanitarian disaster falls squarely on Venezuela's rulers, but China has been by far Venezuela's largest lender supporting poor governance,"" Malpass said.
He said the international community and Venezuela's people would ultimately be left with rebuilding the country once democracy was restored.
""China denominated many of its loans to Venezuela in barrels of oil,"" said Malpass. ""This has the effects of masking the exact amount of payments that China made to Venezuelan officials and that Venezuelans are expected to make to China in the future,"" he added.
Cooperation between China and the region was based on common interests and mutual needs, the Xhinhua state news agency said quoting the Chinese foreign ministry, and investments are in line with local laws.
""China is a major international buyer of Latin American bulk commodities, and imports more and more agricultural and high value-added products from the region,"" Xhinhua reported, quoting spokesperson Hua Chunying.
China has said it is confident in Venezuela's ability to properly handle its debts. Venezuela has borrowed billions of dollars from Russia and China, primarily through oil-for-loan deals that have crimped the country's hard currency revenue by requiring oil shipments to be used to service those loans.
Since 2007 China has loaned more than $50 billion to Venezuela through an oil-for-loans arrangement that helped Caracas reduce reliance on U.S. energy markets. But the flow of funds from Beijing has slowed since 2014, when abundant crude oil led to a crash in oil markets and made China less interested in maintaining its alliance with Venezuela. 
Malpass also expressed concern at a decision by the Washington-based Inter-American Development Bank, the biggest lender to the region, to hold its 2019 annual meeting in China, saying the gathering should be held in the Americas.
""The Bank's 60th anniversary is an important milestone to celebrate the Bank's accomplishments ... and it would be fitting to hold the meeting in the hemisphere among major donors and borrowers,"" Malpass said.

The IADB did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Malpass criticism.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is concerned about the potential use of sarin gas in Syria, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday, a day after Washington warned it was prepared to consider military action if necessary to deter chemical weapons attacks by the Syrian government.
Mattis, speaking with reporters, said the Syrian government had repeatedly used chlorine as a weapon. He stressed that the United States did not have evidence of sarin gas use.
""We are even more concerned about the possibility of sarin use, (but) I don't have the evidence,"" Mattis said. ""What I am saying is that other groups on the ground - NGOs, fighters on the ground - have said that sarin has been used, so we are looking for evidence.""
Mattis did not provide further details on which reports on the use of sarin he was referring to. 
However, the Syrian Negotiations Commission (SNC), an opposition group, said chemical weapons had been used by the government of Bashar al-Assad in Ghouta.
Rescue workers and medical groups working in the rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, have accused government forces of using chlorine gas three times over the last month, including early on Thursday.
""Chemical weapons are being used in Ghouta and we have proof,"" SNC spokesman Yahya al-Aridi told Reuters.
A deadly sarin attack on another rebel-held area in April 2017 prompted President Donald Trump to order a U.S. missile strike on the Shayrat airbase, from which the Syrian operation is said to have been launched.
""We are on the record and you all have seen how we reacted to that, so they would be ill-advised to go back to violating the chemical (weapons) convention,"" Mattis said.
France said on Friday it was ""deeply concerned"" that Syria's government was flouting its pledges to stop using chemical weapons and Paris was working with its partners to shed light on recent suspected toxic gas attacks.
In 2013, Syria said it would give up all of its chemical weapons. In the past two years, a joint United Nations and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inquiry found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin and several times used chlorine as a weapon.
U.S. officials have said the Syrian government may be also developing new types of chemical weapons.

The Syrian army and government have consistently denied using chlorine or other chemical weapons during the war and has said it cooperates with international investigations.

183,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>","Britain, EU schedule week of Brexit talks, eye future","By Jan Strupczewski and Alastair Macdonald
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British and European Union negotiators will spend all next week in talks on Brexit, culminating in their first formal discussion of what their future relationship will look like after Britain has left the EU.
A schedule posted by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Twitter on Friday confirmed he will meet his opposite number, Brexit Secretary David Davis, in London on Monday for the first time since EU leaders gave him instructions to agree a post-Brexit transition to ease Britain's departure.
After interim accords in December on key parts of the divorce terms, EU leaders agreed to launch talks on the transition and the future relationship. 
EU officials expect a faster pace to negotiations compared to the roughly monthly rounds of talks lasting 2-3 days each time that was the norm last year. Both sides hope to conclude a deal on a transition in time for EU leaders to endorse it at a Brussels summit on March 22-23. 
Though not legally binding unless and until it forms part of an overall withdrawal treaty, leaders hope a transition deal can calm nerves among investors. 
Negotiating teams will hold the first technical talks in Brussels from Tuesday to Thursday on what a transition may look like, notably which courts might enforce the treaty and further discussions on avoiding a disruptive ""hard"" border with Ireland.
On Friday, Barnier and Davis's top officials, Sabine Weyand and Oliver Robbins, will meet in Brussels to wrap up progress made during the week.
The British side will also offer an ""update on the future relationship"", according to Barnier. 
A British official said they would not reveal details of trade proposals; Prime Minister Theresa May has caused some frustration in Brussels by failing to do that so far, although she is expected to lay out her trade ideas in the coming weeks.
Rather, the British official said, Friday's session would focus on areas where London has already declared its preferred outcomes, such as a close relationship in security matters and a ""customs partnership"".
TRANSITION DEAL
Declared positions on both sides suggest little room for dispute, although May has rejected an EU demand that EU citizens who take up residence in Britain even after Brexit, but before the end of the transition, should enjoy the same lifetime rights which London agreed to grant to those who arrive before Brexit.
That has raised the prospect of delay, but May insisted on Friday that the transition deal would be done within seven weeks -- in time for the March EU summit.
The EU has offered Britain a status quo transition until the end of 2020 after Brexit. But there is disagreement inside May's Conservative Party over the citizens' rights issue and the scope of European Court of Justice jurisdiction during the transition.
Of more concern to some in Brussels is the continued lack of clarity on how Britain sees a free trade deal working. 
EU leaders want to be able to agree instructions for their negotiators when they meet on March 22-23 so that trade talks can start in the weeks after that. But once May has revealed her demands it will take the EU some weeks to prepare those plans.
If they cannot meet the deadline of the March summit, the start of trade talks could be pushed back, possibly even beyond the next formal EU summit in late June, jeopardizing hopes of having an outline trade accord ready by the end of the year.
""We still expect to be able to have the trade guidelines for the March summit,"" one senior EU official said. ""But Theresa May is being so discreet. If she doesn't say what she wants, we may not be able to prepare our position in time."" 
An EU diplomat involved in Brexit talks said: ""It’s for them to tell us what they want. If they don't do it in a timely manner, they would be shooting themselves in the foot again.""

BOLOGNA, Italy (Reuters) - Italy's ruling center-left Democratic Party (PD), trailing in opinion polls ahead of a March 4 ballot, said on Friday it would help families, boost pensions and introduce a minimum wage if it won re-election.
Former prime minister Matteo Renzi accused his rivals of making unrealistic promises as he unveiled the PD's 100-point election manifesto, which was strongly pro-Europe and included pledges to cut Italy's debt mountain and boost growth.
""We propose 100 small steps forward for Italy, 100 small, concrete measures, achievable goals,"" Renzi said in the northern city of Bologna in a hall packed with party bigwigs.
Opinion polls predict that a center-right alliance that includes Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party will win next month's vote, with a combined score of around 37 percent -- not enough to control parliament. 
The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement looks set to emerge as the largest single party, on around 28 percent. The PD is seen on around 23 percent, paying the price for internal schisms and the slow pace of economic recovery.
The center-right is promising to introduce a flat-tax of just 23 percent for individuals and companies if it wins, while the 5-Star says it will introduce a ""universal wage"" of up to 780 euros ($973) a month to alleviate growing poverty.
Renzi said such measures were unsustainable. ""It seems that the political debate is not focused on real issues. We, instead, have put pragmatism at center stage,"" he said.
PRO-EUROPEAN
Amongst the PD's flagship proposals was a pledge to give families 400 euros a month per infant for three years to help with childcare costs and allow tax deductions of 240 euros per child until they turned 18.
It also vowed to cut the corporate tax rate to 22 percent from 24 percent and drop social security contributions on wages to 29 percent from 33 percent. A minimum wage would be introduced, it said, without giving details.
The PD additionally promised to set the minimum pension at 750 euros after at least 20 years of contributions, from around 500 euros at present. Forza Italia is promising to hike the minimum pension to 1,000 euros.
The PD did not say how it would pay for its various proposals, but said it expected economic output would rise to 2 percent a year against some 1.5 percent at present, suggesting it was betting on an increase in overall tax revenues. 
It envisaged lowering the debt mountain from 132 percent of gross domestic product -- the highest in Europe after Greece -- to 100 percent over a 10-year period and said it would respect the EU's budget deficit ceiling of three percent of GDP.
While opposition parties have been highly critical of the European Union, threatening fierce clashes over budget rigor, the PD presented itself as fervently pro-European.
As such, it said it wanted a eurozone economy minister appointed, the introduction of joint eurobonds to finance the single currency bloc and the direct election by voters across the continent of the European Commission president.
By the same token, a PD government would demand a halt to EU funding for countries like Hungary and Poland that were refusing to take in some of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have reached Italy from Africa over the past four years.
""Our Europe is one of values, culture and the rule of law,"" said the PD's Sandro Gozi, European affairs minister.

The Associated Press has reported it had confirmed the existence of more than five previously unreported mass graves in the village of Gu Dar Pyin, through interviews with survivors in refugee camps in Bangladesh and through time-stamped cellphone videos.
The Myanmar government's Information Committee, part of the office of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, said in a statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that local authorities and security officials formed a ""ground team"" that investigated the report.
""The ground team went to the locations that were mentioned in the AP news story as where the bodies were buried and found out that it is not true,"" the statement said. 
""Besides, they met with local elders and villagers and asked whether there were mass killings or not and the villagers told them that there were none.""
The statement said, however, that 19 ""terrorists"" had been killed when they attacked security forces in the village in late August and that their bodies had been ""properly buried"".
Two Rohingya residents, who were still in the village and spoke to Reuters by telephone, disputed the government's statement and said that there were mass graves there. They said senior military officers visited the area on Friday, took photographs and held a meeting with the villagers.
The residents, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisal, were speaking by telephone to a Reuters reporter at the Balukhali refugee camp in Bangladesh. The reporter was put in touch with them by former residents who have fled Rakhine.
One resident said his father attended the meeting, where officers asked how many people had been killed in the violence, who burned their houses and whether there were mass graves there.
""The villagers were frightened and said they didn't know how many had died or who had burned their houses but said, yes, there are mass graves here,"" the resident said.
Another resident of the village said three senior military officials arrived late in the morning, took pictures of a mass grave beside his house and then called a meeting at the school.
""The senior officials are gone now but a large group of military men stayed behind and the villagers are scared,"" the resident said.
Suu Kyi's spokesman referred requests for comment on the villagers' description of events to the Rakhine state government. A spokesman from the state government was not immediately available. The military said it had no immediate comment.
Reporters are not allowed access to the area, in the north of Rakhine state. The army launched a sweeping counteroffensive there in response to Rohingya militant attacks on Aug. 25.
The United Nations has condemned the army's campaign as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar denies that, saying its forces were carrying out legitimate counterinsurgency operations.
The military has acknowledged that Buddhist villagers and soldiers killed 10 people it described as captured Muslim terrorists and buried them in a grave in the village of Inn Din in early September. It has said action will be taken against those responsible.

Macron was attending a financing conference of the Global Partnership for Education, which seeks to ensure access to classrooms for 870 million children in 65 developing countries. 
""The risk of terrorism that we have lived through ... that convinces children that their future is war ... the risk of seeing actual human bombs continue to deploy in our societies, there's only one answer,"" he said. 
France has been a target of militant violence, including attacks in Paris in 2015 that killed more than 130 people, and is engaged in the fight against Islamist fighters in Africa.
It has deployed troops as part of a regional operation in West Africa's arid Sahel band. Paris is also supporting a new multinational force created by regional governments to take on Islamist groups, some of whom are linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State, operating in the area. 
Several West African leaders were in the audience as Macron gave his speech on Friday. 
Ensuring that children were able to attend school, Macron said, would combat fundamentalist movements, including those seeking to repress women and girls and remove them from public life. 
However, he said France had work to do to improve education at home. ""We have an education problem today when a fifth of children cannot write, read or count well when they arrive at the age of 12 years,"" he said.
He said developed countries around the world were struggling with the fear created by vast societal changes brought on by technological advances and disruption.
""Without education, what is the response? Retreat. Hatred of others. A revival of nationalism and everything we have survived and thought we'd vanquished during the 20th century,"" he said.

The Partnership is seeking $3.1 billion in financing to fund its activities over the coming three years.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Nicaragua was ordered by the UN's top court on Friday to remove a military base from Costa Rican territory in a ruling seeking to end a decade-long dispute between the Central American neighbors.
Judges at the International Court of Justice found that Costa Rica has sovereignty over the ""whole northern part of Isla Portillas, including the coast"", but excluding Harbour Head Lagoon.
As part of the settlement, the court drew a new maritime boundary between the states, who have had rival claims since 2002, when Nicaragua published maps detailing oil concessions, some of which were in waters claimed by Costa Rica.
Costa Rica had filed the suit in 2014, asking the court to determine its borders with Nicaragua in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean.
In a separate case heard at the court earlier Friday, Nicaragua was ordered by the UN's top court on Friday to pay its neighbor Costa Rica nearly $379,000 dollars in reparations for environmental damage to parts of its wetlands.

The court said Costa Rica should be compensated for the damage caused, the cost of environmental restoration, expenses and interest. The amount must be paid by April 2.

The Washington-based Center for American Progress said that figure was based on analysis of U.S. government data that showed 50,133 guns recovered in criminal investigations across 15 countries between 2014 and 2016 originated in the United States. 
The report, titled Beyond Our Borders, said weak U.S. laws were contributing to trafficking of firearms from the United States into countries suffering from violent gangs such as Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras.
Mexico's murder rate jumped to the highest in more than two decades of modern records last year, according to official government data issued last month.
Mexico's legal market for guns is tightly restricted but the number of murders committed there with a gun rose from 15 percent in 1997 to roughly 66 percent in 2017, the Center for American Progress said in an analysis of that data.
Some 70 percent of 106,001 guns recovered in Mexico and submitted for tracing from 2011 to 2016 were originally bought in the United States, the report said, citing data from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
Mexico has asked the United States to do more to fight gun trafficking but experts have criticized officials on both sides of the border for a lack of cooperation and failing to stem the flow of guns south.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson landed in Mexico City on Thursday to speak with Mexican government and security officials and on Friday he was meeting with the foreign ministers of Mexico and Canada.

A ninth suspect was killed during the operation to round up the group, they said.
Soon after the blast on Thursday night, authorities had reported the explosion took place in the gas boiler room of a tax office in the Cukurambar district.
But after investigating security footage, police said a man had placed a bag they believe contained explosives at the entrance to the building, the governor's office said in a statement on Friday.
It said eight people, including the man believed to have planted the explosives, had been detained in four separate provinces. The suspect who was killed had entered Turkey illegally and received training from a branch of the Syrian Kurdish PYD group, the governor's office said.
Turkey considers the YPG, the armed wing of the PYD, to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which has waged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast.
Turkey's military launched an incursion into northern Syria's Afrin region against the U.S.-backed YPG militia two weeks ago.
Ankara Governor Ercan Topaca said three people had sustained light injuries from flying debris at the scene of Thursday's explosion.

Mehmet Dogan, 60, is one of nine people detained by Greece's anti-terrorism service in November, weeks before Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's visit to Greece in December. 
The court said on Friday Dogan, although still being held in Greece, had been granted political asylum in France. He told the court this week he had gone to France in 2011, after being held for 20 years in prison in Turkey, a court official said. 
""He has already been recognized as a refugee in France ... therefore he cannot be sent back to Turkey, where his life is in danger according to former rulings,"" the official said.
Later on Friday, Turkey said the decision had ""caused great disappointment,"" and accused Greek courts of protecting terrorists and acting in a way that ""does not befit neighboring behavior."" 
""We expect the Greek judiciary to make decisions away from political pressures and in accordance with the law in the coming period,"" Turkey's foreign ministry said in a statement.
The nine detained have been charged in Greece with setting up and belonging to a criminal organization, terrorist-related acts of supplying explosive materials, and with illegal possession of firearms, smoke bombs and firecrackers.
All have all denied those charges, saying in a statement in December: ""Solidarity with people who are fighting for their rights and freedom is not terrorism.""
Dogan is also wanted in Turkey over alleged links to a far-left group blamed for attacks and suicide bombings there since 1990. His lawyers told the Greek court he had been sentenced to three years in prison in Turkey in the case.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stripped of his Bahraini citizenship and living in London exile, rights activist Sayed Ahmed AlWadaei says he speaks for the hundreds of opposition figures made voiceless by imprisonment back home.
Drawing on a network of activists, contacts, relatives of detainees and legal records, he publishes prolifically on developments in the Gulf island monarchy, an ally of the United States and Britain.
Scores of Bahraini exiles and dissidents live in London, but none campaigns more energetically against their native country's crackdown on its critics. 
Authorities in Bahrain tend to call such people - including AlWadaei himself - terrorists.
He says members of his own family have been detained and tortured in Bahrain in a bid to pressure him into silence.
""It's crystal clear in my mind that the moment I stop my work, the reprisals against my family will stop,"" AlWadaei, 31, told Reuters in an interview from the offices of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) in central London.
""It's a matter of, will I allow them to break my will, will I allow them to break me by using those harsh tactics? Or will I make it costly for them, for their reputation and their partners to be associated with corrupt human rights abusers?"" he said. 
BIRD, which employs several British campaigners, receives funding from the U.S.-based National Endowment for Democracy and a UK foundation, the Sigrid Rausing Trust.
He seeks to shine a light on prison conditions and trials of detainees, such as the case of a mass sentencing on weapons charges this week of 58 people to penalties ranging from death to loss of citizenship. He decried it as a ""travesty of justice"".
Bahrain, whose ruling family is Sunni Muslim, has seen sporadic unrest since 2011 when authorities crushed protests, mainly by the Shi'ite majority, demanding a bigger role in running the country.
AlWadaei was detained for taking part in the 2011 rallies. He accuses police of beating him and his jailers of torture and sexual harassment. He points to a large scar on his forehead.
Authorities accuse him of incitement to terrorism aimed at overthrowing Bahrain's monarchy. 
""DEMOCRACY VERSUS DICTATORSHIP""
In a response to a Reuters request for comment on AlWadaei's accusations, a government spokesman said any allegations of abuses by security forces could be referred to an ombudsman and independently investigated.
The government says his mother-in-law and brother-in-law were sentenced in a fair trial to three years in jail in October for planting a ""fake bomb"" meant to taunt police.
""No one can be charged or prosecuted solely because of their family relations,"" the government added.
AlWadaei believes the case against his relatives was motivated by his human rights work and especially a protest in which he took part in 2016 against the attendance of Bahrain's king at a royal horse show in Britain.
A tiny country lying between regional arch-rivals Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran, Bahrain is a key ally of Riyadh and the West. 
It hosts the U.S.'s Fifth Fleet and soon also a new British naval base, its first permanent military presence in the Middle East since it withdrew from Bahrain and the rest of the Gulf region in 1971.
The government, citing years of deadly bombing and shooting attacks against its security forces, says it faces a militant threat backed by Tehran.
""They blame the situation on Iran to make it seem more of a sectarian problem rather than democracy versus dictatorship, which is the main context in Bahrain,"" AlWadaei said.
He says his wife was detained and interrogated about his activities and movements as she and their young son were departing Bahrain's airport to join AlWadaei in London.
The Bahraini government said she was not mistreated and dismissed AlWadaei's accusations as ""unsubstantiated.""
Because AlWadaei's application process for ""indefinite leave to remain"" in Britain had not been decided by the time of his daughter's birth last year, she has been rendered stateless like him for the time being. 
Despite such challenges, he vows not to relent.
""I ... feel more determined that this injustice should stop, and no one, no human on earth, should be tortured or have his family go through reprisals simply because they stood up for human rights.""

195,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 11:46AM ET</span>",Afghan president demands Pakistan act against Taliban,"KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Friday accused neighboring Pakistan of failing to move against the Taliban and pledged a new security plan for Kabul after hundreds of people were killed and wounded in two deadly attacks on the capital last month.
Afghanistan has long accused Pakistan of aiding terrorists by giving shelter and aid to leaders of the Taliban insurgency, a charge denied by Pakistan, which points to the thousands of its own citizens killed by militant violence over the years.
""We are waiting for Pakistan to act,"" Ghani said in a televised address after weekly prayers, in which he accused Pakistan of being the ""Taliban center"".
A recent attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul and a suicide bombing on a crowded city street a week later have stoked public anger in Afghanistan and stepped up pressure on Ghani's Western-backed government to improve security.
The attacks, which killed more than 130 people and wounded hundreds more, were claimed by the Taliban, which is fighting to drive out international troops and re-establish its form of strict Islamic law in Afghanistan.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told Ghani in a telephone call on Friday that the attacks ""highlight the barbarity and cowardice of the insurgency, and strengthen America’s resolve to support Afghanistan"" and its government, the White House said.
Afghan and U.S. officials say the Haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the Taliban and believed to be based in Pakistan, was responsible.
A Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman said Pakistan and Afghanistan were both victims of terrorism and needed to work together to fight the common threat.
""Pakistan affirms solidarity with the people and government of Afghanistan in fighting the menace of terrorism,"" he said in a statement. ""We feel the pain of our Afghan brothers and sisters."" 
Pakistan had taken strong action to counter terrorism, including operations against Haqqani network camps in mountainous Waziristan.
Ghani said 11 arrests had been made and a list of individuals Kabul believed to be behind the attacks as well as the networks that supported them was given to Pakistani authorities.
""The attack is not against our men, women or children but against the Afghan nation and it requires a national, comprehensive response,"" Ghani said, adding that security officials would present a new plan on Sunday.
But it was unclear what steps would be taken to improve the last major security plan in Kabul, which established a string of extra checkpoints and heavy vehicle controls after a truck bomb killed 150 people in the city last May.
Pakistan's embassy in Kabul said on Thursday that officials in Islamabad were assessing the evidence presented during a visit by Afghan Interior Minister Wais Barmak and the head of the NDS intelligence service, Masoom Stanekzai. It said Pakistan had given no commitment to take any action.

The attacks came at a time of heightened tension in the region, after the United States said it would cut security aid to Pakistan, complaining the South Asian nation was not doing enough to fight terrorist groups sheltering there.

But new President Emmerson Mnangagwa - keen to boost the economy and mend ties with countries that imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe - has said he wants to end discrimination between black and white farmers and is working to compensate those who lost their properties.

""It's also something which is very important as a signal to international investors and so it's important and we welcome the fact that the president has made a commitment in terms of continuing with that process.""
Zimbabwe sees mending relations with former colonial ruler Britain as a critical step towards re-establishing ties with the West and international financial institutions.

Under Mugabe, the government argued that it would only pay for buildings and equipment on farms but not the land, which it said had been expropriated from locals during the colonial era.
Mugabe, who was forced to step down after a de facto military coup in November, argued that Britain should pay compensation for the land because the farmers were its ""kith and kin"".
When asked whether Britain would help pay the farmers, Baldwin said she welcomed ""the statements that the president has made on that front"". She did not elaborate.
Land ownership is a highly sensitive topic in Zimbabwe. Colonialists seized some of the best agricultural land and much of it remained in the hands of white farmers after independence in 1980, while many blacks were landless.
The government has said it will issue 99-year leases to white farmers, according to a government circular.

Earlier this month a government document showed that Zimbabwe was considering establishing a special tribunal to determine the value of compensation and how to pay it to white farmers who have lost land since 2000.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya on Friday defied a court order to lift a ban on three private television stations and briefly detained an opposition politician, deepening a crisis sparked by a disputed presidential election.
The media crackdown, criticized by the United Nations, the United States and former colonial power Britain, could set up a showdown between the judiciary and the executive next week.
On Tuesday, opposition leader Raila Odinga symbolically inaugurated himself as president in a direct challenge to President Uhuru Kenyatta. The government responded by shutting down three television channels planning to stream the event. 
On Thursday, activist Okiya Omtatah won a court order saying the channels should be reopened. But when he tried to serve it to Kenya's communications authority on Friday, they refused to receive it. Other officials given the order ignored it. 
If the government continues to defy the courts, it could spark a confrontation with a newly-confident judiciary, said Murithi Mutiga, senior analyst with International Crisis Group.
The Supreme Court infuriated Kenyatta last year when it found irregularities in the August presidential election and annulled his victory. 
The court ordered a re-run. Odinga boycotted the repeat poll in October, saying the process was rigged, and Kenyatta won with 98 percent of the vote. This time, legal challenges were thrown out.
TEST OF THE CONSTITUTION
""Next week will be a litmus test for the constitution,"" said Mutiga. ""If the government does not comply with a court order that is so clear, it will raise questions as to the wider rule of law.""
Omtatah, the activist, said men in dark suits who said they were police but refused to provide identification had detained a courier he sent to deliver the judgment to Kenya's communications authority. 
""They released him at 10 with a stern warning not to come back,"" he told Reuters by phone ""I have come here myself, but I am being been denied access."" 
He pasted the order on the gate of the authority, but the men tore it down, he said. 
The court order was also published in Friday's edition of the Standard newspaper, one of Kenya's largest dailies. Omtatah said he had also delivered it to the internal security minister, attorney general and information minister.
""I am insisting on delivering this order,"" he said. 
Omtatah said he would return to court on Monday. Government officials refused to comment on whether they would appeal.
The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva said it was concerned at the government's ""attempts to interfere with the rights to freedom of expression"".
OPPOSITION LEADER DETAINED
Also on Friday, firebrand opposition politician Miguna Miguna was detained in a dawn raid on his Nairobi home and later released on bail of 50,000 Kenyan shillings ($500), his lawyer Nelson Havi told Reuters.
Miguna stood beside Odinga at Tuesday's rally and declared himself the ""general"" of Odinga's National Resistance Movement, which authorities designated a ""criminal group"" this week because of its stated intent to establish a parallel government.
On Thursday another opposition leader who attended Tuesday's rally was arrested. He was also released on bail.
The arrests and broadcast bans have shocked Kenyans used to the freewheeling media and irreverent political culture that have taken root since the end of decades of autocratic rule in 2002.
The crackdown has focused attention on government censorship and away from the opposition's failure to release a promised statement outlining its next move.
Western diplomats say Odinga's inauguration event has caused splits within his own alliance and alienated the diplomatic community.
""So you inaugurate yourself - then what?"" asked one. ""It's a dead end - where do you go from there?""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration attacked Hezbollah's financial network on Friday by imposing sanctions on six people and seven entities in an effort to turn back Iran's influence in the Middle East and beyond.
""The administration is determined to expose and disrupt Hezbollah's networks, including those across the Middle East and West Africa, used to fund their illicit operations,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in announcing the penalties under financial regulations targeting the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group.
The six sanctioned individuals included five Lebanese and one Iraqi, most of them linked to Al-Inmaa Engineering and Contracting, the Treasury Department said. The seven entities were firms based in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Lebanon and Ghana, the statement said.
Senior Trump administration officials said the sanctions were part of an aggressive move against Hezbollah to try to limit the influence of Iran, which gives the group about $700 million a year to help finance its activities.
The officials, briefing reporters at the White House on condition of anonymity, said the Trump administration was working to reverse what it considers a more lackadaisical approach toward Hezbollah by Democratic President Barack Obama after the 2015 Iran nuclear deal went into effect.
More such targeted sanctions are expected in the months ahead, they said.
The officials said Hezbollah was already under financial strain as it continued to pay for costly operations in Syria and Yemen. The goal was to get European allies to join the United States in increasing pressure on the group, they said.
As a result of the Treasury designations, all their assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked and Americans are prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.
The six individuals were targeted because they are linked to financier Adham Tabaja and his company, Al-Inmaa Engineering and Contracting. The officials described Tabaja as among the top five Hezbollah financiers at the moment.

By granting them asylum, German authorities make it impossible for them to be extradited to face charges, a refusal likely to dismay Turkish authorities, who accuse them of treachery and membership in a terrorist organization.
Turkey accuses Ilham P., a former Turkish colonel whose surname cannot be published in full because of German privacy practices, then head of the Ankara military academy, of being ring-leader of the group.
Germany's Interior Ministry said it could not comment on individual cases for data and personal protection reasons.
Relations between European countries and Turkey have become increasingly strained following President Tayyip Erdogan's large-scale crackdown on suspected supporters of the coup. Some European politicians and human rights groups say the crackdown shows Turkey is sliding into authoritarian rule.
Turkish authorities have jailed more than 50,000 people and sacked or suspended more than 150,000 since the coup, which Ankara blames on supporters of a Muslim cleric living in self-imposed exile in the United States.
The government says such measures are necessary given the multiple security threats it faces. The cleric, Fethullah Gulen, denies involvement in the coup, in which 250 people were killed.
Dozens of German nationals have been detained in Turkey over the past two years, some of them for alleged links to the coup plotters.
Earlier on Friday, a Greek court ruled that a man accused of being behind a series of suicide bombings in Turkey could not be extradited because his life would be in danger back at home.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia's government adopted a lese majeste law on Friday that would make it a crime to insult the king and which rights groups said they feared could be used to target opponents.
Prime Minister Hun Sen's cabinet said an article had been added into the constitution to make an insult to the monarchy a crime punishable by between one and five years in a prison and a fine of between $500 and $2,500.
In a statement after a cabinet meeting, it said the measure was ""to uphold and defend His Majesty the King and His Honor"".
No date has been set for the National Assembly to adopt the final law, but the dominance of Hun Sen's supporters in parliament means its passage is almost guaranteed.
Although King Norodom Sihamoni is Cambodia's head of state, authoritarian leader Hun Sen has dominated the Southeast Asian country for more than 33 years.
Rights groups said they feared the new law could also be used to target critics of the government, which last year had the main opposition party shut down and its leader, Kem Sokha, arrested on treason charges he says were politically driven.
""The cabinet's approval of a lese-majeste law appears to be a further attempt by the government to weaponize the country's legislation against its perceived opponents,"" said Kingsley Abbott, ICJ's Senior International Legal Adviser. 
""The Government's ongoing misuse of the law is particularly concerning given the lack of independent and impartial judges to provide appropriate checks and balances on its power,"" he added.
Neigboring Thailand has the world's toughest lese majeste law, with sentences of up to 15 years for each offense of royal insult.
Prosecutions under the Thai law have risen since a 2014 coup and critics of the junta say it has been used as a means to silence any dissent.

Senior U.S. officials said on Thursday that the Syrian government may be developing new types of chemical weapons, and U.S. President Donald Trump is prepared to consider further military action if necessary to deter chemical attacks. 
Rescue workers and medical groups working in the rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta, near to Damascus, have accused government forces of using chlorine gas three times over the last month, including on Thursday morning.
French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Von der Muhll said that reports from the OPCW, the global chemical weapons watchdog, indicated that Damascus had not met commitments made in 2013 to fully abandon its chemical stockpiles and was not conforming with international conventions banning their use.
""This gives rise to our deepest concern. France does not accept that the convention prohibiting chemical weapons be challenged,"" von der Muhll told reporters in a daily online briefing.
President Bashar al-Assad's government denies using chemical weapons, which it agreed to destroy in 2013 under an agreement brokered by Russia and the United States.
""We are actively working with our partners on this issue and on all reports of new chemical attacks in Syria,"" von der Muhll said.
A deadly sarin attack on a rebel-held area in April 2017 prompted Trump to order a missile strike on the Shayrat air base, from which the Syrian operation is said to have been launched.

French President Emmanuel Macron has said that Paris could launch unilateral air strikes against targets in Syria if a new chemical attack took place, although he has since said he would coordinate any action with Trump.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Conflict between Myanmar's army and guerrillas of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in northern Myanmar has escalated since Jan. 19, including in Sumprabum, Waingmaw and Tanai townships, a U.N. humanitarian report said on Friday.
""The United Nations and its humanitarian partners are concerned about the safety of civilians in these areas,"" it said. 
""The Tanai area has seen heavy fighting since 25 January 2018. There have been reports of a number of civilians killed or injured.""
The KIA is one of Myanmar's most powerful militias and has clashed regularly with the Myanmar military since 2011, when a 17-year-old ceasefire broke down. 
It is part of the predominantly ethnic Chinese Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) which clashed with Myanmar's military in 2015, in fighting that spilled over the Chinese border and displaced tens of thousands. 
The U.N. report said aid agencies were reporting about 1,800 people, mainly laborers, had been evacuated from the Tanai area as a result of the latest fighting, but other civilians were still in the areas of conflict and unable to leave.
U.N. staff had not been granted access to the area and could not independently verify the information, it said. 
In Sumprabum township more than 700 people were sheltering in the forest after being displaced on Jan. 22. They included villagers and about 500 people from an internal displacement camp who fled after mortar bombs landed near the camp.
Tanai and Sumprabum are located on the two major roads running north from Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin state, the northernmost part of Myanmar, between China and India. 
On three occasions since mid-December, most recently on Jan. 27, mortar bombs also landed close to a displacement camp in Waingmaw township, just cross the Irrawaddy river from Myitkyina, the report said. 
Myanmar is already under international scrutiny for its handling of the Rohingya crisis on the Bangladesh border. 
The U.N. human rights investigator for Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, was barred in December from visiting the Rohingya areas and also Kachin and Shan states.
She told Reuters at the time that the civilian government had no authority in Kachin state, since anything connected to security issues was controlled by military commanders.
She called on the international community to put more pressure on military commanders, and on China, to ensure that human rights were respected in the conflict.

204,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 10:43AM ET</span>",South Africa's Zuma faces new no-confidence vote this month,"By Alexander Winning
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's Jacob Zuma faces a no-confidence vote this month, a new attempt to unseat the president by opponents emboldened by splits within his own party.
Zuma, who is battling corruption allegations, is in a weakened position since he was replaced as leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party in December by Cyril Ramaphosa, the deputy president.
The 75-year-old president is expected to meet the ANC's six most powerful officials this weekend, but the agenda of the meeting has not been disclosed. Ramaphosa, 65, has been lobbying the ANC's national executive to force Zuma to resign.
The ANC has said it has discussed Zuma resigning before the end of his term in mid-2019, although his staunch supporters within the party say that will not happen.
Zuma, who has not said whether he will step down voluntarily before his second term as president ends, has been deserted by several prominent allies in the ANC since Ramaphosa took over leadership of what is the only party to govern South Africa since the end of apartheid.
On Friday, parliament speaker Baleka Mbete agreed to a request from the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) for a motion of no-confidence, though she refused to hold the vote before the president's state of the nation address on Feb. 8, and scheduled it for Feb. 22.
The rand, which tends to strengthen on signs Zuma could leave office, pared losses on the announcement from parliament. 
Investors associate Zuma's tenure with a period of economic decline, with growth slowing to an average of 1.5 percent a year and unemployment up to 28 percent from around 23 percent when he took office in 2009.
Zuma narrowly survived a no-confidence vote in August, when some ANC lawmakers voted with the opposition.
""STATE CAPTURE"" INQUIRY
He has survived several no-confidence votes during his rule thanks to loyal voting by ANC lawmakers, who form a strong parliamentary majority. Although Zuma retains the support of a faction within the ANC, he no longer holds a top post.
In its letter requesting the vote, the EFF said Zuma was not a suitable head of state as he is likely to be embroiled in a judicial inquiry into state corruption. Zuma has denied any wrongdoing.
""The majority of parliament is going to say that Jacob Zuma will not be the president of South Africa because the biggest sentiment, even in the ANC, is saying that Jacob Zuma cannot continue as president,"" EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu told eNCA television.
Zuma agreed to establish the inquiry into ""state capture"", a South African term for government corruption, last month. 
Another opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), had lobbied speaker Mbete to postpone the state of the nation address until Zuma had been removed from office.
On Thursday, Mbete said she was aware of ""processes going on, every day and every night"" over Zuma's future but he was due to read the state of the nation speech next Thursday as he was still head of state.
Lukhona Mnguni, political analyst at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said Zuma could take his chances and wait for the no-confidence motion rather than decide to resign.

""Zuma might want to take his chances with the motion and see how many ANC members will come to vote with the opposition and those that would still vote to support him,"" Mnguni said.

205,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 10:36AM ET</span>","U.S. raises pressure on South Sudan's Kiir, bans export of arms, defense services","By Lesley Wroughton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday banned the export of weapons and defense services to South Sudan, stepping up pressure against President Salva Kiir to end the country's four-year civil war. 
""The Department of State today announces that it is implementing restrictions on the export of defense articles and defense services into South Sudan,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
While the United States does not conduct arms sales with South Sudan, the move prevents any U.S. company or citizen from providing military equipment or defense services to the country's warring factions.
The unilateral arms embargo is another signal that Washington is losing patience with South Sudan's leaders after ceasefires have been repeatedly violated. The war has been marked by brutal attacks against civilians, which has sparked the region's biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. 
In South Sudan's capital Juba, Kiir's spokesperson Ateny Wek Ateny declined to comment.
The Trump administration urged neighboring countries and African groups, such as the eight-member Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), to sanction South Sudanese officials who are aiding the conflict. 
""We encourage IGAD and the African Union to consider sanctions measures against those who undermine the peace process,"" Nauert said in the statement.
She said the State Department would amend the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, to reflect the arms ban on South Sudan. ITAR is the official name for a 40-year-old set of rules governing the export of defense goods and data perceived to have implications for U.S. national security.
Countries currently on the ITAR blacklist include Belarus, China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Venezuela.
OFFICIALS SANCTIONED
Some top officials close to Kiir have already been sanctioned by the United States, including the once-powerful army chief Paul Malong, who was later fired and forced into exile when he quarreled with the president.
The African Union on Monday said it was open to imposing sanctions on leaders violating ceasefires in South Sudan, joining a chorus of officials who say those prolonging the conflict must be punished.
""We need to act against those who, with impunity, are continuing to massacre their peaceful populations,"" the head of the African Union commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, told reporters at the AU Summit held in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the U.N. Security Council last week it was time to impose a U.N. arms embargo on South Sudan. Haley visited South Sudan in late October and met with Kiir.
The Obama administration attempted in December 2016 to convince the United Nations to back an arms embargo against South Sudan. 
Any U.S. push for the U.N. Security Council to take further action against South Sudan is likely to be resisted by veto power Russia. The council sanctioned several senior South Sudanese officials on both sides of the conflict in 2015.
""The time has come to acknowledge the hard reality that the leaders of South Sudan are not just failing their people, they are betraying them. And so this Council is at a crossroads,"" Haley told the council last Wednesday. ""We cannot stand by idly as innocent civilians are murdered and raped.""
WAR
Oil-rich South Sudan has been wrecked by civil war since 2013, when troops loyal to Kiir clashed with troops loyal to then-Vice President Riek Machar.
The conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives since then, slashed oil production and driven about a third of the population of 12 million from their homes.
The European Union imposed an arms embargo on Sudan in 1994, which was amended to also apply to South Sudan when the country gained independence from Sudan in 2011.
Independent U.N. experts have reported to the U.N. Security Council that South Sudan's government has spent millions of dollars on weapons as the country slid into famine and an economic crisis.
In January 2016, U.N. experts reported that sources had told them: ""Uganda either supplies South Sudan with its own stock or acquires the weapons and then transfers them to South Sudan, without necessarily involving or obtaining the consent of the primary seller.""

Last year, the U.N. experts said: ""Weapons continue to flow into South Sudan from diverse sources, often with the coordination of neighboring countries.""

The Gelsenkirchen administrative court found that the town of Oer-Erkenschwick had not assessed the local Muslim community's request properly in 2013, but a court spokesman said on Friday that this did not prevent the mosque making a new application.
The local Christian couple had argued that the call to prayers violated their own religious rights.
Anti-Muslim sentiment and support for anti-immigration policies are growing in many parts of Germany after the influx of well over a million migrants from Iraq, Syria and other mostly Muslim countries, beginning in 2015.
Huseyin Turgut, a senior official with the affected mosque, said the court's decision was disappointing.

NEHM, Yemen/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have pumped billions of dollars into fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen, but the Gulf states' three-year campaign risks being derailed after their local allies turned on each other this week.
It was a serious setback for the Saudi-led coalition whose thousands of air strikes have so far failed to deliver victory over seasoned Houthi fighters aligned with Iran.
Riyadh and its allies see victory in Yemen, where they are backed by U.S. weapons and intelligence, as vital if they are to counter Iran's growing influence in the Middle East, a priority for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
But coalition prospects have been dimmed by an armed uprising this week by fighters in southern Yemen, who have been backed the United Arab Emirates (UAE), against government forces until now on the same side.
This comes at a time when the coalition war effort has already been running into trouble. Late last year, the coalition moved quickly to support former president Ali Abdullah Saleh when he seemed to be about to end his backing for the Houthis, but he was killed by the Houthis.
Since then, there has been no sign of a new strategy to end the war in Yemen and Saudi efforts to confront Iran in other theaters including Syria appear to be losing momentum. 
The Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa appears within the grasp of pro-coalition Yemenis, who retook territory from the Houthis after they suffered their own internal struggles late last year. 
But the coalition still faces formidable obstacles. From the Nehm front line 40 km (25 miles) east of Sanaa, the lights of the city are visible at night. The mountains in between are however full of snipers and landmines.
""The geography takes time (to overcome). It is hard to get supplies in and evacuations take too long,"" said Major General Nasr Dhibany of the Yemeni army on a recent tour of the area.
The uprising by UAE-backed southern Yemeni separatists against forces loyal to the Saudi-based and internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi could further complicate efforts to dislodge the Houthis from Sanaa.
Experts say Saudi Arabia and the UAE will need to think again if strains persist between their local allies.
""Many key powers had thought it could somehow just shelve the political grievances among its allies, focus on the fight against the Houthis and everything would work itself out,"" said Adam Baron of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
""This shows the folly of that thinking. Without a large-scale political solution, Yemen's conflict will always develop new tentacles.""
With U.N.-mediated peace talks stalled for over a year, both the Houthis and the coalition-backed government are still hoping to win by force, even as their local alliances unravel.
OUR NECKS
The southern separatists want to restore the independent state of South Yemen, which united with North Yemen in 1990. 
They have fought alongside President Hadi's forces, but rose up this week and seized control of the southern port of Aden after Hadi refused to sack his prime minister, whom the separatists accuse of mismanagement and corruption.
While the UAE says it continues to support the government and the mission of defeating the Houthis, some southern leaders are based in Abu Dhabi and their troops have been armed and funded by the UAE.
The UAE and Saudi Arabia have presented their cultivation of different factions on the anti-Houthi side as a division of labor aimed at the same goal, but the contradictions of the policy have now become clear.
Prime Minister Ahmed bin Daghr remains holed up in a fortified palace in Aden. Though Saudi and UAE troops protect him, armed southerners are posted near the gates in a reminder of the new realities on the ground.
A government source in the palace accused the UAE of backing the uprising to assert its supremacy in the South, saying the southern secessionists were ""just a foreign tool like the Houthis"".
""Our necks are in the hands of the UAE,"" the source told Reuters by phone, declining to be identified.
UAE officials could not be reached for comment, but Foreign Affairs Minister Anwar Gargash on Twitter described the UAE stance as ""clear and principled in its support for the Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia"", adding: ""No solace for those seeking sedition.""
A coalition statement on Thursday said Saudi Arabia and the UAE remained united in seeking a solution that would ""preserve the Yemeni state"", and spokesman Colonel Turki al-Maliki told Reuters the coalition was monitoring the situation.
""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its Coalition partners have come together to relieve humanitarian suffering in Yemen,"" he added in a written statement.
Some pro-government forces withdrew from southern battlefronts, where they had been facing the Houthis, and returned to Aden to help fight the separatists.
""It's obvious that Hadi and Saudi Arabia are trying to reduce the UAE's influence over the South,"" a senior southern secessionist official told Reuters.
Houthi fighters meanwhile face discord within their own ranks and have lost some territory to government forces. Yemeni officials said the rebels were forcibly conscripting fighters and recruiting child soldiers.""From interrogations with (Houthi) captives we see that their morale has collapsed,"" said General Dhibany.
But it not clear that the coalition can push the Houthis out of Sanaa. The main front line east of the city has moved only 80 km (50 miles) in about two years and the rocky terrain leaves government troops exposed.
In one day last week, at least 10 Yemeni soldiers were killed at the Nehm area, officials said.

GENEVA/TRIPOLI (Reuters) - An estimated 90 migrants are feared to have drowned off the coast of Libya after a smuggler's boat capsized early on Friday, leaving three known survivors and 10 bodies washed up on shore, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said.
Survivors told aid workers that most of the migrants on board were Pakistanis, who make up a growing number of those attempting the hazardous voyage across the Mediterranean to Italy from North Africa, IOM spokeswoman Olivia Headon said.
""They have given an estimate of 90 people who drowned during the capsize, but we still need to verify the exact number of people who lost their lives during the tragedy,"" Headon, speaking from Tunis, told a Geneva news briefing.
""What has been reported to us is that it's mostly Pakistanis who were on board the boat, but we still need to verify the nationalities and how many from what country,"" she said.
Ten bodies have washed up on Libyan shores so far, two of them Libyans and the rest Pakistanis, she said.
""I believe the Libyan coastguard is looking for other survivors off the coast,"" Headon added.
Another IOM spokesman, Leonard Doyle, told Reuters Television that the boat was believed to have left shore on Thursday before capsizing early on Friday morning.
LURE OF ""EL DORADO""
The tragedy demonstrates the continued allure of Europe for desperate migrants fleeing conflicts and poverty, Doyle said, despite tighter surveillance of the main smuggling routes by the Libyan coastguard, backed up by European cash and know-how.
""They (the migrants) are lured there by social media. They get onto a phone, they are promised El Dorado, they think life is going to be great. And before they know it, they are getting into the hands of awful criminal, extorting people - smugglers, traffickers, this dreadful, shocking torture,"" he said.
Earlier on Friday security officials in the western Libyan town of Zuwara said two Libyans and one Pakistani had been rescued from the boat. They also confirmed the recovery of 10 bodies, mostly Pakistani, but gave no further information.
Zuwara, located near Libya's border with Tunisia, was a favored site for migrant boat departures over the past two years but of late has seen only occasional departures. A statement from the Zuwara coastguard said their initial information suggested there were some 90 people on board.
Libya is the main gateway for migrants trying to cross to Europe by sea, though numbers have dropped sharply since July as Libyan factions and authorities - under pressure from Italy and the European Union - have begun to block departures.
More than 600,000 people are believed to have made the journey from Libya to Italy over the past four years.
Prior to Friday's incident, some 6,624 migrants are believed to have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year and a further 246 have died, according to IOM figures.
The Libyan coastguard, which receives EU funding and training, has become more assertive in recent months in intercepting migrants and bringing them back to Libya. 
Activists have criticized the policy, saying migrants often face extreme hardship and abuse in Libya, including forced labor, according to Human Rights Watch and other rights groups. 
Migrants who are caught trying to cross to Italy are put in severely overcrowded detention centers authorized by the interior ministry.

The separatists have taken up arms over the past year in an attempt to create a nation they call Ambazonia. The insurgency represents the gravest challenge yet to the 35-year rule of Cameroon's President Paul Biya.
France, which has significant business interests in its former colony and relies on it to fight against Islamist militants, has been careful not to overly criticize the government's handling of the crisis.
""France condemns the new killings of law enforcement officials that took place on 1 February in Cameroon,"" Foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Von der Muhll told reporters in a daily briefing after three gendarmes were killed in separate clashes on Thursday in towns in the North West Region. 
She said only dialogue would enable a peaceful response to the concerns of all sides and ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
""This is a message we are also passing on to the Cameroonian authorities, in close consultation with our European and international partners,"" the spokeswoman added.
Violence has flared in the past week, with armed separatist factions clashing against Cameroon security forces in several towns and villages in the two English-speaking regions after Nigeria deported the leader of the self-declared state and 46 others.
The United Nations refugee agency condemned the handing over of the 47 people, saying most of them had submitted asylum claims and their forced return was in violation of international refugee law. 
More than 43,000 Cameroonians have fled as refugees to Nigeria to escape the government crackdown on the separatists, say local aid officials. The majority are in Nigeria's Cross River state, which borders southwest Cameroon.

LONDON (Reuters) - A British man found guilty of murder after he drove a van into Muslim worshippers outside a London mosque last June, leaving one dead and injuring many more, was jailed for life on Friday and told he would serve at least 43 years behind bars.
Darren Osborne became obsessed with Muslims after watching a BBC TV drama about a child sex abuse scandal involving British Pakistani men and just weeks later carried out the attack in Finsbury Park, north London.
The 48-year-old killed Makram Ali, 51, and injured 12 others, two seriously. He was found guilty on Thursday of murder and attempted murder after the jury took less than an hour to reach their verdict.
""This was a terrorist attack - over the space of a month or so your mind-set became one of malevolent hatred,"" said judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb, sentencing him at London's Woolwich Crown Court. She said he would pose a risk to the public ""perhaps for the rest of your life"". 
On June 18 last year, Osborne drove up from the Welsh capital Cardiff to central London in a hired van with the intent of attacking a pro-Palestinian march. He told the jury he had wanted to kill socialist opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and London's Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan.
Thwarted by road closures, he sought out other targets, eventually arriving hours later in Finsbury Park where he came across a group of Muslims tending to Ali who had collapsed in the street near his home after attending Ramadan prayers.
Shortly after midnight, he drove at them, killing Ali. He later told the court he had tried to kill as many as possible.
""Our father, like the victims of most terrorism, was entirely innocent which makes his death in this violent way all the more hurtful and we cannot imagine the trauma he felt in the last few minutes,"" said Ruzina Akhtar, one of Bangladeshi-born Ali's six children.
Authorities said it was the fourth deadly terrorism incident in Britain last year, following three Islamist attacks which killed 35 people.
Those attacks had helped fuel the anger of Osborne, an unemployed father-of-four who had 102 criminal convictions and a history of violence, depression, drug and alcohol abuse. He had no fixed home and spent the night before the attack in a tent in his ex-partner's back garden. 

After watching the BBC drama, he had sought out information on the internet, exposing him to extreme right-wing figures and racist material from Britain and the United States, the judge said. ""You allowed your mind to be poisoned by those who claim to be leaders,"" Cheema-Grubb said.

ISTANBUL/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish authorities on Friday ordered the detention of 13 people for supporting the national medical association online, the Hurriyet newspaper reported, after the organization publicly opposed a military campaign in Syria.
A prosecutor this week ordered the detention of 11 senior members of the Turkish Medical Association (TTB), including its chairman, after the organization criticized the incursion into Syria's Afrin, saying ""No to war, peace immediately"". President Tayyip Erdogan accused the body of treason.
Three of the medical association members were later released on probation after appearing at an Ankara court on Friday, Hurriyet reported.
More than 300 people have been detained over social media posts that ""criticized, opposed or misrepresented"" the Afrin campaign, which started nearly two weeks ago, the government has said.
Among the 13 people targeted by the latest detention warrants was the gay rights activist Ali Erol, who had tweeted ""War is a public health problem. #WeStandWithTTB"", his organization said. Another person was detained after tweeting ""War is death, destruction, blood and tears. #NoToWar"", other local media reported.
Authorities also raided the residence of a lawyer who had publicly read the statement from the medical association, a lawmaker from the main opposition said.
""They don't want to let anyone breathe,"" Baris Yarkadas, of the Republican People's Party (CHP), said on Twitter.
'RULE OF LAW'
The crackdown on some of Turkey's top doctors has drawn international criticism from the European union, rights group Amnesty International and the World Medical Association, which has called for their protection and an immediate end to the legal proceedings.
The doctors' detentions were ""worrying developments undermining the rule of law and independence and impartiality of the judiciary in Turkey"", EU Commissioner Johannes Hahn and EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement.
The main business lobby warned that a crackdown on self-expression increased polarization and weakened the fight against terrorism.
""While battling terror, a Turkey that defends its freedoms and protects its variety of views will come out of this fight successfully,"" TUSIAD said. 
Erdogan's critics see the latest arrests as emblematic of the purge that has followed a failed 2016 coup. More than 50,000 people have been arrested and 150,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs, moves the government says are necessary given the multiple security threats Turkey faces.
Rights groups and some of Turkey's Western allies fear Erdogan is using the crackdown to stifle dissent and crush his opponents. Freedom House, a Washington-based watchdog, downgraded Turkey to ""not free"" from ""partly free"" in an annual report last month. 
Turkey launched its Afrin operation, dubbed ""Operation Olive Branch"", nearly two weeks ago to target Kurdish YPG fighters near its southern border. Turkey sees the militia as a terrorist group and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). 

Separately, authorities on Thursday ordered the detention of another 13 people in three provinces for protesting against the offensive, police said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has approved the deployment of Russian warplanes on a disputed island near Japan, accelerating the area's militarization at a time when Moscow's ties with Tokyo are strained over the roll-out of a U.S. missile system.
In a decree published late on Thursday, Medvedev allowed the Russian Defence Ministry to use a civilian airport on the island of Iturup, as it is known by Russia, or Etorofu, as it is called in Japan, for its warplanes.
The island was one of four seized by Soviet forces at the end of World War Two and is located off the north-east coast of Hokkaido, Japan's biggest prefecture. The dispute over the islands, known as the Kuriles in Russia and the Northern Territories in Japan, is so acrimonious that Moscow and Tokyo have not yet signed a peace treaty to mark the end of the war.
Medvedev's decree is the latest step in a Russian military build-up that has seen Moscow deploy some of its newest missile defense systems to the islands and plan to build a naval base there even as it continues talks about the territorial dispute.
The decree was published days before deputy foreign ministers from the two countries are due to hold talks about co-operation on the disputed islands and at a time when Russia is concerned that Japan is allowing Washington to use its territory as a base for a U.S. military build-up in north Asia under the pretext of countering North Korea. 
MORE OPTIONS
It is unclear whether Russia will permanently deploy warplanes to the island, which hosted a Soviet air base during the Cold War, or use its airport as and when needed.
The newspaper Kommersant cited an unnamed military source as saying the move would give the Russian military more options.
""This move should show the aerodrome's readiness for fighter planes that patrol our borders to be temporarily based there,"" the source was quoted as saying.
The same source was quoted as saying that Russia was particularly concerned about a Japanese plan to deploy more Aegis U.S. missile systems in its Akita and Yagamata prefectures.
The Japanese embassy in Moscow said the Russian move ran counter to what Tokyo was trying to achieve.
""We believe this could result in Russia's military power being strengthened on the four islands and that contradicts Japan's position on the islands,"" it said in a statement.
""We need a solution to the territorial problem itself in order to fundamentally address these kind of problems.""

Tokyo would keep holding talks with Russia to try to resolve the wider territorial dispute, the embassy said.

PARIS (Reuters) - The French government will send more police to Calais to crack down on migrant gangs, the interior minister said on Friday, after gang rivalries erupted into a brawl that left five migrants suffering serious gunshot injuries
Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said he was sending more riot police to the northern port, where asylum seekers and economic migrants hoping to reach Britain continue to fall prey to smugglers undaunted by a long-running security operation.
Thursday's explosion of violence was a stark reminder that the dismantling of a sprawling camp in late 2016 had failed to halt the arrival of migrants in Calais. It came weeks after Britain promised millions of pounds in extra border control support.
Eritreans and Afghans fought running battles in broad daylight, some armed with rods and metal poles, television pictures showed. It was not clear who was armed with firearms. 
Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart said her town was confronted by all-out gang warfare.
""There will be people here at their wits' ends faced with this increasingly violent presence among a certain number of migrants, who it is plain to see are organized in gangs,"" Collomb told reporters after spending the night in Calais.
""We know there are gang leaders ... and it is these networks we must dismantle,"" the minister added.
FOOD HANDOUTS
Promising to ease the pressure on Calais, where Britain's southern shores can be seen on a clear day, Collomb said that within two weeks the government would take over control of food distribution from local aid groups and conduct the handouts outside the town. 
That, he said, would remove an incentive for the migrants to gather in Calais. 
Francois Guennoc of the Auberge des Migrants charity told BFM TV that the government still lacked a coherent strategy. ""Every time you arrest 10 people, another 10 fill the void."" 
Collomb indicated the French government was concerned that hundreds of thousands of migrants would head to France after their asylum requests were rejected in other European countries, above all Germany.
He said half a million migrants, many of them people who had initially been allowed into Germany, had had their requests for asylum rejected.
""The situation's untenable,"" he told reporters, noting that France registered a record 100,000 asylum requests in 2017. Tens of thousands more had been turned around at the border, he said. 
More asylum seekers in France came from Albania than any other country, according to official data. Collomb said that while Germany dealt with Albanian cases in several days, France took two to three years.

(Reuters) - Punxsutawney Phil, the weather-forecasting groundhog, emerged from his burrow in Pennsylvania on Friday, saw his shadow and predicted six more weeks of winter, despite his rival Staten Island Chuck in New York predicting an early spring.
Phil's prognostication, which was delivered at about 7:20 am EST, was met with a mix of cheers and groans from thousands of revelers on Friday who gathered in the town of Punxsutawney about 80 miles (120 km) northeast of Pittsburgh.
Even though they have endured record-breaking freezing temperatures and an unusually powerful winter storm known as a ""bomb cyclone,"" North Americans should expect winter to stretch on, according to the furry Pennsylvania critter.
But another celebrated groundhog, Chuck in the New York City borough of Staten Island, did not see his shadow on Friday and instead predicted an early spring. Chuck is known for biting then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg during the ceremony in 2009.
According to legend, if the groundhog emerges from his dwelling and sees his shadow, six more weeks of winter should be expected. But if there is no shadow, spring will make an early arrival.
Groundhogs, portly animals belonging to the squirrel family, have been offering weather predictions in Punxsutawney, which has a population of about 6,000 people, since 1887.
The town's annual Groundhog Day event, made more popular by the 1993 comedy film ""Groundhog Day"" starring Bill Murray, draws people from as far away as Australia and Russia. This year was the 132nd ceremony.

Canada has its own share of weather-forecasting mascots, including Wiarton Willie, an albino groundhog who is also due to make his spring prediction on Friday in southern Ontario.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 08:04AM ET</span>",Threatening letter sent to Greek minister working on Macedonia issue,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece is investigating threats against its foreign minister that authorities believe are linked to his attempts to resolve a long-standing name dispute with the neighboring state of Macedonia.
A letter addressed to Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias and received on Thursday said there were ""three bullets"" for him.
""It was threats to him and his family,"" Civil Protection Minister Nikos Toskas told ANT1 TV on Friday. Toskas said that sending threatening letters to those who have been trying to settle a problem in a honest manner was ""dangerous"". 
Kotzias had received other threatening letters and calls in recent weeks, a government official said. 
Kotzias is leading talks to resolve the dispute over Macedonia's name, which has frustrated its ambitions to join NATO and the European Union since the 1990s, and said on Thursday that he would soon submit proposals. 
Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia, has objected to its neighbor's name since the small Balkan state broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991.
Greece argues that the use of the name, along with contentious articles in Macedonia's constitution, imply territorial claims over Greek land.
Many Greeks feel passionately that there can be no deal including the term ""Macedonia"", which for them is the name of the ancient kingdom ruled by Alexander the Great, and an integral part of their heritage.
Because of Greek objections, the Balkan state was admitted to the United Nations with the provisional name ""The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"" in 1993, and this remains its official title in international organizations.
Hundreds of thousands turned out at a demonstration on Jan. 21 in Thessaloniki, capital of Greece's Macedonia region, to protest against any use of the name by the neighboring state, and a rally is scheduled for central Athens on Sunday.
Kotzias, who was an academic before joining the leftist-led government in 2015, in a tweet accused long-time adversaries, in which he also included some unnamed media, of being ""the moral instigators of these threats against my life"".

In a painstaking rescue mission, the exhausted miners were hoisted up one by one after temporary power pylons were installed. None sustained major injuries.
Although the company had said the more than 1,000 mineworkers stuck underground were never in danger, the incident highlights safety concerns in an industry that is home to the world's deepest mines, with workers at some sites operating at depths of up to 4 km.
""Everyone is fine, there were minor injuries and a bit of dehydration but that's all,"" company spokesman James Wellsted said. 
Some workers were rescued on Thursday after emergency power supply from backup generators, but damage to the winder control systems and generators at one of the Beatrix shafts caused by a power surge forced 955 employees to remain underground.
They were hoisted to surface on Friday after temporary power line pylons were installed by Sibanye-Stillwater and Eskom, the country's power utility.
The effort to get the mineworkers to the surface was slow, as they were coming up one at a time, union officials said.
""We can also confirm that all workers did not sustain any injuries ... they are just exhausted,"" spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said.
""The NUM is extremely worried about health and safety measures in all mining companies in South Africa.""
The parliamentary committee on mineral resources asked the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) to explain why its safety inspectors failed to detect that the Beatrix mine did not have a reliable backup power system.
Officials at the DMR were not available to comment.
By November, the 2017 death toll of 76 in South Africa’s mines had already surpassed the 2016 figure of 73, ending nine straight years of falling fatalities and raising red flags for the industry.
The trend reversal is likely to reignite investor concern over mine safety and could prompt regulators to step up shaft inspections, which often result in costly production stoppages.

Karimova-Tillyaeva's departure from public service follows a series of reshuffles made by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev who has removed from his cabinet a number of officials appointed under his predecessor, who died in 2016.
This week, Mirziyoyev consolidated his power by sacking veteran security boss Rustam Inoyatov, who had been regarded as the second most influential official in the country after the president himself.
Karimova-Tillyaeva first announced her plans to resign last August, roughly a year after the death of her father who had run the ex-Soviet Central Asian nation with an iron fist for 27 years.
She said at the time she wanted to focus on her family and personal goals.
Since her father's death Karimova-Tillyaeva had been his only close relative holding a prominent government post.

Lebanon's Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, the son-in-law of President Michel Aoun, enraged supporters of Shi'ite Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, when he was heard in a leaked video calling Berri ""a thug"". Bassil and Aoun are Maronite Christians.
Demanding an apology, supporters of Berri and his Amal movement staged protests in various parts of the country. 
The standoff threatened to inflame sectarian violence and paralyze the government in the run-up to legislative elections in May, the first since 2009 after parliament extended its own term three times.
But Aoun spoke by telephone with Berri on Thursday, and the standoff eased further on Friday with a meeting between the Shi'ite officials and members of Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) in the mainly Christian district of Hadat, on the southern outskirts of Beirut. 
""Our meeting today is a message countering all that happened in recent days,"" said Alain Aoun, an FPM lawmaker. ""It is also a message to (Speaker Berri) that his dignity and ours are one."" 
CALL FOR UNITY
At a joint news conference, lawmakers from Amal, Hezbollah, and the FPM called for national unity and religious tolerance. 
Amal distanced itself from the protests of the past few days, which saw some supporters set tyres ablaze, block roads and fire guns into the air, leading to the deployment of troops in Hadat on Wednesday to prevent violence. 
""Everybody knows the Amal movement has nothing at all to do with what has happened,"" Ali Bazzi, an Amal lawmaker, said.
""And we have the courage the morality... to apologize publicly for any offense that affected the Lebanese on the ground,"" he added. 
The FPM says Bassil has already expressed regret over his remarks, and that it regards the issue as over. Berri has previously said Bassil should apologize ""to the Lebanese people"" for his remarks. 
Tensions between the Aoun and Berri camps had been escalating since December, when the president signed a decree promoting dozens of army officers without the signature of the Shi'ite finance minister, one of Berri's closest aides.
Berri has accused Aoun of exceeding his powers at the expense of other sects. 
The latest standoff has again exposed the fragility of Lebanon's faction-based politics. 
Lebanon's system of government aims to maintain a balance between the country's many religious sects, who fought a 1975-1990 civil war. Berri and Aoun, both now in their 80s, were civil war enemies.
Iran-backed Hezbollah's links to Berri and Amal run much deeper than its political alliance with the FPM.

The Foreign Ministry statement warns Russian citizens that when abroad they face a serious threat of arrest by other countries at Washington's request, after which they could be extradited to the United States. 
""Despite our calls to improve cooperation between the relevant U.S. and Russian authorities ... U.S. special services have effectively continued ""hunting"" for Russians around the world,"" the travel warning said. 
""Considering these circumstances, we strongly insist that Russian citizens carefully weigh up all the risks when planning trips abroad,"" the Foreign Ministry said. 
It said more than 10 Russians had been detained in foreign countries with U.S. involvement since the start of 2017.
By way of example, it pointed to at least four Russians arrested on U.S. cyber crime charges in Spain, Latvia and Greece. U.S. action against suspected Russian cyber criminals surged to a record high last year. 
Seven Russians were arrested or indicted in 2017 in the United States and abroad, compared to an average of two a year in the preceding six years.
The ministry pointed to the case of Stanislav Lisov, accused of creating a computer virus that targeted customers of financial institutions, causing millions of dollars of damage, who was extradited from Spain to the United States last year.
It mentioned earlier cases as well, including the detention of Roman Seleznev for cyber crime in the Maldives in 2014, which it described as a kidnapping by American agents. 
The statement, published on Thursday, also warns Russian citizens that upon extradition they will face biased treatment at the hands of the U.S. justice system.

The ministry said it would submit an analysis of the two options by June 29 for government approval.
Slovakia, a member of NATO, has a maintenance contract with Russia for its 12 MiG-29s until autumn 2019. That contract may need to be extended even if the government agrees to buy new jets by the end of this year, since the new jets typically take 18 to 24 months to deliver.
""Both options are good. F-16s are more expensive and they may take until around 2023 to be delivered,"" Jaroslav Nad from the Slovak Security Police Institute said. 
Neighboring Hungary and the Czech Republic already operate Gripens, built by Saab. Poland flies F-16s, built by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), and may buy more.
Slovakia has a ""joint sky"" agreement with the Czech Republic, which leases 14 Gripens. The agreement means the two would help protect each other's air space beyond the standard air defense cooperation within NATO. If Slovakia buys Gripens, they could also share maintenance and pilot training.
Slovakia is due to spend about 6.5 billion euros ($8.11 billion) by 2030 to modernize its military. Defense spending is due to rise from 1.1 percent of gross domestic product last year to 1.6 percent in 2020 and 2.0 percent by 2024.
In November 2017, the government approved plans to build 81 eight-wheeled armored personal carriers with the Finnish defense company Patria, to replace outdated personnel carriers.
The ministry is set to pick a partner to build 404 four-wheeled armored vehicles this year.

Scarred by memories of the collapse of democracy in the 1930s amid the rise of Adolf Hitler's Nazis, Germany has some of the strictest laws on political extremism in the world, with rules allowing the banning of anti-democratic parties.
Members of the upper house, which represents Germany's 16 federal states, voted unanimously in favor of an application to the constitutional court to stop the financing.
""Ours is a democracy based on debate, but it must also be defended,"" Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, premier of the state of Saarland, told the chamber.
Friday's vote came four months after a national election in which the Alternative for Germany (AfD) became the first far-right party to enter parliament in decades.
Parties that win election to public office in Germany become eligible for generous public financing, designed to fund party organizations and think tanks to raise the quality of policy and public debate.
The NPD's lone member of the European Parliament made the party eligible for around a million euros of public funding in 2016. The party, which sees immigration as a danger to the ""survival of the German people in its Central European Lebensraum"", is no longer in any regional parliament.
Germany's security services have repeatedly attempted to ban the party as unconstitutional but have always been thwarted by courts, who on one occasion found that the party was so riddled with undercover agents that it was impossible to tell what was a genuine party decision and what was not.

Salah Abdeslam, 28, a French citizen born and raised in the Belgian capital, is accused of ""attempted murder in a terrorist context"" over the Brussels shootout in March 2016, four months after he fled Paris on the night of the carnage during which his brother was among the suicide bombers.
Facing a later trial in France over the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks, he will be ferried daily from France under heavy security to the main courthouse in Brussels.
Prosecutors also believe he was associated with three men who blew themselves up at Brussels airport and on the city's metro on March 22, 2016, four days after Abdeslam was arrested close to his family home. However, he and accomplice are only charged with wounding Belgian and French police who raided a suspected hideout in the city on March 15.
""For these acts, he may receive a sentence of up to 40 years in prison,"" Luc Hennart, president of the French-speaking Brussels court of first instance, told Reuters television.
Abdeslam became Belgium's most wanted man after surveillance footage caught him returning from France the day after an Islamist militant group that included his brother killed 130 people in coordinated gun and suicide bomb attacks in Paris.
Despite a massive police effort to find him, he evaded capture for four months before eventually being detained in a raid in the western Brussels district of Molenbeek, home to a large Muslim population mostly of Moroccan origin.
Three days before his arrest, prosecutors say he was one of three men holed up in an apartment in the southern Brussels borough of Forest when police arrived for what they believed would be a routine search linked to the Paris attacks.
Four police officers, including a French policewoman, were wounded and a suspect armed with an assault rifle was killed. Prosecutors say Abdeslam and an accomplice escaped.
The trial is set to trigger high security in a city that was hit by suicide bombings at its airport and on its metro system by members of the same Islamic State-inspired group on March 22, 2016.
More than 100 police are expected to be deployed in and around Brussels' 19th century Palace of Justice, which dominates the skyline over the Renaissance city center.
""These are undeniably tough security measures, but they are simply the consequence of the police's assessment of the security need for the trial,"" Hennart said.

Abdeslam's trial has been repeatedly postponed. Some Belgian media said there may be further delays after proceedings begin on Monday as lawyers ask for more time to prepare their cases.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 05:43AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China-Vatican deal on bishops ready for signing - source,"By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A framework accord between the Vatican and China on the appointment of bishops is ready and could be signed in a few months in what would be an historic breakthrough in relations, a senior Vatican source said.
An even partial resolution of the thorny issue of who gets to appoint bishops could open the way for a resumption of diplomatic relations nearly 70 years after they were cut during the Communist takeover of China.
Full relations would give the Church a legal framework to look after all of China's estimated 12 million Catholics and move on to focus on Catholic growth in a country where Protestant churches are already growing fast.
Catholics in China are split between those in ""underground"" communities that recognize the pope and those belonging to a state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association where bishops are appointed by the government in collaboration with local Church communities.
Under the formal deal, the Vatican will have a say in negotiations for the appointment of future bishops, the source told Reuters, declining to give details.
""It is not a great agreement but we don't know what the situation will be like in 10 or 20 years. It could even be worse,"" the source said on Thursday.
""Afterwards we will still be like a bird in a cage but the cage will be bigger,"" he said. ""It is not easy. Suffering will continue. We will have to fight for every centimeter to increase the size of the cage,"" he added.
The source rejected recent accusations by a senior cardinal that the Vatican was prepared to ""sell out"" the Church in China and media suggestions that Pope Francis was out of the loop on China negotiations.
He said the pope followed the China dossier very closely and had backed an offer made to two Chinese bishops loyal to the Vatican in which they would take on different positions in their dioceses in order to facilitate an overall accord with government-backed bishops.
Five out of seven very complex situations regarding ""illegitimate bishops"", those with government backing, had been resolved. They have asked for a pardon from Pope Francis and to be made legitimate in the eyes of the Church.
CHINA SAYS WILLING TO FURTHER IMPROVE TIES
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement provided to Reuters on Friday that China had always been sincere in its efforts to improve China-Vatican relations.
""We are willing to, in accordance with relevant principles, continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the Vatican side and push forward the improvement of bilateral ties.""
Last December, with papal backing, a Vatican delegation went to China to make an offer relating to two Vatican-recognized bishops.
One, an 87-year-old prelate, would retire to make way for a state-backed bishop to succeed him. Under the scenario, the government would officially recognize the Vatican-backed prelate as ""bishop emeritus"".
Another Vatican-recognized bishop would become an auxiliary, or assistant, to one who had been appointed by the government. Though he would effectively take on a lesser role, the government would grant him official recognition as part of the deal.
The source said both Vatican-backed prelates recognized they would be making sacrifices for the greater good of the Church.
There currently was what the source called ""a gentleman's agreement"" on seven government-backed bishops who would be made legitimate after seeking a papal pardon but this still had to be formalized.
Dossiers have to be prepared for the pope in order to make the case for legitimizing them.
This week, Cardinal Joseph Zen, 86, the outspoken former bishop of Hong Kong, caused a stir with a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post highly critical of the Vatican's recent overtures to China.
Zen wrote: ""So, do I think that the Vatican is selling out the Catholic Church in China? Yes, definitely, if they go in the direction which is obvious from all they are doing in recent years and months"".
In a sharply worded statement following the post, the Vatican said it was surprising and regrettable that some people in the Church were ""fostering confusion and controversy"".
Zen, who has often criticized the Vatican's attempt at rapprochement with Beijing, suggested that Vatican diplomats doing the groundwork were keeping the pontiff in the dark or even going against his wishes.

The Vatican statement said there was no ""difference of thought and action"" between the pope and his aides and the source said the pope had been fully briefed before the delegation left for Beijing in December and after it returned.

230,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 05:23AM ET</span>",UK PM May says Brexit transition deal will be agreed in seven weeks,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday that a Brexit transition period will be agreed with the European Union in seven weeks as she tries to ease concerns that a deal may take longer to reach.
The EU has offered Britain a status quo transition until the end of 2020 after Brexit. Both sides are aiming to reach a transition agreement by the end of March that will form part of the final withdrawal treaty to be agreed later this year.
But there is disagreement inside May's Conservative Party over some details such as the status of EU citizens during the transition and the scope of European Court of Justice jurisdiction.
Many businesses and banks are concerned a battle over the terms of a transition could delay or even sink an agreement just months before Britain exits the EU on March 29, 2019.
""In seven weeks time, we will have an agreement with the European Union, that is the timetable they have said on an implementation period,"" May told the BBC in an interview in China. 
""What the British people voted for is for us to take back control of our money, our borders and our laws and that's exactly what we are going to do,"" May said of Brexit.
The EU and Britain hope to hammer out a deal on Britain's exit and the outline of a trade package by October 2018.
But some EU officials have begun to voice concern that a plan to have the leaders endorse negotiating guidelines for a new phase of talks to begin in April on a future trade agreement may be in danger of slipping if May does not spell out what Britain's demands are for that trade pact.
Once May does so, the EU will need some weeks to prepare its own negotiating proposals. Once adopted by leaders in March, negotiations could then begin with a few weeks.
However, if the March deadline is missed, there would be a risk of waiting until the next full EU summit, which is not planned until late June, creating a very tight deadline to agree a broad political declaration of future trade plans.

""We still expect to be able to have the trade guidelines for the March summit,"" one senior EU official said. ""But Theresa May is being so discreet. If she doesn't say what she wants, we may not be able to prepare our position in time.""

Black clumps have reached the shores of the island of Amami-Oshima, a coast guard official told Reuters by phone. Authorities are checking to see if it is from the Sanchi (IMO:9356608) tanker that sank in the East China Sea last month, after being alerted to its presence by the public.
The government had set up a special unit within Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office to coordinate Japan's response to the latest development, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters.
""The government, while working closely with local authorities, is looking into how broad the range (of oil clumps washed ashore) is and what has caused it,"" Suga said.""We are doing all we can, including dispatching a Coast Guard unit"" to remove the oil, he said. 
Amami-Oshima is part of a chain of islands that includes Okinawa, an area famous for pristine beaches and reef systems. The Iranian tanker sank nearly three weeks ago, raising worries about damage to the marine ecosystem.
The bodies of two sailors were recovered from the ship while a third body was pulled from the sea near the vessel. The remaining 29 crew of the ship are presumed dead.
Earlier the Chinese government said the sunken tanker had created two oil slicks. The ship, which was carrying 136,000 tonnes or almost 1 million barrels of condensate - an ultra-light, highly flammable crude oil - sank after several explosions weakened the hull.
Japan's environment ministry had said last month it saw little chance that the spill would reach Japanese shores.

Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population but Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra, is the only province that enforces Islamic law and outlaws homosexuality.
Religious police and vigilantes in the ultra-conservative province often raid homes and places of work and detain people on suspicion of engaging in homosexual activity.
Police in North Aceh raided hair salons - where transgender people often work - last weekend and briefly detained 12 individuals. Rights activists and media reports said they were forced to cut their hair and were stripped and beaten. 
""There were photos circulated that led us to suspect that there had been physical action taken against the suspects,"" Misbahul Munauwar, a spokesman for Aceh police, said. ""The national police chief has instructed us to investigate those photos and to determine if there was any...procedural or ethical violation.""
A national police spokesman confirmed that police chief Tito Karnavian had ordered the investigation. 
Human Rights Watch and other rights groups welcomed the move, which comes amid a rising tide of hostility against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.
Police in Aceh and elsewhere have stepped up raids on what they call ""gay spas"" and ""gay sex parties"" in recent months, detaining people on charges of violating strict anti-pornography laws.
Dozens of protesters on Friday staged an anti-LGBT rally outside a mosque in the provincial capital Banda Aceh. 
""We don't hate gay, bisexual or transgender people. What we hate is their actions, and if we can prove their actions, they will be punished,"" Aceh governor Irwandi Yusuf told the small crowd.
Last year, the provincial and central governments drew international condemnation after authorities in Aceh tried two young men on charges of engaging in gay sex and then publicly caned them - the first such case in the country.
Indonesia's parliament is also drafting revisions to the national criminal code that could ban all consensual sex outside marriage.
The parliamentary commission drawing up recommendations has still to finalize its proposals, but a draft seen by Reuters includes measures to criminalize extramarital sex, same-sex relations and co-habitation, all of which were previously unregulated. [nL4N1PO3OW]

234,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. to impose arms embargo on South Sudan to end conflict - sources,"By Lesley Wroughton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is set to announce an arms embargo against South Sudan on Friday, three sources familiar with the decision told Reuters, stepping up pressure against President Salva Kiir to end the country's civil war and humanitarian crisis.
The State Department is set to make the announcement later on Friday morning, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The unilateral move would signal that the Trump administration has lost patience with South Sudan's warring sides after ceasefires have been repeatedly violated.
In December 2016, the Obama administration had attempted to convince the United Nations to back an arms embargo against South Sudan. 
Some top officials close to Kiir have already been sanctioned by the United States, including the once-powerful army chief Paul Malong, who was later fired and forced into exile when he quarreled with the president.
While there is no U.S. weapons trade to South Sudan, arms continue to flow into the country through neighboring states from countries in eastern Europe, according to one U.S. source.
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the U.N. Security Council last Wednesday it was time to impose a U.N. arms embargo on South Sudan. Haley visited South Sudan in late October and met with Kiir.
""I urge my fellow Council members to support an arms embargo. This isn’t punishment. Nor is it a meaningless gesture. It is something we can do to actually help the people of South Sudan – to slow the violence, slow the flow of arms and ammunition, and protect innocent lives,"" she told the council last Wednesday.
Any U.S. push for the U.N. Security Council to take further action against South Sudan is likely to be resisted by veto power Russia. The council sanctioned several senior South Sudanese officials on both sides of the conflict in 2015.
""The time has come to acknowledge the hard reality that the leaders of South Sudan are not just failing their people, they are betraying them. And so this Council is at a crossroads,"" Haley told the council. ""We cannot stand by idly as innocent civilians are murdered and raped.""
In an unusual step, the African Union on Monday said it was open to imposing sanctions on leaders violating ceasefires in South Sudan, joining a growing chorus of officials who say those prolonging the conflict must be punished. [nL4N1PO4Y3]
""We need to act against those who, with impunity, are continuing to massacre their peaceful populations,” the head of the African Union commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, told reporters at the AU Summit held in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.
Oil-rich South Sudan has been wrecked by civil war since 2013, when troops loyal to Kiir clashed with troops loyal to then-Vice President Riek Machar.
Since then, the conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives, slashed oil production and driven about a third of the population of 12 million from their homes.
The European Union imposed an arms embargo on Sudan in 1994, which was amended to also apply to South Sudan when the country gained independence from Sudan in 2011.
Independent U.N. experts have reported to the U.N. Security Council that South Sudan's government has spent millions of dollars on weapons as the country slid into famine and an economic crisis.
In January 2016 the U.N. experts reported that sources had told them that ""Uganda either supplies South Sudan with its own stock or acquires the weapons and then transfers them to South Sudan, without necessarily involving or obtaining the consent of the primary seller.""

Last year, the U.N. experts said: ""Weapons continue to flow into South Sudan from diverse sources, often with the coordination of neighboring countries.""

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition faces a weak adversary in an upcoming presidential election in the form of unpopular President Nicolas Maduro but it must overcome a more formidable challenge - abstention in its own ranks.
Maduro's approval ratings are languishing at around 20 percent amid a collapsing economy, runaway inflation and rising malnutrition: a shocking deterioration in a country that was once a byword in South America for oil-financed opulence.
Yet voter motivation is being weakened by concerns about fraud, mistrust of the electoral authority and weak opposition candidates, which may help Maduro clinch a second six-year term.
The government has not yet set a date for the election but has said it must be held before the end of April. 
Opposition leaders are calling for unity in the run-up to the vote but are conditioning their participation on demands such as the creation of a new electoral authority - something Maduro allies appear unlikely to grant.
The most coherent message so far has come from fringe politicians who are insisting the opposition should walk away.
""There is only one answer: No,"" said Maria Corina Machado, who has a significant media profile but little political influence. ""(The opposition) cannot be complicit in a process that seeks to legitimize this regime.""
Optimists believe that the official launch of the campaign for the election could create momentum and convince crisis-weary Venezuelans to vote for whichever candidate faces off against Maduro.
But skeptics insist that the electoral council is in the pocket of the Socialist Party and is likely to alter the results of the vote.
""I wouldn't want to go out and vote for the opposition only to have the results show my vote went to the government,"" said Manuel Melo, 21, a graphic designer who lost a kidney in 2017 when he was hit by a water cannon during a protest.
""Since there's going to be fraud, I'd rather not vote.""
Many have also accused opposition leaders of offering too many concessions to the government and in some cases of working as stalking horse candidates on behalf of Maduro. 
The pro-Maduro Supreme Court last week blocked the opposition's Democratic Unity coalition from running a presidential candidate, requiring aspirants to run under individual parties.
Critics called it an effort to increase division within the opposition and weaken turnout.
LEADERS JAILED OR BARRED
October's gubernatorial elections were a warning sign of how the Socialist Party can score electoral victories despite fury over economic mismanagement. 
Even though polls showed the opposition winning most of the 23 governorships, Maduro allies took 18 of them as a result of heavy abstention.
Many insisted that participating in the vote was legitimizing Maduro's government following what they said was a power grab with the creation of an all-powerful legislature called the Constitutional Assembly in a July ballot boycotted by the opposition.
The governors' vote gave Maduro a political boost and left the opposition divided and squabbling. It boycotted elections for 335 mayors in December, further fueling abstentionism.
With the election at most three months away, the opposition still does not have a standard bearer. 
And the field of candidates has been heavily limited by the government's aggressive moves to jail its best-known leaders or bar them from politics.
Two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles is banned from holding office. Former Mayor Leopoldo Lopez is under house arrest for leading protests against Maduro while his protégé Freddy Guevara is holed up in the residence of the Chilean ambassador, seeking to avoid arrest on similar accusations.
However, former union leader Andres Velasquez has shown interest in a presidential bid, while ex-Lara state Governor Henri Falcon has called on the opposition to unite behind him. Former Congress chief Henry Ramos has also said he would run in opposition primaries.
Both Ramos and Falcon have done better in recent polls than Maduro, according to Luis Vicente Leon, director of pollster Datanalisis, adding that Maduro is widely rejected by the population.
But doubts about the fairness of elections and limited motivation following the opposition's recent ballot box fiascos may make that irrelevant.

""The opposition is indeed the majority, but that won't matter if it make can't mobilize its people in an election,"" Leon said in a telephone interview.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A dozen members of the U.S. Congress have nominated Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and its most prominent student leader for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, prompting a denunciation from Beijing for interfering in China's affairs. 
In nominating Joshua Wong, 21, and his colleagues Nathan Law, 24, and Alex Chow, 27, who led tens of thousands in the former British colony's largest pro-democracy protest in 2014, the lawmakers wanted to recognize ""their peaceful efforts to bring political reform and self-determination to Hong Kong"".
The protests, which the Chinese and Hong Kong governments deemed illegal, were part of a populist uprising that posed one of the greatest challenges for Communist Party rulers in Beijing in decades. 
The reference to self-determination was certain to rile authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong, who say the notion is inconsistent with the principle of ""one country, two systems"" under which the Asian financial hub returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 
""Hong Kong's pro-democracy advocates have made significant contributions to peace by actively seeking to safeguard the future of Hong Kong at precisely the time that Beijing has taken steps to undermine Hong Kong's long-cherished autonomy,"" four Democrats and eight Republicans, including former presidential hopeful Marco Rubio, told the Nobel Peace Prize Committee in a letter.
If Wong wins, he would be the second youngest person to receive a Nobel Prize after Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai, who was 17 when she became a laureate in 2014. The winner will be announced in October. 
Tens of thousands of protesters, some wielding umbrellas to shield themselves from tear gas and pepper spray, set up camp on major highways for 79 days in late 2014, demonstrations that grabbed international headlines. 
But the mostly peaceful protests failed to pressure Hong Kong and Beijing authorities to grant the city full democracy.
Critics decry a series of subsequent ""payback"" incidents, including months-long jail terms for the trio and, most recently, a ban on Wong's ally, Agnes Chow, running in a legislature by-election.
Hong Kong authorities have denied political interference, saying everything was done in accordance with the law.
The ""one country, two systems"" principle promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed in China, such as freedom of speech and an independent judiciary. But many observers see a gradual erosion of those freedoms.
The nominations provoked anger from Beijing's Communist Party rulers who say the city is an inalienable part of China.
In a statement sent to Reuters, China's Foreign Ministry said that Wong and the others involved in the protests had been punished in accordance with the law, labeling the protests they lead as ""illegal from head to toe"".
""We urge the relevant U.S. Congressmen to stop interfering in Hong Kong and China's internal affairs, and do more to benefit the development of Sino-U.S. ties rather than the opposite,"" it added.
Wong, who faces two appeals over separate jail sentences, said he hoped the nomination would give more bargaining power to the city's democratic movement.
""I believe the nomination would show the international community and (Chinese President) Xi Jinping how the young generation will persist in fighting for democracy, even if we have to face imprisonment or a permanent ban from public office,"" Wong said.
China's only Nobel Peace Prize winner, dissident intellectual Liu Xiaobo, died last July, becoming the first Nobel Laureate to die in custody since Carl von Ossietzky died under Nazi Germany's watch in 1938.

His wife, Liu Xia, said to suffer from severe depression, is still under effective house arrest.

French drug maker Sanofi (PA:SASY) revealed in November that Dengvaxia - the world's first dengue vaccine - might increase the risk of severe disease in people who had never been exposed to the virus. The news prompted an uproar in the Philippines, where more than 800,000 school-age children had been vaccinated in 2016.
Sanofi officials were not immediately available for comment on the government announcement.
The Philippine Health Ministry halted Dengvaxia immunizations in November. It formed a 10-member panel of experts to determine if the drug was directly connected to the deaths of 14 children after they were given the vaccine.
It found it may have been connected to the deaths of three.
""Three cases were found to have causal association. They died of dengue even (though) they were given Dengvaxia. Two of them may have died because of vaccine failure,"" Health Undersecretary Enrique Domingo told a news conference.
""These findings strengthen the decision of the Department of Health to stop the vaccine. It has failed in some children. Dengvaxia is not ready for mass vaccinations and we would need three to five more years to watch and monitor if there would be other adverse reactions from the vaccine.""
Mosquito-borne dengue is the world's fastest-growing infectious disease, afflicting up to 100 million people worldwide, causing half a million life-threatening infections and killing about 20,000 people, mostly children, each year. 
Domingo said the panel's findings would be shared with the justice department, which is considering cases against those responsible for the mass immunization program.
Pediatrician and panel member Juliet Sio-Aguilar, from the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital, said the team was recommending further studies as it was difficult to directly connect the three deaths to Dengvaxia.
No vaccine has a 100 percent success rate, she said. The dengue death rate in the Philippines was 60 times higher than global rate, Sio-Aguilar said.
The Philippines spent 3.5 billion pesos ($68 million) on the Dengvaxia program to reduce the 200,000 dengue cases reported every year. 
The Philippines has already fined Sanofi a symbolic $2,000, citing violations in product registration and marketing.

239,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 02:21AM ET</span>",'Bonghjornu' not 'Bonjour': Corsican nationalists want to say it their way,"By Ingrid Melander and Paul Ortoli
AJACCIO, France (Reuters) - A group of ten-year-old schoolchildren on the Mediterranean island of Corsica proudly raised their hands in class one morning this week to say they felt Corsican, not French. 
Their teacher, Nathalie Lanfranchi, grew up speaking French at home but now talks with her daughters in Corsican and teaches in both languages in this school in the outskirts of the island's biggest city, Ajaccio.
In some countries, that would raise few eyebrows.
But for France, a centralized state with a single, national identity and only one official language, Corsica's demand for more autonomy is a challenge.
The children - 11 consider themselves to be only Corsican, one only French and one claims both identities - greeted visitors with a cheerful Corsican ""Bonghjornu"" rather than the French ""Bonjour"". 
But President Emmanuel Macron may face a cooler welcome when he visits the island next week after ministers infuriated Corsica's nationalist leaders by refusing several of their demands, including official status for the Corsican language. 
""Our goodwill has been taken for weakness by Paris but we are not weak, we are strong with the support of Corsicans,"" said regional parliament speaker Jean-Guy Talamoni.
""Corsicans want to be recognised as a nation,"" he said, adding that a protest march on Saturday would show just that. 
Unlike Spain and Germany, France has always been reluctant to give much power to its regions, despite some decentralization in the 1980s. 
With nationalism on the rise, as in Catalonia and other regions of Europe, Corsicans elected nationalist leaders in December and Macron now faces demands for local powers over issues as varied as taxation and property buying. 
NO FRENCH FLAG
While the French tricolor flies over official buildings throughout France, it was not to be seen in Talamoni's office, or on the front of the town hall in Granace, a tiny village of ancient stone houses in southern Corsica.
Instead, mayor Jean-Yves Leandri proudly displayed the black-and-white flag with a Moor's head that symbolizes Corsica. 
Rather than the tricolor sash French elected officials wear for ceremonial duties, Leandri conducts weddings with one he had specially made, again adorned with a Moor's head. He never went to pick up the portrait of Macron that should be hanging on his wall.
""We took away the French flag, it's got nothing to do here, it's Corsica,"" the 54-year-old mayor said.
Leandri, a nationalist since his early 20s, is not the first in his family to be elected mayor of the village of about 100 souls. But he is the first nationalist.
Nationalist groups had staged thousands of attacks over four decades before laying down their weapons in 2014, and it took a long time to convince voters to back nationalist politicians, Leandri said.
""People used to be afraid of us,"" he said. He managed to convince people to vote for him only when the violence stopped.
""Now we need to work, and work more than the others, to build a country,"" he said.
AUTONOMY OR INDEPENDENCE?
In a sign of how widespread demands for autonomy have become in Corsica, Jean-Andre Miniconi, a local business leader, said authorities on the island needed more powers to boost its economy and deal with specific problems such as higher transport costs and a shortage of affordable housing. 
Even the conservative mayor of Ajaccio, Laurent Marcangeli, said he favored giving the Corsican language official status alongside French, and wanted special status for the island in the French constitution.
But where they differ with nationalists, and where even nationalists disagree among themselves, is on whether autonomy would be enough or if they should aim for independence.
In wealthy Catalonia, which has had wide powers and where Catalan is an official language, Corsica's demands for autonomy would seem modest.
But Corsica has only 325,000 inhabitants and accounts for less than 0.5 percent of France's economy. One in five inhabitants lives under the poverty threshold.
Parliament speaker Talamoni, who wants independence at some point in the future and calls France ""a neighbouring country"", says independence currently only has minority support and Corsica must first build up its economy and administrative infrastructure. 
He struck a 10-year deal with nationalist politician Gilles Simeoni, who is also not a separatist, to seek more powers for Corsica but not independence.
This pact, together with the new-found peace and disillusion with mainstream parties, propelled them to victory in December, with Simeoni emerging to lead the regional government. 
While they must convince Macron to delegate powers to their region, Simeoni and Talamoni must also ensure that activists who fought for such powers, often by blowing up buildings and attacking government officials, don't feel left out, said Jean-Paul Carrolaggi, a veteran separatist.

Simeoni said Macron must show next week that he is willing to heed some of their demands, warning that some return to violence on the island could not be excluded if Corsicans felt they were not being heard. [L8N1PR1AB]

RABAT/MARRAKECH, Morocco (Reuters) - Moroccans risking their lives scraping coal from abandoned mines have listened to local officials, the mining ministry and a close royal ally since they began protesting five weeks ago. Now some of them want the king himself to intervene.
""When they closed the mines they offered us new jobs and compensation but nothing has happened,"" said one former miner in the northern town of Jerada who declined to be named, fearing reprisal.
""We will keep protesting until our lives improve.""
The miners have been left behind by the economic liberalization that won plaudits from the International Monetary Fund at a regional conference in Marrakech this week headlined ""Opportunity for all"".
King Mohammed VI, the ultimate power in Morocco, has lifted living standards in urban and coastal areas and raised the country's profile abroad, rolling out investment in Ivory Coast and other sub-Saharan countries.
But public dissatisfaction is growing in some poor areas at a time when the government is implementing currency reforms and cutting subsidies to drive economic growth.
The Jerada protests have found common cause with dissent that has rumbled since 2016 in the Rif, also in the north, both groups spurred by the deaths of men desperate trying to make ends meet.
They are a far cry from the mass protests which rocked the North African country in 2011 when uprisings ousted rulers in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, but pose a challenge to a constitutional monarchy in which the king has far-reaching powers.
Stability in Morocco is important for Western governments as it is the only country in North Africa where jihadist groups have failed to gain a foothold. Rabat is also a key intelligence-sharing partner on Islamist militancy.
At least 10 million people visit its beaches and cities each year, some of them switching from Egypt and Tunisia after those countries suffered political turmoil and militant attacks.
CONTRAST
While Marrakech, an ancient city, is bustling with tourists and new buildings have gone up in the commercial center Casablanca and capital Rabat, the changes have bypassed rural areas like Jerada in the remote northeast.
Protests there swelled in late December after two brothers drowned scavenging coal deep underground: one of them hacked through into an adjoining water well, flooding the shaft.
On Thursday, another miner, in his early 30s, was killed when a shaft collapsed, the interior ministry said. Activists issued a renewed call for protests.
Residents say the town has been neglected since the mines closed some 20 years ago and tensions with Algeria shut the nearby border at around the same time.
The miners say they sell a bag of coal for between 60 and 80 dirham ($6.5-$8.7) to traders who pass it on for 600 dirham to restaurants, hotels and public baths.
""Influential people exploit the miners, who have no other jobs, and officials know about this,"" said Abdelwahab Hoummani, an activist in Jerada. ""We demand jobs, development and the prosecution of corrupt people.""
The mining ministry was not immediately available to comment, but Mining Minister Aziz Rabbah said in January the state had ""reacted positively"" to the town's demands and a commission had been paying out compensation for closed mines.
Protests had rumbled against high electricity bills before the miners' deaths, and Jerada residents say they will continue, even though dozens of leaders and members of the protest movement in Rif, Hirak al Chaabi, are now on trial.
KING
Police have set up checkpoints to monitor people's movements to and from Jerada, where residents say miners gather every week in the main square to demand state aid and alternative jobs.
Some shout ""Hirak, Hirak"", social media posts show, in solidarity with Rif, where protests began after a man was crushed to death in a rubbish truck trying to retrieve fish that had been caught illegally and thrown away by police.
No-one at the demonstrations calls for overthrowing the king, who heads the Muslim world's longest continuing dynasty.
Many Moroccans are wary of the kind of instability rocking Libya and other parts of the region and criticize the government and king's entourage rather than the monarch himself.
The government is investing in tourism, with a new airport for the main northeastern city of Oujda, 60 km (40 miles) from Jerada, to bring tourists to equally new nearby coastal resorts.
It announced auto industry projects worth 1.23 billion euros($1.54 billion) in December and hopes the currency reform will boost investment and help growth reach 3.4 percent this year, after 4 percent last year, when agricultural output was better.
Manufacturing jobs have been created, but not enough for a growing population and many young Moroccans have sought work abroad.
The king has called for more development, fired top officials in October after a state agency found inequality, and sent a close ally, Agricultural Minister Aziz Akhenouch, to Jerada late in January to talk to angry residents.
Akhenouch, one of Morocco's richest men, announced agricultural investments worth around 28 million dirham ($8 million), local media said, but protests resumed the next day.
""The king is probably the only one who can solve this,"" said Hoummani, the activist.
Geoff Porter from North Africa risk consulting said the government would find it hard to stick to its market liberalization without alienating the rural poor.
At the Marrakech conference, Prime Minster Saad Eddine El Othman said the government was rolling out programs to remove inequalities.
Abdelghani Ajjani from a Jerada commission negotiating with authorities, had yet to be convinced. ""The government has made the same promises they made when closing the mines,"" he said. ""There are people here who think the king should visit Jerada.""

In a debate in parliament earlier this week, Baker suggested government officials may be undermining government policy by calibrating their work to show only the downside of Brexit.
Asked if she planned to sack Baker, May said: ""No.""

""The ministerial code says that the minister should take the earliest opportunity to amend the record that was given to Parliament and apologise to Parliament. He will do that,"" she added, speaking to Channel Five news during a trade visit to China.

243,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 12:29AM ET</span>","Are you OK, Aunty May? China warms to UK Prime Minister","By William James and Ben Blanchard
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May landed in China earlier this week fending off questions about her future amid mounting accusations of poor leadership, boring policies, and weakness over Brexit.
By Friday the 61-year old leader was basking in a warm reception from the leaders of world's second-largest economy, while concerned Chinese citizens affectionately nicknamed her 'Aunty May' and worried if her legs were warm enough in the Beijing cold.
""What's past is prologue,"" said President Xi Jinping during his one-to-one meeting with May, quoting British playwright William Shakespeare to signal his hopes for strengthening ties. 
The three-day trade visit has seen May earn assurances from China that Brexit will not affect the country's enthusiasm for the so-called ""golden era"" of relations and a promise to open up Chinese markets to new British business.
While words will mean little if not backed up with action, and there are scant details about the headline announcement of 9 billion pounds of trade deals signed during the trip, the mood music for May's visit pointed to a Chinese state seeking to rally support around her.  
""Her political style is known for being pragmatic and strong and deft at decision making. She's Britain's Iron Lady,"" said the Hubei Daily, an official regional newspaper, referring to the nickname of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
There was no sign of a hangover from the 2016 diplomatic spat between the two nations caused by May's decision to delay a part Chinese-funded nuclear plant over concerns about foreign investment in key British infrastructure. 
""China really respects Britain,"" said the influential Global Times tabloid - the same newspaper which in 2013 dismissed Britain as ""just an old European country apt for travel and study"" in a scathing editorial during a visit by May's predecessor David Cameron, who had infuriated China by meeting the Dalai Lama. 
One Chinese official remarked dryly to Reuters: ""Nobody would call him Uncle Cameron"".
Asked by Chinese state television about her new moniker - a common Chinese term of endearment for respected women - May said she was honored, and her officials were privately thrilled that the name had stuck. 
By contrast, the front page of this week's Spectator, a British political magazine, reads ""Lead or go"", above a stark, unflattering cartoon of May, hunched and bow-legged. 
RIVAL SUITORS
But, Britain is not the only state looking to woo China. 
Last month France's energetic young President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Beijing with an attention-grabbing gift, a rare horse, although his tough words over Xi's signature plan to create a trillion-dollar modern-day Silk Road raised eyebrows.
Diplomatic sources say while China has expressed concern about Brexit, it has also been reassured by messages that Britain's door is wide open to Chinese investment - a marked contrast to the suspicious reception Chinese companies have recently received in Germany.
May brought up awkward issues like democracy in Hong Kong, human rights and ethical concerns about Xi's Belt and Road initiative, but was praised as ""pragmatic"" by the Global Times for not pressing the issue in public.
""For the prime minister, the losses outweigh the gains if she appeases the British media at the cost of the visit's friendly atmosphere,"" the paper wrote in an editorial on Friday.
On Chinese social media, concern about May's visit focused on less weighty issues - like whether her exposed legs were warm enough after a photograph of her with husband Phillip inside Beijing's Forbidden City.
""Theresa, you really know how to stand up to the cold,"" wrote one of over 17,000 users to comment on her official Chinese-language Weibo account.

244,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 12:28AM ET</span>",Fidel Castro's eldest son 'Fidelito' commits suicide,"By Sarah Marsh and Marc Frank
HAVANA (Reuters) - The eldest son of late Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, committed suicide on Thursday aged 68 after being treated for months for depression, Cuban state-run media reported.
The nuclear scientist, also known as ""Fidelito"", or Little Fidel, because of how much he looked like his father, had initially been hospitalized and then continued treatment as an outpatient.
""Castro Diaz-Balart, who had been attended by a group of doctors for several months due to a state of profound depression, committed suicide this morning,"" Cubadebate website said.
Fidelito, who had the highest public profile of all Castro's children, was born in 1949 out of his brief marriage to Mirta Diaz-Balart before he went on to topple a U.S.-backed dictator and build a communist-run state on the doorstep of the United States during the Cold War.
Through his mother, Castro Diaz-Balart was the cousin of some of Castro's most bitter enemies in the Cuban American exile community, U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart and former U.S. congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart.
He was also the subject of a dramatic custody dispute between the two families as a child.
Cuba scholars say his mother took him with her to the United States when he was aged five after announcing she wanted a divorce from Castro, while he was imprisoned for an attack on the Moncada military barracks in Santiago.
Castro was able to bring Fidelito back to Cuba after the 1959 revolution.
A multilingual nuclear physicist who studied in the former Soviet Union, Castro Diaz-Balart was head of Cuba's national nuclear program from 1980 to 1992, and spearheaded the development of a nuclear plant on the Caribbean's largest island until his father fired him.
Cuba halted its plant plans that same year because of a lack of funding after the collapse of Cuba's trade and aid ties with the ex-Soviet bloc and he largely disappeared from public view appearing at the occasional scientific conference or diplomatic event.
Fidelito had been working for his uncle President Raul Castro as a scientific counselor to the Cuban Council of State and Vice-president of the Cuban Academy of Sciences at the time of his death.
A former British ambassador to Cuba, Paul Hare, who lectures at Boston University’s Pardee School of Global Studies, said Castro Diaz-Balart had seemed ""thoughtful, rather curious about the world beyond Cuba"" at a dinner in Boston two years ago.
""But he seemed a bit weary about having to be a Castro, rather than himself,"" Hare said.
Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, a Cuba expert at the University of Nebraska in Omaha, said Fidelito had provided him with invaluable help in the 1990s while he was writing a book on Cuba's nuclear program.
In 2000 they met again at a conference in Moscow and Fidelito worked ""the room full of international nonproliferation experts, diplomats and journalists with aplomb, speaking no less than four languages -Spanish, English, Russian and French.""
Benjamin-Alvarado said he suspected Fidelito's title as scientific advisor was largely ceremonial as his views on energy development were not incorporated into national policies.
""He had written extensively on Cuba’s need for developing renewable energy resources,"" Benjamin-Alvarado said. ""And yet almost all efforts by the Cuban government were geared to maintaining the status quo of oil dependency.""
""I imagine that was disappointing for him.""

Fidelito's death came just over a year after that of his father on Nov. 25, 2016, aged 90.

245,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 10:06PM ET</span>",Tillerson raises prospect of Venezuela military ouster of Maduro,"By Jon Herskovitz
AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson raised the prospect on Thursday that the Venezuelan military could decide to oust President Nicolas Maduro, but said he did not know whether that would happen.
In a speech at the University of Texas ahead of a five-nation Latin American tour, Tillerson insisted the Trump administration was not advocating ""regime change"" in Venezuela, but said it would be ""easiest"" if Maduro chose to leave power on his own. 
Tillerson predicted there would be change of some kind in Venezuela and said the United States, which has had steadily worsening relations with the country's Socialist government, wanted it to be a peaceful one.
Maduro, whose approval ratings are low amid a collapsing economy, runaway inflation and rising malnutrition in the oil-producing country, is seeking re-election in a vote that must be held by the end of April.
“We have not advocated for regime change or removal of President Maduro. We have advocated that they return to the constitution,” Tillerson said when asked during a question-and-answer session whether the removal of Maduro was necessary or the United States would play a role in it.
He then suggested the possibility, however, that internal forces might take action, although he offered no evidence the United States had intelligence backing the notion that the military might turn against Maduro.
""In the history of Venezuela and in fact the history in other Latin American and South American countries, often times, it is the military that handles that,"" Tillerson said.
""When things are so bad that the military leadership realizes that it just can't serve the citizens anymore, they will manage a peaceful transition,"" he said. But he added: ""Whether that will be the case here or not, I do not know.""
CARACAS SEES RIGHT-WING CONSPIRACY
The United States and other Western governments accuse Maduro's government of violating political and human rights in Venezuela and have imposed economic sanctions. Critics at home say Maduro, who succeeded Hugo Chavez in 2013, has wrecked the economy and skewed the election system to perpetuate power for his Socialist Party.
Maduro's government, which is allied with Cuba's Communist leadership, says it is fighting a U.S.-led right-wing conspiracy determined to end socialism in Latin America, hobble Venezuela's economy and steal its oil wealth.
The Venezuelan government did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
""Maduro should get back to his constitution and follow it,"" Tillerson said. ""And then, if he is not re-elected by the people, so be it.""
""Then, if the kitchen gets a little too hot for him, I am sure that he's got some friends over in Cuba that could give him a nice hacienda on the beach and he could have a nice life over there.""
Tillerson also took aim at the Cuban government, which he said ""disregards their people."" U.S.-Cuba tensions have increased with President Donald Trump's reversal last year of elements of predecessor Barack Obama's rapprochement with America's Cold War foe.
Tillerson said that Cuba ""has an opportunity, in their own transfer of power from decades of the Castro regime, to take a new direction.""

It was a reference to plans for Raul Castro to hand over the presidency to a successor later this year, although he is set to retain the influential post of Communist Party chief.

Former Tropical Cyclone Fehi this week has brought heavy rain that flooded the southern city of Dunedin and west coast town of Buller, forcing authorities to declare a state of emergency and ask people not to travel by road.
New Zealand authorities said the adverse weather has damaged a major road around Haast, 426 km (265 miles) northwest of Dunedin, leaving hundreds of tourists stranded in the town.
""There are at least 600 tourists in Haast and we are undertaking a welfare assessment of their needs,"" Westland District Council said in an emailed statement.

MALE (Reuters) - The Supreme Court of the Maldives on Thursday ordered the immediate release of former president Mohamed Nasheed and eight other opposition leaders, saying their trials had violated the constitution and international law - but it also ordered new trials.
The country has been mired in political unrest since Nasheed, its first democratically elected leader, was ousted in 2012. He was later sentenced to 13 years in jail on terrorism charges after a trial denounced as hasty and unfair by the United Nations human rights chief.
In its ruling on Thursday, the Supreme Court said it found that prosecutors and judges had been unduly influenced ""to conduct politically motivated investigations"" into the allegations leveled at Nasheed, former vice president Ahmed Adeeb and the other opposition leaders who had challenged President Abdulla Yameen. 
It ordered fresh investigations and trials to be held.
It also nullified a ruling in which 12 legislators lost their parliamentary seats for defecting last July from Yameen's ruling party. Yameen lost his majority in the 85-member legislature after the defections.
Ibrahim Hussain Shihab, a spokesman for the President's Office, said in a statement that the government had questions about the ruling but would comply with it.
""The Administration will work to engage, and consult with, the Supreme Court in order to comply with the ruling in line with proper procedure and the rule of law.""
Attorney General Mohamed Anil said however that Yameen had dismissed the chief of police following the ruling after he had been unable to reach him to ensure law and order.
After the ruling, hundreds of opposition supporters cheered and waved national flags outside the main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) campaign center.
Islamic prayers were also recited at the opposition rally, and people chanted: ""The government is over.""
Maldives police said their commissioner - prior to his sacking by Yameen - and deputy commissioner had decided to enforce the ruling after seeking legal advice.
""Police have started work to enforce the ruling,"" they said on Twitter.
President Yameen's official website said the defense minister had called on the Maldivian people to put on a united front and work together to maintain peace and stability.
U.S. Ambassador for Maldives Atul Keshap welcomed the Supreme Court decision. ""I urge the government and security services to respect this ruling, which bolsters democracy and rule of law all Maldivians,"" Keshap tweeted. 
Nasheed, who has been in exile in the United Kingdom but wants to contest a presidential poll this year, had sought U.N. help to restore his political rights.
The joint opposition in a statement welcomed the rulings and called for the immediate resignation of President Yameen.

""The Supreme Court's verdict effectively ends President Yameen's authoritarian rule,"" it said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States for the first time in years is sending its diplomat responsible for foreign military sales to the Singapore Airshow to promote U.S.-made weapons, a U.S. official said on Thursday, as the State Department prepares for an overseas arms sales push. 
The attendance of Ambassador Tina Kaidanow at the Feb. 6-10 air show, the most important in the Asia Pacific region, is aimed at boosting sales for U.S. arms manufacturers such as F-35 jets made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and missile manufactured by Raytheon Co. 
President Donald Trump's administration is nearing completion of a new ""Buy American"" initiative that calls for U.S. military attaches and diplomats to play a much bigger role in the sale of billions of dollars more in business overseas. 
(For a graphic on U.S. arms sales click http://tmsnrt.rs/2nwJdar) 
""We will be working at strengthening our advocacy at every level of the embassy, from your commercial officer, up through your ambassador,"" the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity told reporters on Thursday.
Singapore could be seen as the test case for the Trump administration's new strategy of having the Pentagon and the U.S. State Department take a more active role in securing foreign arms deals, which require State Department approval.
For the first time since at least 2009, the U.S. delegation at the air show will include the top State Department official overseeing arms sales. Kaidanow holds that role with the title principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. 
The U.S. exported $49.5 billion of aerospace and defense products to Asia-Pacific in 2016, compared to European demand of $49.8 billion, according to U.S. Department of Commerce data.
The official said of the ""Buy America"" initiative, ""I would expect with all of the energy the U.S. government is putting behind this, as well as all of the energy the companies are putting behind this, that I would hope to see very good numbers"" for foreign military sales.
The State Department said in a statement that Kaidanow ""will hold consultations on defense trade issues and promote more than 150 U.S. companies and trade organizations exhibiting the latest aerospace technologies.""
Demand for U.S.-made arms is high and foreign military sales in fiscal 2017, comprising the final months of Obama's term and much of Trump's first year in office, climbed to $42 billion, compared to $31 billion in the prior year, according to the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency.
Remy Nathan, vice president for international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association aid, ""The Asia-Pacific region was our industry's largest regional export destination for several years before Europe overtook it in 2016.""

249,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 07:02PM ET</span>",Mexico debate swirls over 'opaque' talks with U.S. as Tillerson lands,"By Gabriel Stargardter
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United States' top diplomat landed in Mexico on Thursday with debate swirling over the government's efforts to win favor with Washington and save the NAFTA pact from collapse, sparking concerns it is ceding sovereignty to its northern neighbor. 
Mexico has been at pains to prove itself a good ally to the United States on combating drug trafficking and immigration, in hopes this would help efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement on as favorable terms as possible.
Those secret efforts sprang into view this week, when Reuters exclusively reported that Mexico is considering allowing U.S. air marshals aboard commercial cross-border flights, igniting a debate over what lengths Mexico should go to in order to win favor with its top trade partner. 
""The question is, what else is (Foreign Minister Luis) Videgaray giving to Trump and his collaborators in exchange for preserving NAFTA?"" Salvador Garcia Soto asked in his El Universal newspaper column, decrying Videgaray's ""opaque"" maneuvering. 
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson landed in Mexico City on Thursday afternoon and was due to have dinner with Videgaray and other senior Mexican government and national security officials at U.S. Ambassador Roberta Jacobson's residence. 
Although Tillerson has not been a prominent player in the NAFTA discussions, the future of the treaty is certain to loom over his visit, especially at a trilateral meeting with Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland on Friday.
Mexico's government, and particularly the foreign ministry, has pushed hard to defend NAFTA, a lynchpin of its export-led economy, ahead of a July 2018 election in which the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party is currently polling third.
""All our efforts right now are based around NAFTA and making sure the pact doesn't collapse,"" said a senior Mexican diplomat.
Videgaray has said closer cooperation with the United States is the best way to achieve Mexico's foreign policy aims.
""Obviously that would be something that we strongly want to avoid,"" Videgaray said at an event in New York late last year, referring to NAFTA collapsing. ""We realize that we could achieve much more by being constructive and by approaching the relationship looking for common ground ... with very active cooperation.""
Quizzed by ruling party lawmakers on Tuesday, Videgaray denied the air marshals were part of any NAFTA quid pro quo, but said the government was studying the plan.
CLOSER TIES
Tillerson's Mexico City visit is the first leg in a week-long Latin America trip in which he hopes to keep up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over his restrictions on domestic political opposition.
Earlier on Thursday, in a speech at his alma mater University of Texas at Austin, Tillerson raised the prospect that the Venezuelan military could decide to oust President Nicolas Maduro but said he did not know whether that would happen.
Tillerson insisted the Trump administration was not advocating ""regime change"" in Venezuela but said it would be ""easiest"" if Maduro chose to leave power on his own.
In his most important regional policy statement since his appointment, Tillerson also warned Latin American countries against excessive reliance on economic ties with China, while sounding alarm over Russia's growing presence.
Tillerson is due to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, and Videgaray for a second time, on Friday, and they are certain to discuss Central American migration and drug trafficking, two areas in which Mexico has sought to work more closely with the United States since U.S. President Donald Trump took office.
Videgaray, who flew to Washington earlier this week ahead of Tillerson's arrival, is Pena Nieto's most trusted adviser, and has forged close ties with Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who serves as a senior advisor to the president.
The influential foreign minister has stepped to the fore of regional Latin American efforts to condemn Maduro's government and has also proved a good friend to the Trump administration on sensitive foreign policy issues including North Korea, Israel and Honduras.
Former Mexican diplomat and intelligence official Gustavo Mohar said it would be foolish to assume such efforts could yield a positive NAFTA result.

""The priority of Mexico's foreign policy in the short-term has been to reach an agreement with the Trump government on trade,"" he said. ""But that doesn't guarantee you anything, because this guy (Trump) is very unpredictable.""

250,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 07:00PM ET</span>",U.S. says Syria may be developing new types of chemical weapons,"By Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Syrian government may be developing new types of chemical weapons, and U.S. President Donald Trump is prepared to consider further military action if necessary to deter chemical attacks, senior U.S. officials said on Thursday.
President Bashar al-Assad is believed to have secretly kept part of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile despite a U.S.-Russian deal under which Damascus was supposed to have handed over all such weapons for destruction in 2014, the officials said.
Assad's forces have instead ""evolved"" their chemical weapons and made continued occasional use of them in smaller amounts since a deadly attack last April that drew a U.S. missile strike on a Syrian air base, the officials told reporters in a briefing.
Characteristics of some of those recent attacks suggest that Syria may be developing new weapons and methods for delivering poison chemicals, possibly to make it harder to trace their origin, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity, but they declined to provide specifics.
A deadly sarin attack on a rebel-held area in April prompted Trump to order a missile strike last year on the Shayrat air base, from which the Syrian operation is said to have been launched.
""We reserve the right to use military force to prevent or deter the use of chemical weapons,"" one official said, while declining to specify how serious a chemical attack would have to be to draw a fresh U.S. military response.
A second official said, however, that the Trump administration hopes that stepped-up international sanctions and diplomatic pressure will help rein in Assad's chemical weapons program.
If the international community does not act quickly to tighten the screws on Assad, Syria's chemical weapons could spread beyond its borders and possibly even ""to U.S. shores,"" the second official said.
""It will spread if we don't do something,"" the official warned.
The officials echoed U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's recent accusation that Russia, Assad's ally in Syria's multi-sided civil war, bears some responsibility for failing to enforce the chemical weapons ban.
Russia has denied any complicity, and the Syrian government has said it has not carried out any of the attacks.
The U.S. officials suggested that if left unchecked there would be more smaller chemical attacks as an ""instrument of terror"" to compensate for Assad's lack of adequate manpower to retake some opposition-held areas.
""They think they can get away with it if they keep it under a certain level,"" an official said.
Western officials have cast suspicion on the Syrian government for a chlorine gas attack on a rebel-held enclave east of Damascus last week that sickened at least 13 people.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Thursday the United States was ""extremely concerned"" about reports that Syrian forces had carried out another chlorine gas attack this week in the eastern Ghouta area.

The U.S. officials also said Islamic State militants have sporadically used chemical weapons such as sulfur mustard and chlorine, some via improvised explosive devices, a more rudimentary tactic than those of the Syrian government.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Myanmar told the United Nations Security Council not to visit during February this year because it was ""not the right time,"" Kuwait's U.N. Ambassador Mansour Ayyad Al-Otaibi said on Thursday, adding that the country did not completely reject the proposed trip.
Nearly 690,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since Aug. 25 last year after the Myanmar military cracked down on insurgents in Rakhine state. 
The security forces have been accused by Rohingya witnesses and rights activists of carrying out killings, rapes and arson in Rakhine in a campaign senior officials in the United Nations and United States have described as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar rejects that label and has denied nearly all the allegations.
Al-Otaibi said he tried to organize a visit to Myanmar during Kuwait's presidency of the Security Council in February.
""This visit will not happen in February. Other members of the council might organize such a visit at a later stage, maybe in March or April,"" Al-Otaibi said. ""They did not reject it ... They just think this is not the right time for the visit.""
""They are currently organizing a visit for the diplomatic corps in Myanmar to the Rakhine state. They also said that tensions are high in the Rakhine state at the moment, these were the reasons given to us by the Myanmar authorities,"" he said. 
In November the 15-member Security Council urged the Myanmar government to stop the excessive use of military force in Rakhine state and expressed ""grave concern over reports of human rights violations and abuses.""
The statement by the council also called on the Myanmar government to give media organizations full and unhindered access throughout the country to ensure the safety and security of medial personnel. 
Two Reuters reporters, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were detained on Dec. 12 and accused of violating the country's Official Secrets Act. They had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in Rakhine state.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will address the United Nations Security Council on Feb. 20 during the body's monthly meeting on the Middle East amid tensions over the United States decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Since President Donald Trump broke from decades of United States policy with his Dec. 6 announcement on Jerusalem, Abbas has said he will ask the council to grant full U.N. membership to the Palestinians and will only accept an internationally-backed panel to broker any peace talks with Israel.
""This will be a good thing for members of the Security Council to listen to the president himself,"" said Kuwait's U.N. Ambassador Mansour Ayyad Al-Otaibi, president of the council for February. ""No council members rejected this proposal.""
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the Security Council last week that Abbas lacked ""the courage and the will to seek peace."" 
Trump has threatened to withhold aid to the Palestinians if they did not pursue peace with Israel but Abbas has said the United States had taken itself ""off the table"" as a peace mediator in recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.
Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon accused Abbas of ""seeking to put an end to any possibility of negotiations with Israel"" with his address to the 15-member Security Council. 
""Abbas is completely misreading today's reality and harming the prospects for a better future for his people,"" Danon said in a statement on Thursday. 
Al-Otaibi said Israel had not yet asked to send a high-level representative to the council meeting.
In 2012, the U.N. General Assembly granted de facto recognition of a sovereign Palestinian state when it upgraded their status to a ""non-member state"" from an ""entity.""
However, the U.N. Security Council has to recommend a state for full membership to the General Assembly, which then needs to approve it with a two-thirds majority. The United States would likely veto a Palestinian bid in the Security Council.
In December the 193-member General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the United States to drop its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

Trump had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that voted in favor. A total of 128 countries backed the resolution, which is non-binding, nine voted against and 35 abstained. Twenty-one countries did not cast a vote.

U.S, Australian and New Zealand aircraft have for several days been scouring the central Pacific Ocean for a life raft believed to be carrying survivors from a 17-metre (56-foot) catamaran reported missing on Jan. 20 after departing Nonouti Island on a 250 km (155 miles) trip to Betio in Kiribati.
The ferry was carrying 88 passengers. 
Seven people that were rescued from a drifting dinghy on the weekend said the ferry broke up soon after setting out and that they had seen other passengers scramble aboard a life raft. But with no further sightings of a lifeboat, the search has now been suspended.
""The Rescue Coordination Centre Nadi and Kiribati have decided that it is no longer appropriate for the air search to continue. The international aircraft will be returning,"" Vince Cholewa, a spokesman for The Rescue Coordination Centre of New Zealand, told Reuters.
Seven aircraft from New Zealand, Australia and the U.S. coastguard have been combing around 92,000 square km (35,500 square miles) of ocean for the missing life raft, which was designed to hold about 25 people but capable of squeezing on more.

Kiribati vessels will continue searching, the government said.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - A debate over gay marriage has upturned Costa Rica's presidential race, giving ammunition to conservative frontrunners ahead of Sunday's vote and challenging the Central American country's image as a progressive bastion. 
Evangelical Christian singer and congressman Fabricio Alvarado, who leads recent polls, has pitted himself against a January ruling from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights that urges Costa Rica to legalize same-sex marriage.
Alvarado, 43, has said the Costa Rica-based court is violating the country's sovereignty and jeopardizing its ""traditional family"" values. He has threatened to withdraw Costa Rica from the court system, as Venezuela did. 
""We are not ready for a LGBT agenda,"" Alvarado said at a candidate debate. ""Let's make February 4 our referendum on the marriage between men and women."" 
His meteoric rise is unlikely to be enough for him to win without a run-off vote in April. But Alvarado has pushed other candidates among the 13 contenders to adopt more conservative tones, including ex-government minister Antonio Alvarez Desanti, leader of the powerful National Liberation party.
Alvarez Desanti, a 59-year-old banana entrepreneur, has pledged to respect the court's decision on gay marriage but said he would not personally support it. That sparked criticism from liberal factions of his center-right party in a country whose ""pura vida,"" catchphrase suggests a chilled approach to life.
Neither Alvarado nor Alvarez Desanti is expected to reach the 40 percent of votes required to win in the first round.
Conservative Juan Diego Castro also hopes to land on the April run-off ballot. The former justice minister is running on a platform of tough anti-crime measures and less restrictions on miners and oil companies in a nation known for stewardship of rainforests and oceans. 
""FEAR OF GOD""
Out of three candidates who support same-sex marriage, the most likely to reach a second round is Carlos Alvarado, a former labor minister and an ally of President Luis Guillermo Solis. 
Solis is barred by law from seeking a second consecutive term.
Despite Costa Rica's reputation as socially forward looking, with high education and health standards, reproductive rights such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and abortion are not widely accepted, and seven out of ten people consider themselves conservative, according to a University of Costa Rica poll. 
""Those who propose gay marriage do not understand Costa Rica,"" said Marcela Linares, 56, as she attended to her stall in a San Jose marketplace presided over by an image of Costa Rica's patron saint. ""This country is not that, here it is marriage between a man and a woman. Here there is fear of God."" 
The gay community has counted some triumphs, however. 
Solis' administration and his Citizen Action Party (PAC) flew a rainbow-striped flag over the presidential house in 2014, the first time a Latin American government raised the gay rights banner over an official building. 
A request from Solis several years ago prompted the Inter-American Court's ruling on legalizing gay marriage.
""There is a hypocritical and electoral use of the resolution of the Inter-American Court. But it works in our favor - those who don't believe in equality will be divided,"" said Marco Castillo, an attorney and leader of the Diversity Movement advocacy group. 
Many of Costa Rica's 3.3 million voters are still unsure who to support, according to polls, after a campaign season marked by skepticism and apathy. 

""I'm going to go vote, but I don't yet know for who,"" said José Esteban Ramírez, a 35-year-old dentist. ""Before, I chose the least-worst, but now it is difficult to know who is the worst.""

An estimated 40,000 people from Tawergha, 38 km (24 miles) south of the port city of Misrata, have been displaced in camps across Libya for more than six years. 
They were chased out by Misratan armed groups in retribution after their town was used by forces loyal to former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi as he attacked Misrata during a Nato-backed uprising. 
Lengthy negotiations led to a plan backed by the internationally recognized government in Tripoli for returns to start at the beginning of February, though the abandoned town is largely ruined and does not have working infrastructure.
About 150 displaced residents had left Benghazi, nearly 700 km east of Tawergha, in a convoy on Wednesday. They said they were prepared to camp in Tawergha if necessary, but turned back to their overnight stopping point in Harawa after trying to advance west toward Sirte, which is controlled by Misratan forces.
""Now we have returned to Harawa because the security situation in the area where we were wasn't good,"" Mohamed al-Tawerghi, a community spokesman, told Reuters. 
Roads between Misrata and Tawergha were also reportedly blocked by Misratan groups.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 04:29PM ET</span>",Trump urges compromise as Republicans wrestle with immigration,"By Steve Holland and Amanda Becker
WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump urged his fellow Republicans on Thursday to put aside misgivings over letting young ""Dreamer"" immigrants stay in the United States and pass a bill that includes that measure but also imposes tough new immigration curbs.
The debate over immigration policy has become closely enmeshed with looming deadlines over government spending. Congress needs to agree by Feb. 8 on another temporary spending bill to keep the government running, and also needs to lift the ceiling on federal debt this month to avoid a government default.
A fight over funding last month led to a three-day government shutdown, resolved in part by a promise by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell to hold a vote on a plan to extend protections for Dreamers - young immigrants brought to the country illegally when they were children.
""To get it done, we'll all have to make some compromises along the way, to get it done this way,"" Trump told lawmakers from his party at a countryside retreat. Republicans control both chambers of Congress, but need support from some Democrats to pass major bills in the Senate.
""We have to be willing to give a little in order for our country to gain a whole lot,"" Trump said.
Trump, whose election success hinged partly on his tough line on immigration, has said he is open to letting 1.8 million Dreamers stay in the country and eventually become citizens.
But he made that offer contingent on new curbs for other types of legal immigrants, and on a $25 billion fund to pay for his long-promised wall along the border with Mexico.
Trump was clear on Thursday that his framework was all or nothing, urging the Senate to include all his terms in their bill. But while some of his terms are unpalatable to Democrats, his proposal is also too liberal for some Republicans.
""He’s dropped away a lot of issues and taken heat from a lot of conservatives,"" said Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma.
The right wing of the party is uneasy about extending what they call ""amnesty"" to anyone living in the United States without authorization.
But some hardline members of the Senate and House of Representatives have said they would go along with this if it is linked to the other measures proposed by Trump, particularly an end to the visa lottery system for certain countries, and new limits on the type of family members immigrants can sponsor to move to the United States.
Many Senate Republicans who have been in talks with Democrats on the issue believe that the focus should be a narrower bill: one that addresses the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and Trump's border wall.
""I think that if we can solve DACA and border security that may be the best I can hope for,"" Senator John Thune, a member of the Republican leadership, told reporters.
'NON-STARTER'
Representative Mark Meadows, head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said however that a pared-back deal would be a ""non-starter"" with conservative House Republicans.
""Listen, we are not going to do a few billion dollars for border security and have the same problem a decade from now, two decades from now,"" Meadows told reporters. ""If we’re going to solve the problem, let’s solve the problem.""
The issue of the Dreamers arose after Trump last year canceled DACA, which former Democratic President Barack Obama had created to protect Dreamers, and gave Congress until March 5 to draft a solution.
That deadline is seen as somewhat artificial because of a federal court ruling last month blocking the rescinding of DACA. The program will remain in effect until the Supreme Court resolves the case, which is unlikely to happen by March 5.
Trump has said he is open to extending the deadline and some Republicans have said they would welcome the idea.
CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS LOOM
The three-day retreat for congressional Republicans, held at a West Virginia resort, is aimed at rallying around legislative priorities before the November elections that will be seen as a referendum on the party's ability to govern and on Trump's presidency.
Republicans had mixed legislative success last year: enacting a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul but failing to make good on a key campaign promise to repeal and replace Obama's signature healthcare law. 
About 700,000 young immigrants signed up for Obama's DACA protections. Trump said his offer to expand the program to 1.8 million people was ""very generous"" and he predicted that Democrats would face backlash in the November elections if they choose to reject it.
""If they don't approve something within that sphere, that means very simply that they're not looking to approve it at all. They want to use it for an election issue, but it's now an election issue that will go to our benefit,"" Trump said.
Many Democrats have slammed Trump's framework. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said last week it held Dreamers ""hostage to a hateful anti-immigrant scheme."" 

All 435 seats in the House and 34 seats in the 100-seat Senate are at stake in November's election. More than 40 Republicans, including nine committee chairmen, have announced they are leaving Congress or will not seek re-election.

Tillerson, in a speech ahead of a visit to Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Jamaica, also said Russia's growing presence in the region was ""alarming as well.""
""Today China is getting a foothold in Latin America. It is using economic statecraft to pull the region into its orbit; the question is at what price,"" Tillerson said at the University of Texas at Austin en route to Mexico.
Tillerson said China was now the largest trading partner with Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Peru and said strong institutions and accountable governments were needed to secure sovereignty against ""potential predatory actors"" arriving in their region.
""While this trade has brought benefits, the unfair trading practices used by many Chinese have also harmed those countries' manufacturing sectors, generating unemployment and lowering wages for workers,"" the U.S. Secretary of State said.
""Latin America does not need new imperial powers that seek only to benefit their own people,"" he said. ""China's state-led model of development is reminiscent of the past. It doesn't have to be this hemisphere's future.""
Tillerson said Russia had continued to sell arms and military equipment to unfriendly governments that ""do not share or respect democratic values."" 
""Our region must be diligent to guard against far-away powers that do not reflect the fundamental values shared in this region,"" he said.

""The United States stands in vivid contrast. We do not seek short term deals with lop-sided returns,"" Tillerson said.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish lawmakers approved a bill on Thursday that would impose jail terms for suggesting Poland was complicit in the Holocaust, drawing concern from the United States and outrage from Israel, which denounced ""any attempt to challenge historical truth"".
Poland's ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) says the bill is needed to protect Poland's reputation and ensure historians recognize that Poles as well as Jews perished under the Nazis. Israeli officials said it criminalizes basic historical facts.
The Senate voted on the bill in the early hours on Thursday and it will now be sent to President Andrzej Duda, who has 21 days to decide whether to sign it into law.
""Death and suffering in German Nazi concentration camps were a shared experience of Jews, Poles and many other nations,"" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said, adding that Poland would never limit debate about the Holocaust.
Deputy Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said on Wednesday before the vote that, ""It is a duty of every Pole to defend the good name of Poland.""
Duda has not said whether he will sign the bill, but has suggested he sympathizes with its aims. He told state television on Monday: ""The matter needs to be explained calmly, but we absolutely cannot backtrack."" 
The bill would impose three years prison sentences for mentioning the term ""Polish death camps"", although it says scientific research into World War Two would not be constrained.
Israel ""adamantly opposes"" the bill's approval, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.
""Israel views with utmost gravity any attempt to challenge historical truth. No law will change the facts,"" ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said on Twitter.
Israeli Housing Minister Yoav Galant, one of several cabinet ministers to denounce the bill, told Israel's Army Radio that he considered it ""de facto Holocaust denial"". 
Israel also requested on Thursday the postponement of a planned visit next week by the head of Poland's National Security Bureau.
The Polish bill has come at a time when right wing, anti-immigrant parties like PiS have been in the ascendancy in Europe, especially in the former Communist countries of the east. EU officials have expressed alarm over the PiS administration in Poland, which they say has undermined the rule of law by exerting pressure over the courts and media.
The socially conservative, nationalist PiS has reignited debate on the Holocaust as part of a campaign to fuel patriotism since sweeping into power in 2015.
The U.S. State Department said the legislation ""could undermine free speech and academic discourse"" and Washington was concerned about the repercussions it could have ""on Poland's strategic interests and relationships"".
Piotr Buras, head of the Warsaw office of the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank, told Reuters the bill could push Poland further toward nationalism and isolation.
""The president will have to sign it - otherwise it would mean he is giving into international pressure. But the external criticism will, of course, push the government further into the position of a besieged fortress, strengthening both the nationalistic rhetoric...and the nationalistic mood in the country.""
PAINFUL DEBATE
Poland had Europe's largest Jewish population when it was invaded by both Germany and the Soviet Union at the start of World War Two. It became ground zero for the ""Final Solution"", Hitler's plan to exterminate the Jews.
More than three million of Poland's 3.2 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis, accounting for around half of the Jews killed in the Holocaust. Jews from across Europe were sent to be killed at death camps built and operated by the Germans on Polish soil, including Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor.
According to figures from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Germans also killed at least 1.9 million non-Jewish Polish civilians.
Many thousands of Poles risked their lives to protect their Jewish neighbors; Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust center recognizes 6,706 Poles as ""righteous among nations"" for bravery in resisting the Holocaust, more than any other nationality.
But Poland has also gone through a painful public debate in recent years after the publication of research showing some Poles participated in the Nazi atrocities. Many Poles have refused to accept such findings, which have challenged a national narrative that the country was solely a victim.
A 2017 survey by the Polish Center for Research on Prejudice showed that more than 55 percent of Poles were ""annoyed"" by talk of Polish participation in crimes against Jews.
Poland has long sought to discourage use of the term ""Polish camps"" to refer to Nazi camps on its territory, arguing that the phrase implies complicity.
European Council President Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister and political foe of the PiS, said the bill had the opposite of its intended effect, tarnishing Poland's name and encouraging the view of history it aimed to criminalize.

""Anyone who spreads a false statement about 'Polish camps' harms the good name and interests of Poland,"" Tusk said on Twitter. ""The authors of the bill have promoted this vile slander all over the world, effectively as nobody has before.""

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Three private Kenyan television channels remained off air despite a court order on Thursday that they be allowed to resume broadcasting, overturning a government-ordered shut down.
Authorities turned off the three channels as they began to cover opposition leader Raila Odinga's symbolic presidential inauguration on Tuesday.
NTV Kenya, three of whose journalists said they had spent the night in their newsroom in fear of arrest, said on its Twitter feed that the privately owned broadcasters were expected back on air after the High Court ruling.
""Government expected to restore NTV, Citizen TV & KTN News signals after High Court suspends switch off for 14 days pending case being heard,"" it tweeted.
No government spokesmen were available to explain why the three channels were still off air at 2000 GMT, around eight hours after the judgment was given.
The government shut down the TV channels on Tuesday as they began coverage of a rally during which Odinga -- who says last year's elections, won by President Uhuru Kenyatta, were rigged -- declared himself president in a brief, symbolic ceremony. 
The shutdown, unprecedented in Kenya's democratic era, prompted fierce public criticism and raised fears the country was reverting to the censorship that characterized decades of repressive one-party rule under strongman Daniel arap Moi. 
The court's decision -- to suspend the shutdown for two weeks while a case challenging the legality of the government's action is heard -- will boost the newly-independent judiciary's image in East Africa's regional powerhouse and wealthiest economy. 
The government's attempted censorship made global headlines about a country that is valued by investors for its stability, relative freedom and steady economic growth. 
""This is clearly a slide to dictatorship. It's a return to a repressive period we had forgotten about,"" NTV journalist Larry Madowo told Reuters. ""We are becoming another African country."" 
BLOODY CLASHES
NTV journalist Ken Mijungu told Reuters that he and colleagues Madowo and Linus Kaikai had all been warned by security sources on Wednesday that their arrest was imminent. 
In African states with entrenched rulers such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon, governments have asked telecommunications companies to block social media, mainly during elections and protests.
On Wednesday, the Kenyan government had said the TV stations would stay off air indefinitely. 
Interior Minister Fred Matiang'i accused media organizations of facilitating Odinga's ""illegal act"", which he said put the lives of thousands of Kenyans at risk. [L8N1PQ3JZ] 
Clashes between Odinga supporters and security forces claimed around 100 lives during the election season. Almost all were killed by the police. 
Also on Wednesday, police arrested opposition lawmaker Tom Kajwang for illegally administering Odinga's ""oath"". He was expected to be charged on Thursday oath but was taken out of court by police before the charges were read. He was later freed on a 50,000 Kenyan shilling ($500) bond. 
Kenyatta won an Aug. 8 election that was later nullified by the Supreme Court over irregularities. A repeat election was held on Oct. 26, but Odinga boycotted it because he said the electoral commission had made insufficient reforms. 
Kenyatta won with more than 98 percent of the vote. 
Odinga, whom the government accuses of trying to force a bloody confrontation with the authorities, gave no hint in his five-minute speech at Tuesday's rally about future actions and deflected questions on Thursday about his next move. 
""We want (ruling party) Jubilee to accept that they lost the election,"" he told a news conference, promising to release details of his plan the next day. 
The opposition leader accused the government of suspending the constitution by attacking the media, and batted away suggestions his staged inauguration was a bid to seize power. 
""I am not a megalomaniac. I am a very reasonable Kenyan,"" Odinga said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday strong economic growth offered scope to further expand government spending, which could help her conservatives hammer out a coalition deal with the Social Democrats.
The government this week raised its 2018 growth forecast to 2.4 percent from 1.9 percent after bullish economic data, which could translate into added tax revenues.
That would give more leeway to increase state spending over the next four years beyond what is currently envisaged in coalition talks, and potentially lower taxes. 
Merkel, speaking after a meeting with leaders of the country's 16 state governments, said the revised growth forecast clearly offered ""additional margin"" for coalition negotiators.
Talks on ending over four months of political limbo are seen likely to stretch into next week despite agreements on migration and pensions, politicians said on Thursday. 
Investors worry the long failure to form a new government is delaying reforms at home and in the European Union, after an earlier attempt at a coalition with smaller parties collapsed in November.
Senior negotiatiors will meet again late on Thursday to discuss education, digital matters, finances and health care.
To secure a fourth term in office, Merkel needs the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) to agree to a re-run of the ""grand coalition"" that has ruled Europe's biggest economy since 2013. 
The party's roughly 440,000 members could yet sink any deal as they have the final say in a ballot.
The JUSOS youth wing of the SPD and other leftist members are deeply opposed to rejoining a coalition under Merkel, fearing it will decimate their support.
A new poll by infratest dimap showed the SPD would win only 18 percent of the vote if new elections were held on Sunday, a drop of three percentage points from last month, and well below the 20.5 percent the party won in the September elections. 
But the prospect of added spending could allow negotiators to fund new education and digitalization projects that could appease some leftist SPD voters.
Negotiators reached agreement on Thursday on pension contributions, adding to consensus already reached on climate goals and family reunions for migrants. Differences remain on labor law, health reforms and taxes.
They agreed to guarantee a pension level of 48 percent of average income, with contributions to be capped at 20 percent.
Horst Seehofer, the combative conservative leader of Bavaria, remained skeptical about boosting additional government spending beyond a planned 46 billion euros through 2021, the basis of a blueprint agreed in exploratory talks last month.
On Thursday, Germany's lower house of parliament voted to extend a ban on reunions of migrants until the end of July, agreed by would-be coalition partners just two days ago. The existing suspension, introduced in 2016, had been due to expire.

Merkel's Bavarian allies have dug in their heels against more generous migrant policies demanded by the SPD.

Belykh, who denied the charges, was governor of the Kirov region north-east of Moscow. Unusually for a senior Russian official, he had an opposition background and hired outspoken Kremlin critics as aides in his administration.
Several people who know Belykh have told Reuters the governor was vulnerable to prosecution because he was an outsider to the Kremlin system and, as a liberal reformer, at odds with many of the security hawks in the Kremlin.
He was arrested on the evening of June 24, 2016 in Megu, an upscale Japanese restaurant in central Moscow. Law enforcement officials said they caught him red-handed taking 150,000 euros ($187,440) in cash from Yuri Zyudheimer, owner of a timber business in Kirov.
Prosecutors said the money, and cash Belykh received on other occasions, was a bribe in return for favourable treatment for Zyudheimer's company. 
Belykh's lawyers said he took the money not for himself but as a contribution towards a programme to beautify the regional capital. Russian officials have denied that Belykh's prosecution was politically motivated.

Those on trial in a special international court in the capital Niamey come from Niger, Nigeria and Chad and are suspected of playing a role in Boko Haram's near decade-long bid to create a caliphate in Nigeria. 
The Islamist insurgency has spread beyond its roots in Nigeria, killing 20,000 and uprooting nearly 3 million in the Lake Chad region.
The Niamey trials follow closed-door Boko Haram trials, including in Nigeria where a court in October jailed 45 people to between three and 31 years in jail, but the government did not say what they were convicted of.
Open trials are meant to show that suspected fighters will be given due process, and could also help alleviate a conflict that has been stoked at times by the mistreatment of captives. 
The death in 2009 of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf in police custody is seen as one of the major triggers for the conflict.
The Niamey court will hear 22 separate cases over the next 10 days, following the trial of nearly 300 people on similar charges last year. In all, nearly 1,000 people are expected to come before the court.

Warplanes and helicopters struck in Idlib, Hama and Aleppo provinces, including in the towns of Saraqeb and Kafr Nabouda, said the war monitor, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. 
The Syrian army and its allies are pushing toward Saraqeb from Abu Duhur, an airbase they captured last month, and they seized several villages on Thursday, the Observatory said.
The strongest rebel group in northwest Syria is Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of jihadist factions including a former al Qaeda affiliate previously known as the Nusra Front. 
In Damascus, shelling by rebel groups killed seven people and wounded 13 others in the government-held Ash al-Warour district, state news agency SANA reported. 
The government has pushed rebels from many of the areas they seized during the civil war, which began in 2011, but opposition groups still hold significant pockets near Damascus and Homs and in the southwest, as well as the enclave in the northwest.

268,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 12:53PM ET</span>",Reuters reporters arrested under Myanmar Secrets Act denied bail,"By Thu Thu Aung and Yimou Lee
YANGON (Reuters) - A court in Myanmar declined to grant bail on Thursday for two Reuters journalists accused of violating the country's Official Secrets Act, although their defense lawyer said information in documents at the center of the case was publicly available.
Lawyer Than Zaw Aung said a police witness had accepted during court proceedings that details in documents found in the possession of the reporters when they were arrested had already been published in newspaper reports.
Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in Rakhine state, where an army crackdown on insurgents that started on Aug. 25 has triggered the flight of nearly 690,000 Rohingya Muslims to neighboring Bangladesh, according to the United Nations.
The reporters were detained on Dec. 12 after they had been invited to meet police officers over dinner in Yangon. They have told relatives they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some documents at a restaurant by two officers they had not met before.
Police Major Min Thant, who said he led the team of arresting officers, on Thursday submitted what he said were secret documents seized from the two reporters to the district court in Yangon.
Police have previously said the documents contained information on the disposition and operations of security forces in Rakhine's Maungdaw district.
In response, defense attorney Than Zaw Aung submitted copies of several newspaper articles that he said showed the information in the documents was already in the public domain.
""After Aug. 25, the government explained to the media and diplomats about what happened in Maungdaw,"" Than Zaw Aung said.
(GRAPHIC: Arrested Reuters Reporters - http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/MYANMAR-JOURNALIST-PROFILE/0100602S055/index.html) 
He said afterwards that Major Min Thant had acknowledged that when cross-examined.
""The witness admitted that the content of the documents they obtained from them is the information that the public already knew. He said the contents are same,"" Than Zaw Aung told Reuters.
CALLS FOR RELEASE
At the end of the day's proceedings, the court rejected the defense's application for bail. Reading from the Official Secrets Act, Judge Ye Lwin said the alleged offense was ""non-bailable"", without elaborating further.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the international community ""to do whatever it can"" to secure the release of two Reuters journalists detained in Myanmar and ensure press freedom in the country, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Thursday.
Reuters President and Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler expressed disappointment at the decision and called for the journalists' prompt release.
""It has now been more than fifty days since they were arrested, and they should have the opportunity to be with their families as the hearings continue,"" he said in a statement.
""We believe the court proceedings will demonstrate their innocence and Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo will be able to return to their jobs reporting on events in Myanmar.""
Relatives of the two reporters were distraught after the decision was announced.
""I cleaned my house with the hope that he might get bail, just in case,"" Pan Ei Mon, Wa Lone's wife, said, sobbing. ""I knew that he wouldn't get bail but still I cannot handle this.""
Kyaw Soe Oo's wife, Chit Su Win, held on to him in tears, kissing him as he was being taken back to prison.
In the morning, the two journalists had been smiling and appeared in good spirits as they were brought handcuffed to the court from Yangon's notorious Insein prison. Wa Lone gave the ""thumbs up"" sign and Kyaw Soe Oo hugged his young daughter.
The courtroom was packed with reporters and diplomats from the U.S., British, Canadian, Norwegian, Swedish, French and Danish embassies as well as United Nations and European Union officials.
DIFFERENT LOCATIONS
Under cross-examination, police witness Min Thant also said he had updated the paperwork recording Kyaw Soe Oo's arrest and search to show he was detained outside the restaurant where the reporters say they had a meal with police officers.
Kyaw Soe Oo had refused to sign a form stating he was arrested at an intersection in northern Yangon where police say they had a checkpoint, the officer said. 
The two journalists said afterwards that Min Thant was not among the officers who arrested them.
""We have never seen that police officer before,"" Wa Lone told reporters outside the courtroom. ""We were arrested by plainclothes police.""
In his testimony, Min Thant said he led the team that arrested the reporters and that he was in uniform at the time.
The court hearing is to determine whether Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo will face charges under the Official Secrets Act. 
The act dates back to 1923 - when Myanmar, then known as Burma, was under British rule - and carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
The reporters have been accused under Section 3.1 (c), which covers entering prohibited places, and taking images or obtaining secret official documents that ""might be or is intended to be, directly or indirectly, useful to an enemy"".

The next hearing will be on Feb. 6.

270,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>","In new EU sea mission, ships not obliged to bring migrants to Italy","By Steve Scherer
ROME (Reuters) - The European Union's border agency Frontex launched a new Mediterranean operation called Themis on Thursday, removing the obligation of the previous mission to bring rescued migrants only to Italy.
Italy has repeatedly lamented a lack of EU solidarity in managing immigration. The previous Frontex operation, called Triton, required all those rescued at sea to be brought to Italy even if another EU country, such as Malta, was closer.
""Triton said that whomever rescued would be taken to Italy,"" said Izabella Cooper, a spokeswoman for Frontex. ""Themis leaves the decision on disembarkation to the (country) coordinating a particular rescue."" 
Triton was a Greek god and the messenger of the sea, while Themis was the goddess of divine law and order.
Since Italy coordinates the vast majority of sea rescues between North Africa and its southern coast, the new rule is unlikely have a large impact on arrivals, though it does send a political message to Mediterranean neighbors like Malta.
Maltese authorities had no immediate comment. 
With more than 600,000 migrants landing on Italian shores in the last four years, a popular backlash is building ahead of a March 4 national election, and the center-left government is under pressure to show it has the situation in hand.
The new Frontex operation will put more focus on law enforcement.
""Operation Themis will better reflect the changing patterns of migration, as well as cross border crime,"" Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri said in a statement. ""Frontex will also assist Italy in tracking down criminal activities, such as drug smuggling across the Adriatic."" 
The one-year mission will be re-evaluated every three months and will, unlike Triton, include Italy's southern Adriatic coast. While the operational area of Triton extended about 30 miles from the Italian coast, Themis vessels typically will not patrol further than 24 miles from the coast.
While Triton was not a search-and-rescue operation, it has assisted in the rescue of 38,000 people since 2014. Themis vessels, of which there will be more than 10 operating in the summer, will also carry out rescues if asked, Cooper said.
No rescued migrants will be taken to non-EU countries, like Libya or Tunisia, she said. 
Italian newspapers suggested on Thursday that migrants would be taken to the ""closest port"", but Cooper said international maritime law, which foresees they be taken to the nearest ""place of safety"", would continue to be followed.
In January, 4,256 migrants reached Italy by sea, a 6 percent decline on the same month last year. Arrivals from Libya, where most people smugglers operate, were down almost 26 percent.
Italy sealed a deal a year ago with the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli to provide aid, equipment and training to help Libya fight smuggling.
Arrivals plummeted by two thirds during the second half of last year as armed groups cracked down on trafficking from Sabratha, a smuggling hub, and as the Libyan coast guard intercepted an increasing number of boats.

More than a million Syrians fled into neighboring Lebanon after war broke out in their country in 2011 and now account for about a quarter of its population. 
As the Syrian government has gained control over more territory, and as fighting has ended in more parts of Syria, some Lebanese politicians have called for Syrian refugees to return. 
""My government's position is very clear. Nobody's going to force anyone to go back if they don't want to go back,"" Hariri said. 
In a speech at a donor conference in Beirut calling for $2.68 billion in humanitarian aid for the crisis this year, Hariri warned that refugees would try to move to other countries if there was not enough support for them in Lebanon. 
""We need more from the international community because we are doing a public service for the international community. Otherwise these people, if we do not do more, if you do not do more, they will seek refuge somewhere else,"" he said.

Three ex-combatants of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and one of their relatives were killed on Wednesday in a rural area La Florida, in Narino province.
The jungle and mountain region bordering Ecuador is rife with illegal armed groups such as the ELN, or National Liberation Army, which fight for control of illegal mining and drug trafficking routes in areas once teeming with the FARC.
The FARC, which kept its acronym by changing its name to the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force, signed a peace accord in late 2016, putting an end to its part in a conflict that has killed more than 220,000 people over five decades.
""Everything indicates that those responsible for the crime are active members of the National Liberation Army that operates in that region of the country,"" the FARC said in a statement. ""We urgently request the ELN publicly clarifies the information.""
Under the peace accord, more than 11,000 combatants turned in their weapons and formed a political party that will present 74 candidates for legislative elections in March as well as its former leader, Rodrigo Londono, as presidential candidate in May.
Similar peace talks with the ELN were suspended on Monday by President Juan Manuel Santos after the insurgent group launched a series of bomb attacks against police targets, killing seven and injuring dozens.
The 2,000-strong ELN and the government had been in peace talks for a year, and the two sides agreed to their first-ever ceasefire in October. But the rebels launched a new offensive when the ceasefire expired last month, killing members of the armed forces, bombing major oil pipelines and kidnapping an oil contractor.
The ELN, founded by radical Roman Catholic priests in 1964, has sought peace with the government before but made little progress. It is considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union.
FARC leaders have expressed fear of a systematic campaign to assassinate militants and leaders of their political party, as happened with the Patriotic Union, a leftist organization that lost some 5,000 of its members in attacks attributed to right-wing paramilitaries in 1985.
According to the FARC, 39 ex-combatants have been assassinated since the peace agreement was signed, in addition to 14 family members.

273,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>","East Libyan groups targeting displaced families, preventing returns: HRW","By Aidan Lewis
TUNIS (Reuters) - Armed groups, some linked with prominent Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar, are preventing thousands of displaced families from returning to the eastern city of Benghazi, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a report published on Thursday.
Groups affiliated to Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) have seized property from displaced families, and tortured, abducted or arrested people who tried to resist, HRW said it had heard from their relatives. 
The LNA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month, Haftar issued a statement denouncing attacks on private property and calling for LNA forces to help the displaced return. 
The LNA prevailed last year in a long military campaign against Islamists and other opponents of Haftar for control of Benghazi. Haftar has emerged as the dominant figure in eastern Libya and is a likely presidential candidate in elections that the United Nations says it wants to hold by the end of the year.
The war in Benghazi was part of a wider conflict that developed in Libya after a 2011 uprising ended more than four decades of rule by Muammar Gaddafi, and has seen tens of thousands of people displaced across the country. 
Since the start of Haftar's ""Dignity Operation"" in May 2014, around 13,000 families have fled Benghazi, and at least 3,700 families are being blocked from returning, HRW said, citing local activists.
The rights group called on Haftar to end the attacks against civilians. ""Senior LNA commanders who have stood by since 2014 while their forces torture and disappear people and plunder their property can and should be held to account by local or international courts,"" Eric Goldstein, HRW's deputy Middle East and North Africa director, said in a statement.
KILLINGS
Some displaced families interviewed by HRW said they were unable to return to Benghazi due to threats even though none of their relatives had fought against the LNA. Most said their families had been targeted on the pretext that they or their relatives were linked to Islamic State.
HRW said five relatives of interviewees were among 36 victims found in the town of Al-Abyar in October, the worst in a series of such incidents.
""We are now seeing a very frightening acceleration of extra-judicial killing, or people who appear to be prisoners, appear to be alive when they are caught, and the family loses track of them and then they turn up dead,"" HRW senior Libya researcher Hanan Salah said by phone.
""We are continuously documenting the exact same cases of people who disappear at night, whose parents are then afraid to go look for them, and who turn up dead in a dump.""
In some cases, the fact that families long resident in Benghazi had origins in western Libya and particularly in Misrata, a bastion of opposition to Haftar, was used against them, said Salah.
""This is going to make any future settlement very difficult, and future reconciliation or accountability very, very difficult,"" she said.

On Wednesday Israel described as ""very provocative"" Lebanon's first offshore oil and gas exploration tender and said it would be a mistake for international firms to participate.
Lebanon is on the Levant Basin in the eastern Mediterranean where a number of big sub-sea gas fields have been discovered since 2009, including fields located in Israeli waters near the disputed border with Lebanon. 
After meeting Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, Aoun tweeted, quoting Hariri as saying Lebanon was ""confronting a big aggression relating to Lebanon's oil wealth"". 
Aoun said he and parliament speaker Nabih Berri had agreed to meet to discuss steps to confront ""repeated Israeli threats"" and called on Berri to ""turn the page"" on tensions between their political factions. 

A row over comments about Berri by Aoun's son-in-law, Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, has exacerbated a political standoff, threatening to ignite sectarian tensions in Lebanon before a planned election in May, and to paralyze government.

Participants at Tuesday's meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi in Russia - which is a powerful supporter of President Bashar al-Assad - agreed to set up a committee to change the Syrian constitution, and called for democratic elections.
The main Syrian opposition negotiating group had boycotted the gathering, while the United States, Britain and France also stayed away because of what they said was the Syrian government's refusal to properly engage.
However, chief opposition negotiator Nasr Hariri said the Syrian Negotiation Commission would ""work positively"" with the proposed committee because responsibility for setting it up had been handed to the U.N. Syria envoy, Staffan de Mistura. 
""If the constitutional committee is set up... within the U.N. process in Geneva, strictly consistent with U.N. resolution 2254, yes we will continue to work with the U.N. process in this regard,"" he told a news conference.
Damascus welcomed the results of the Sochi meeting. 
""The final statement of the conference confirmed the consensus of Syrians on ... preserving the sovereignty and unity of Syrian territory and people, and the exclusive right of the Syrian people to choose their own political and economic system,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
It made no mention of the decision to set up a committee to rewrite the constitution or the call for democratic elections. 
Four years of on-off United Nations-mediated peace talks have yielded little progress toward ending the seven-year war, but De Mistura has pressed ahead with efforts for a political solution.

He said on Tuesday the constitutional committee agreed in Sochi ""will become a reality in Geneva"", where most of the U.N.-led Syria peace talks have been held. De Mistura also said he would decide the criteria for committee members and select about 50 people - from government, opposition and independent groups.

The United States, by far the largest contributor to UNRWA, announced on Jan. 16 that Washington would withhold $65 million of $125 million it had planned for the agency this year. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions from U.N. member states.
U.S. President Donald Trump has questioned the value of such funding, and the State Department said the agency needed to make unspecified reforms.
""It is no secret that this trend poses a threat to the refugee issue ... as well as the negative consequences that will not only affect the receiving countries of refugees, but also the stability and security of the region,"" Aboul Gheit said at an Arab League meeting.
More than half of the two million people in Gaza are dependent on support from UNRWA and other humanitarian agencies. Palestinians say the funding decision could deepen hardship in the Gaza Strip, where the unemployment rate is 46 percent.

UNRWA was established by the U.N. General Assembly in 1949 after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war that followed Israel’s creation.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece will soon submit draft proposals to resolve its decades-old name row with Macedonia, its foreign minister said, adding that a settlement could be reached in the coming months. 
The two countries have agreed to step up negotiations this year to resolve the dispute, which has frustrated the ambitions of Greece's small northern neighbor to join NATO and the European Union. Greece is a member of both.
Greece objects to the former Yugoslav republic's use of the name Macedonia, arguing that it, along with contentious articles in Skopje's constitution, could imply territorial claims over its own northern region of the same name.
Greeks are proud of their links to Macedonian empire-builder Alexander the Great, who spread Hellenistic culture across the ancient world.
""In life, Alexander the Great ... proved we should cut Gordian knots. At some point we should finish with such issues,"" Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias told Reuters in an interview.
Asked what would constitute progress for Athens if the dispute with Skopje was not settled by June, he said: ""It will be settled."" 
Talks between the two states have been inconclusive since 1991, when Macedonia withdrew from former Yugoslavia. It was admitted into the United Nations in 1993 under the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).
Kotzias said there was a new momentum to settle the dispute since a more moderate government was elected in Macedonia last year and following three years of trust-building efforts.
""We want to solve it. It's in our national interest and in the interests of the region, for stability, security and economic growth,"" Kotzias said. 
Kotzias said Athens was working on a draft which could form the basis of discussion.
""It won't be a Greek text containing only our views, nor a done deal-compromise. It will be a text which we consider could be the basis upon which we could start to cooperate,"" he said.
Kotzias said he hoped the draft would be ready in February.
For Athens, the name Macedonia refers to a large area of the central Balkans, most of which lies in Greece. 
The most profound difference between the two sides was over references in Skopje's national constitution, Kotzias said. Greece perceives them as implying territorial claims and says they must be changed.
""LINGUISTIC ACROBATICS""
More than 140 countries worldwide refer to the republic as Macedonia. 
Greece has previously said a compromise could include a compound name with a geographical or chronological qualifier, and be the only name used for the country. 
But the leftist-led government has failed to muster wider political support for its negotiating stance or for any suggested name that includes the word Macedonia. 
""Let me tell you a paradox. Let's say we don't reach agreement today, what name is left?"" said Kotzias when asked about that lack of support.
""Internationally, we will be left with plain 'Macedonia', therefore we will have no gain, and in our (bilateral) relations left with 'Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia',"" he added.
""Grammatically, it's a name which still includes the name Macedonia, which is compound and with chronological definition. So we are just fooling ourselves with linguistic acrobatics.""
Hundreds of thousands of Greeks turned out at a demonstration on Jan. 21 against any use by the neighboring state of the name Macedonia. It was on a scale rarely seen in protests against the eight years of austerity foisted upon Greece by its international lenders.
""The demonstrations are signs of democracy. In both countries, people who do not agree to a good compromise ... do not have bad intent,"" Kotzias said. 
""They are simply people who see the problem from a different angle, without taking into account the historical (background) or future cooperation prospects,"" he added.
""We have to respect this history and learn from it, but not be trapped in it.""
A U.N. special envoy said in Skopje on Thursday it was ""time for a decision"" on the dispute.
""This is the right time for a breakthrough on this issue, to solve it finally and move forward in the region,"" Matthew Nimetz told reporters.

""The momentum is now. We probably have weeks and months.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - A U.S. special envoy said on Thursday all options remain on the table for solving the crisis over North Korea's nuclear missile program but that he did not think the Trump administration was close to triggering military action.
Joseph Yun, the U.S. special envoy on North Korea, said the United States was seeking a peaceful resolution and diplomacy was its preferred option.
""Our policy is very much for the peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear crisis. We've said over and over again that what we want to see is dialogue,"" Yun told reporters in Tokyo.
""Having said that, we also have said that all options are on the table and by all options, it has to include military options,"" he said. ""I don't believe we are close to it.""
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has refused to give up development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States in spite of increasingly severe U.N. sanctions, raising fears of a new war on the Korean peninsula.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said it prefers a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
However, Trump has exchanged insults and threats with Kim and U.S. officials have said he and his advisers have discussed a preventative ""bloody nose"" strike on North Korea, alarming experts who warn that this could trigger catastrophic retaliation, especially on South Korea.
In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Trump branded North Korea's leadership as ""depraved"" and said that Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear missiles could ""very soon threaten"" the American homeland. [nL2N1PQ073]
Trump vowed to prevent that, but offered no new specifics on how he intended to rein in North Korea.
On Tuesday, the White House said it was no longer considering Victor Cha, a former official who has questioned the wisdom of a preventative strike, for the post of the next U.S. ambassador to South Korea. 
Cha said on Tuesday such a strike carried a huge risk of escalating into a war that could kill hundreds of thousands of Americans.
U.S. officials have said the debate on military action has lost some momentum as a result of rare talks between North and South Korea launched last month to bring North Koreans to this month's Winter Olympics in the South.

Yun welcomed the North-South dialogue and hoped it was a trend of things to come but said any talks with Washington would have to ""be about steps North Korea would take toward denuclearisation"".

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Suspected Balkan crime boss Naser Kelmendi was sentenced to six years in prison in Kosovo on Thursday for trafficking drugs, but cleared of murder, organized crime and other charges.
The Kosovo-born ethnic Albanian with Bosnian citizenship was blacklisted in 2012 by U.S. authorities, who have accused him of heading a family network distributing heroin and other drugs through Afghanistan to Turkey and into Europe.
He was arrested a year later in Kosovo on a warrant issued by Bosnia, where prosecutors accused him of a string of crimes in their territory.
But he stayed in Kosovo, as the two countries do not have an extradition agreement. His case was handled by judges from an EU mission, who take cases seen as too sensitive for the local judiciary.
The 61-year-old was convicted of drug trafficking but acquitted on eight other counts including participating in organized crime and aggravated murder.
Organized crime flourished in the Balkans during the ethnic wars that followed Yugoslavia’s break-up in the 1990s, leaving the region awash with weapons and a transit route for drug traffickers.
Bosnia prosecutors had accused him of involvement in the 2007 killing of Ramiz Delalic, a Bosnian Muslim warlord who switched to organized crime after the wars in the Balkans.
He denied all the charges, which also included the possession, distribution and sale of drugs. 

Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 but Bosnia has not recognized it because of resistance from its Serb-dominated autonomous region, which comprises a half of the country and wants to show solidarity with Serbia.

Darren Osborne, 48, drove the hired vehicle into a group of Muslims gathered around father-of-six Makram Ali, 51, who had collapsed near his home after leaving late-night Ramadan prayers in Finsbury Park.
He killed Ali and injured 12 others, two seriously. At Woolwich Crown Court, Osborne was found guilty of murder and attempted murder, with police and prosecutors saying it was an act of terrorism. 
It was the fourth incident blamed on terrorists in Britain in the space of three months and it followed three Islamist attacks.
Osborne, who had not previously expressed far-right views, developed an obsession with Muslims after watching the BBC program ""Three Girls"", a drama broadcast last May about events in Rochdale, northern England, where white girls were abused by gangs of mainly British Pakistani men. 
This hatred was subsequently fueled by online research into extreme right-wing figures and groups, police said.

Militants from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) attacked troops positioned in northern Iraq, killing two soldiers and wounding two, the military said. A third soldier was killed and five wounded in the Cukurca district of Hakkari when militants attacked a military base, it said.
The PKK, which has waged an insurgency in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast since the 1980s, has camps in the Qandil mountains of northern Iraq, from which it frequently carries out attacks in nearby Hakkari.
The group is viewed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. More than 40,000 people, most of them Kurds, have been killed in the conflict.
Local media later reported that another two soldiers were killed and two wounded in the Semdinli district of Hakkari, in what appeared to be a separate incident.
The military said it had killed 49 militants in air strikes in northern Iraq on Monday. The strikes were carried out in six regions of northern Iraq and targeted shelters, hideouts and weapons stocks, the military said.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African President Jacob Zuma will meet the top six officials of the ruling party over his future this weekend, the state broadcaster said on Thursday, adding to speculation Zuma could be removed as head of state.
Scandal-plagued Zuma has faced calls from within the African National Congress (ANC) to step down since deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa succeeded him as leader of the party in December. Ramaphosa would then be his natural successor.
""The meeting is expected to center around Zuma's future as head of state,"" the South African Broadcasting Corporation posted on its official news feed.
The ANC has previously said it has discussed Zuma resigning before the end of his term in mid-2019, although his staunch supporters within the party say that will not happen.
Zuma, 75, is currently battling a string of corruption allegations and Ramaphosa has in recent weeks pledged to make tackling graft one of his top priorities.
The National Prosecuting Agency (NPA), the state prosecutor, said on Thursday that Zuma had provided arguments on why he should not be prosecuted for corruption. 
Zuma, who has faced and denied numerous corruption allegations since taking office, submitted documents on Wednesday night to the NPA providing reasons why 783 counts of corruption relating to a 30 billion rand ($2 billion) arms deal arranged in the late 1990s should not be reinstated.
NPA Head Shaun Abrahams ""personally received the representations from the legal representatives of Mr Zuma late yesterday evening"" and would announce the next course of action later, the NPA's spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku said.
Zuma's ties to the Gupta family -- whose members include a trio of businessmen accused of using their ties to Zuma to amass wealth and influence government policy -- has drawn criticism from former allies as well as opponents. The Guptas and Zuma deny any wrongdoing.
Zuma has seen a reversal of fortune since Ramaphosa succeeded him as ANC leader. Zuma still retains the support of a faction within the ANC, but no longer holds a top post.
The opposition has called for Zuma to be removed from office before delivering the State of the Nation Address on Feb 8. 
South Africa's parliament said Zuma will deliver the speech as planned.

""There are processes going on, every day and every night, and at this point the information we have is that the head of state is President Jacob Zuma,"" Baleka Mbete, the speaker of parliament, told reporters.

PARIS (Reuters) - The Paris prosecutor has begun an investigation into whether lives were put in danger when an engine explosion forced an Air France Airbus A380 to make an emergency landing in Canada. 
Airbus and Air France both said on Thursday they would cooperate with the inquiry that was requested by a group of 11 passengers on board the Paris to Los Angeles flight last September. 
""Airbus will provide full technical assistance to the authorities,"" the European aircraft maker said in an emailed statement.
The complaint was filed against unknown persons, a judicial source said. Nobody was injured in the incident.
France's air accident investigations agency (BEA) has said the engine's main fan and inlet become detached when the engine came apart high over Greenland. Damage was limited to the right outer no. 4 engine and its immediate surroundings.
An Air France spokesman said the airline did not rule out filing its own complaint once the BEA investigation is completed.
The GP7200 engines used on Air France A380s are made by Engine Alliance, co-owned by  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and Pratt & Whitney.
Such engine accidents are rare. In 2010, a Qantas A380 made an emergency landing in Singapore after a Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) engine exploded shortly after take-off. Investigators blamed a poorly manufactured part.

A police statement did not name any targets of the investigation, but said they included managers at the Postalis fund, executives at a foreign financial institution, listed companies and risk-assessment firms.
Postalis suffered large losses as a result of embezzlement, police said in the statement.
Postalis representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The pension fund came under federal management last year due to alleged fraud.
Representatives for the Brazilian unit of Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp confirmed that federal police had visited its offices on Thursday as part of an investigation, adding that the bank was cooperating with authorities.
Last month, prosecutors asked the local unit of BNY Mellon, which managed part of the assets held by Postalis, to return 8.2 billion reais ($2.6 billion) to the pension fund. According to prosecutors, BNY had failed to monitor risks and did not comply with local asset-allocation rules. At the time, the unit called those accusations ""unfounded"".

LONDON (Reuters) - Three Catalan independence leaders being held in pre-trial detention have lodged a complaint against their imprisonment with a U.N. panel, hoping to exert pressure on Madrid to free them, lawyers said on Thursday.
The former deputy leader of the Catalan regional government and leaders of two separatist groups are accused of sedition in their bid to declare Catalonia independent from Spain. 
While other figures behind last year's referendum and independence declaration - both acts declared illegal under Spain's constitution - fled to Brussels, Oriol Junqueras, Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart were arrested and denied bail pending their trial.
A judgment from the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, a panel of human rights experts, would not be legally binding, but lawyers said it would be a way of applying pressure on the Spanish state.
""This case does not ask the U.N. to adjudicate on the issue of Catalan independence, but seeks the U.N's reaffirmation that governments cannot repress political dissent through arbitrary detention,"" Ben Emmerson, acting for the three, told a news conference in London. 
The Catalan leaders planned other legal challenges, he said.
Spain fell sharply in a recent annual Democracy Index by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which cited Spain's use of force in an attempt to stop the referendum going ahead and a repressive treatment of secessionist politicians. 
""This kind of political oppression belongs to a bygone era in Spain's history,"" Emmerson said, referring to Spain's dictatorial past under General Francisco Franco.
The independence drive has split loyalties in the wealthy northeastern region and caused resentment in much of the rest of Spain, as well as tarnishing the image of Spain's four-decade-old democracy abroad.
After imposing direct rule on Catalonia in October, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called regional elections in December to try to defuse a crisis that threatened to split the country.
But his gamble backfired when separatist parties won a majority, giving new impetus to the independence movement, led by Carles Puigdemont, who remains a fugitive from justice in Belgium.

Rajoy's office was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.

Cottbus, a city of 100,000 residents in the state of Brandenburg, is home to 3,400 refugees. Tensions there have risen since five Syrian teenagers were detained in January over two knife attacks. 
The six men arrested belonged to the far-right National Democratic Party (NDP), police said. 
""An investigation has been launched against the men aged 17 to 32 years on suspicion of breaching the law on public assembly and their flyers and CS-gas sprays have been confiscated,"" the Cottbus police said in a statement.
The NPD, which Germany's Constitutional Court last year said resembled Adolf Hitler's Nazi party, and other far-right groups have been organizing demonstrations demanding that refugees leave Cottbus.
The police told Reuters it planned to step up security in the city on Saturday, when far right groups plan another protest and refugees have planned a counter demonstration with their supporters, including activists from the far-left Linke party.
Last month, two Syrian teenagers injured a 16-year-old German boy with a knife and a group of three Syrians aged under 17 threatened a German couple with a knife outside a mall in Cottbus. 
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) came first in Cottbus in an election last year, beating Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives amid public concern over Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome more than a million asylum seekers.
Anxiety about immigration is high in Cottbus like in many eastern regions in Germany where older generations grew up under communism, having little contact with foreigners. 
Its technical university draws hundreds of international students each year, and the influx of foreigners and refugees has stopped the population from shrinking below 100,000 from about 145,000 on the eve of German reunification in 1990.
The Constitutional Court last year ruled against banning the NPD, saying it was too weak to endanger democracy.

The FPO, which says it abandoned Nazi ideology espoused by its founders in the 1950s, entered government last month as a junior partner of Sebastian Kurz's conservatives after coming third, with 26 percent of votes, in elections in October.
Its top candidate in regional elections in Lower Austria held last Sunday had been fending off a scandal after a newspaper revealed that a fraternity that he used to help lead had distributed a songbook that joked about killing Jews.
Udo Landbauer, re-elected to the regional assembly, initially rejected President Alexander Van der Bellen's call for him to step down, and his party, many of whose officials are also members of right-wing fraternities, stood by him.
But on Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Freedom Party in Lower Austria confirmed a report by Austrian news agency APA that Landbauer had resigned from all political posts. She declined further comment.
Landbauer has said he did not know of the anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi content of the songbook, since it was published in 1997, well before he joined, and he had only seen copies with those passages redacted or pages torn out.
Prosecutors have opened an investigation into four people, under a law banning Holocaust denial and other Nazi-related offences, but Landbauer is not one of them.
Austria's main Jewish body, the IKG, and Israel have upheld their boycot of FPO officials even after they entered government.

About 40 percent of FPO members of parliament, several FPO ministers and numerous FPO ministry staff are members of right-wing fraternities, according to IKG.

292,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>","Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed back at work after detention, company says","RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is back on the job as chairman of global investment firm Kingdom Holding after being released from detention in an anti-corruption campaign, the company said on Thursday.
Prince Alwaleed, one of the country's top international investors, was freed on Saturday, nearly three months after being taken into custody along with dozens of senior officials and businessmen on the orders of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
Most detainees have been released, after settlements secured just over $100 billion from members of the elite, the attorney general has said, without providing details.
In his first interview since being detained, conducted hours before his release, Prince Alwaleed told Reuters he maintained his innocence and expected to keep full control of his firm.
A senior Saudi official would not confirm that claim but said any settlements included an admission of guilt.
In the absence of more information, speculation has run rampant about whether Prince Alwaleed secured his freedom by handing over part of his fortune - previously estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion - or stood up to the authorities and won.
He and other tycoons face a challenge to get back into the swing of running their financial empires in the uncertainty hanging over the business community since their detention.
Their ability to do so could make it harder for Saudi Arabia to attract foreign investors to big projects, an important part of Crown Prince Mohammed's grand vision to transform the kingdom and reduce its dependence on oil.
Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of King Salman, holds stakes in major international companies including  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Twitter, and ride-hailing firm Lyft.
In the first few days after his detention, Kingdom Holding's share price plunged 23 percent, erasing $2.2 billion of his personal fortune on paper.
After a jump this week, the stock has regained almost all that it lost, but during his detention the overall stock market rose 10 percent. Kingdom shares do not reflect that gain, suggesting investors are still discounting the stock.
Kingdom published a photo of Prince Alwaleed reviewing documents behind a large wooden desk and still sporting the grey beard he grew in detention.
""We are very pleased to welcome back (His Royal Highness) Prince Alwaleed to continue his important work as Chairman of Kingdom Holding Company,"" Chief Executive Talal Almaimansaid said.
The firm's strategy is aligned with the Vision 2030 reform agenda ""to create strong investor appeal and a business environment in which KHC and our partners can flourish"", he added.

The protest, in which dozens of people burnt flags and chanted, ""Death to Pakistan"", was not large, but it came during a period of heightened tension in the Afghan capital following two major attacks in the past two weeks.
On Thursday, Interior Minister Wais Barmak and Masooom Stanekzai, head of the NDS intelligence service, returned from a visit to Islamabad, where they had pressed Pakistani authorities to move against Taliban leaders based in the country.
""We provided Pakistan with documents about Taliban operating centres inside Pakistan and we expect Pakistan to act against them,"" Barmak told a news conference in Kabul.
He declined to provide details on the information provided, citing the need to keep operational intelligence secret while investigations continued.
The officials said Pakistan had agreed to take ""practical steps"" to act on the information but that was immediately disputed by Pakistani authorities, who said only that the information was ""being examined for its authenticity"".
""Pakistan has not given any commitment to give reply to the information received from the NDS Chief Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, during his trip to Islamabad, yesterday,"" the Pakistan Embassy said in a statement. 
A Pakistani security delegation is due to visit Kabul on Saturday but the embassy denied that the visit was a followup to the Afghan officials' visit to Islamabad. It said the visit was part of the Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Solidarity, a bilateral program running since November.
The visits come as the United States has cut off some aid to Pakistan over what it calls its failure to crack down on militants attacking in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan has long accused Pakistan of providing safe haven to Taliban and other insurgents, a charge Pakistan denies, pointing to the thousands of casualties it has suffered from militant violence over the years.
Last month, the Taliban claimed two major attacks in Kabul, one on the Intercontinental Hotel, which killed more than 30 people and a second that killed more than 100 people when an ambulance packed with explosives blew up on a crowded street.
The attacks in the heavily protected city center fueled fresh worries about the Western-backed government's ability to provide security and combat the Taliban insurgency.
On Thursday, the defense ministry issued a statement that dismissed as ""exaggerated"" a BBC report that the Taliban were operating in 70 percent of Afghanistan and said the army was involved in 14 separate operations.
But despite a sharp rise in U.S. air strikes that commanders say have put heavy pressure on the Taliban and driven them back from major provincial centres, their ability to strike urban targets and undermine confidence in the government appears unaffected.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May has warned that European Union citizens arriving in Britain after Brexit next year may lose some rights, setting up a clash with the EU over their treatment during any transition period.
Curbing immigration was a key reason Britons voted to leave the EU in 2016, following a large influx of EU citizens, especially from poorer countries in eastern Europe.
The European Union has offered Britain a status quo transition until the end of 2020 after Brexit. The bloc wants its three million citizens in Britain to remain eligible for all the same rights until the end of that period.
But May has suggested EU citizens coming to Britain after March next year will be treated differently. 
""People who had come to the UK when we were a member of the EU had set up certain expectations,"" she told reporters on her way to a Chinese trade visit.
""I'm clear there's a difference between those people who came prior to us leaving and those who will come when they know the UK is no longer a member of the EU.""
A spokesman later said EU citizens would get the same rights during a transition phase, when Britain would set up a new registration scheme. But there must be a change after that period ends for those who arrived during the transition, he added.
The issue is one obstacle Britain and the EU will need to resolve to reach a transitional deal, which will give the two sides time to prepare for the far-reaching impact of the end of 46 years of union.
Philippe Lamberts, a European lawmaker who deals with Brexit, told Reuters on Thursday: ""Citizens' rights will be a negotiation point and we want to stand firm on this - that new provisions only enter into force after the end of the transition period.""
Many Brexit backers are voicing concern that the referendum result may be ""betrayed"" by the plan to change little of the current relationship immediately after Britain formally leaves on March 29, 2019. But May dismissed some of those concerns. 

British people ""did not vote for nothing to change when we come out of the EU"", she said. ""What we're doing now is doing the job that the British people asked the government to do, which is to deliver on Brexit.""

298,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Argentina's Macri downgrades labor reforms after union pressure,"By Nicolás Misculin
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's government is scaling back and delaying a planned labor reform after pressure from union leaders and a violent protest over changes to pension laws late last year.
Measures will be split into two or three bills to be sent to Congress from March, once the government has negotiated with opposition Peronists and with powerful union leaders, two government officials said. 
President Mauricio Macri had promised more immediate and drastic changes to the country's labor laws, widely seen as among the most costly to companies in Latin America, after his business-friendly coalition performed unexpectedly well in October's mid-term elections.
But he still does not have a congressional majority and has responded carefully to recent hostility from unions. The government now seeks a piecemeal approach to labor reform, one of the main factors that has held back investment in Latin America's No. 3 economy.
""There are some unions that are working and that have understood we have to gain productivity and competitiveness,"" Macri told Reuters in an interview last week in Davos, Swtizerland, citing workers in a key shale producing province as an example. 
""And there are others that don't understand that there's been a change and that the citizens demand from them cooperation.""
Unions had broadly backed some of Macri's measures since he took office in late 2015, but the relationship has deteriorated in recent months. 
Macri's government has threatened to cut funding for some unions and audited some of their finances. The judiciary has charged and even jailed some important union leaders on corruption accusations.
Unions on the other hand have accused Macri, a scion of one of Argentina's wealthiest families, of persecuting workers in a country where support for labor rights is historically strong. 
In a public letter to Macri this week, Hugo Moyano, head of Argentina's largest umbrella union the CGT, issued a searing critique of the government and a new pension reform, which spurred violent protests before it passed Congress in December.
The government has ""gravely injured millions of retirees... who have worked with dignity their whole lives and do not have the possibility of enjoying a comfortable retirement like your father,"" Moyano wrote.
Macri's father Franco ran a large conglomerate that once oversaw the country's postal service. 
LOOK FOR CONSENSUS
The violence around the passage of a law changing how retirement benefits are calculated in December has given the government pause. 
""Now the idea is to not be so confrontational. We need to look for consensus,"" said a government official who was not authorized to be named. He said the CGT and moderate Peronists, like Senator Miguel Angel Pichetto, would need to be on board with future reforms.
The government will progress with measures that have broad support, like bringing informal workers into the legal labor force, the official said. On the other hand, a proposal to lower corporate penalties for firing workers faces steep opposition.
""There is a strong consensus on themes like labor amnesty, a medical technology agency, a vocational training institute,"" said a second government official. He said such measures would be passed by Congress and not by decree. 
Still, the unions have shown no sign of lessening their opposition. Some have already called protests for February and March.

""We reject the labor reform. It is only about accumulating more profits for concentrated economic groups without contemplating anything for the workers,"" the leader of the CTA union Pablo Micheli said.

Supporters of Berri and his Amal Movement have been protesting since Monday, after Aoun's son-in-law, Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, was caught on camera calling Berri ""a thug"".
The standoff has exacerbated a political standoff between Berri, a Shi'ite, and Aoun, a Maronite Christian, threatening to ignite sectarian tensions before a parliamentary election in May and to paralyze government.
The tensions continued on Wednesday evening, when the army deployed in a Christian area near Beirut after Amal supporters drove through it firing guns into the air, according to security sources and local reports.
Supporters of the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), which was founded by Aoun, came out into the streets, also carrying weapons, according to the sources and reports.
""We ask all those who took to the streets in an unorganized and spontaneous manner ... To halt any movements in the street,"" Amal said in a statement.
Amal thanked its supporters for condemning Bassil's remark but said this had led to ""some problems which do not reflect the image and position of the Amal Movement"".

The FPM said on Tuesday that Bassil had already expressed regret for the comments and that it regarded the issue as over. Berri said on Wednesday he must apologize ""to the Lebanese people"" for the remark.

This is an edited translation of his story:
""I lived as a child beggar in North Korea. I was stealing coal from a train when I fell off and lost my leg and my hand.
I had to bring the crutches with me. If I didn't have them, I wouldn't have made it here. The state doesn't help you in North Korea, and people who need crutches make their own. Mine are therefore not factory-made so they're not perfect and break easily. 
I had several pairs of crutches but they all broke, and this was the last pair. I used these crutches for 10 years, until I was 25, when I arrived in South Korea. 
I would steal coals from moving trains and fall off, destroying my crutches. Or I would get beaten up by the police and they'd take and then break my crutches. When they broke, I would make new ones. When I had new ones, I could go back outside. 
When I first arrived in South Korea I thought about throwing them out. 
South Korea's intelligence agency gave me a prosthetic leg. My friends said I should throw the crutches out and not think about North Korea. They said I should show Kim Jong Il I was living a new life in South Korea and throw out everything I had from the North. Some asked if I got upset when I saw my crutches. 
But I couldn't just throw them out. To make my crutches, my friends had given me some wood that they had bought, and someone I knew in North Korea who had carpentry skills had made them. It was my father who added the final touches.
There is a lot of love from my North Korean friends and family in these crutches. So I didn't throw them out. The South Korean government gave me some new crutches because the wood from my North Korean ones is hard and painful. But I still keep them, so as not to forget those memories.""

""In that case, it will be for the UK to find agreement with the country,"" the diplomat told Reuters after the bloc's executive European Commission briefed the remaining 27 EU states on the issue.
Diplomats said the general expectation is that third countries would not want to make problems for Britain as the international agreements were mutually beneficial, but the possibility was there.
""In general, that's more of a UK problem than ours,"" a second diplomat said.
The EU's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said earlier this week that Britain would remain bound by all existing EU international agreements such as trade and aviation pacts.
""But we cannot ensure ... that the UK keeps the benefits from these international agreements. Our partners around the world may have their own views on this,"" Barnier told a news conference on Monday.
Britain will be leaving more than 750 international agreements after Brexit.
One issue raised during Wednesday's briefing was tariff-rate quotas that allow the import of farm products, such as beef and lamb, from fellow World Trade Organization members.
Britain and the European Commission told other WTO members in October how they plan to split the quotas, but this requires unanimous approval from the 164-member WTO.

Agricultural exporters to the EU have said they would not accept the plan simply to split the quotas based on past trade flows, arguing it would reduce their flexibility.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court on Thursday overturned its decision to release the chairman of the local arm of Amnesty International, the rights group said, a stark reversal in a case that has sparked international outrage.
An Istanbul penal court on Wednesday ordered the conditional release of Taner Kilic, who has been in prison since June on terrorism charges. Prosecutors say he downloaded ByLock, a messaging app allegedly used by followers of the Muslim cleric Turkey blames for a 2016 coup attempt.
Kilic, whose case attracted global attention and is seen by some as representative of a broad crackdown under President Tayyip Erdogan, was due to be released while the trial against him and 10 other human rights activists on terrorism-related charges continues.
But the Istanbul court on Thursday reversed its decision following an appeal by a prosecutor, Amnesty said.
""To have been granted release only to have the door to freedom so callously slammed in his face is devastating for Taner, his family and all who stand for justice in Turkey,"" Amnesty Secretary General Salil Shetty said in a statement.
""This is the latest example of the crisis in Turkey's justice system that is ruining lives and hollowing out the right to a fair trial,"" Shetty said, adding that Kilic's wife and daughters had waited all day by the prison gates to greet him.
The case against the 11 activists, who face up to 15 years in prison, has become a flashpoint in Turkey's tense relations with Europe and heightened concern that an important NATO member is sliding further toward authoritarianism.
Kilic and the 10 others deny the charges against them. The prosecutor has alleged a range of charges, including helping the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen.
Since the failed 2016 coup, which the government has blamed on Gulen, authorities have jailed more than 50,000 people and sacked or suspended more than 150,000. The government says such measures are necessary given the multiple security threats it faces.

306,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",Hungary says could quit U.N. talks on migration pact,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary could quit talks on a United Nations pact on migration because its pro-migration tone threatened Hungary's security interests, the foreign minister said on Thursday.
Hungary's right-wing nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who seeks reelection for a third consecutive term in elections on April 8, has been one of the strongest opponents to the European Union's migration policy since his government fenced off the country's southern borders in 2015 to keep out migrants.
Orban has stepped up the anti-migrant campaign since last year, accusing U.S. financier George Soros of stoking illegal migration. Soros has strongly rejected an extended nationwide campaign against him as ""distortions and lies"" meant to create a false external enemy.
The government says illegal immigration threatens to undermine European stability and its harsh anti-migrant rhetoric has gone down well with voters. 
Some analysts said the threat to quit the U.N. migration pact talks was part of Orban's domestic political campaign aimed at mobilizing voters. His ruling Fidesz party has a firm lead over the opposition in opinion polls.
""The U.N. wants to create a pact that encourages migration, we are of the opposite view, and if the first draft (of this pact) in February takes this line ... the question is why we would have to take part in this debate?"", Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told M1 state television.
Szijjarto said migration posed a global challenge that was dangerous and must be stopped. 
In December, the United States quit negotiations on the migration pact because, according to the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, a global approach to the issue was ""simply not compatible with U.S. sovereignty."" 
With a record 21.3 million refugees globally, the 193-member U.N. General Assembly adopted a political declaration in 2016, known as the New York Declaration, in which they agreed to spend two years negotiating the pact on safe, orderly and regular migration.
Formal negotiations are expected to start in February over the non-binding pact.
Peter Kreko, director of think tank Political Capital said the anti-UN comments were part of Orban's domestic campaign, and fit into the narrative of his battles with Brussels over migration.
""It fits into the fight for sovereignty,"" Kreko said.

According to a poll released on Thursday by institute Median, Fidesz' election support dropped to 37 percent from 39 percent, while the strongest opposition party Jobbik gained 2 percentage points to 13 percent. Among decided voters, Fidesz had 53 percent support, down from 60 percent, while Jobbik had 18 percent.

French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday warned Turkey that the operation in the northern Afrin region should not become an excuse to invade Syria and that he wanted Ankara to coordinate its action with its allies.
Turkey launched the air and ground offensive, dubbed ""Operation Olive Branch"", nearly two weeks ago to target the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in Afrin. But the incursion has put pressure on relations with the West, particularly the United States, which has backed the Kurdish fighters and has its own troops on the ground supporting them in other parts of Syria.
""We consider a country like France giving us reminders about an operation we are carrying out in accordance with international laws to be insults,"" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters in Ankara.
""We are using our right to self defense, this is in line with UN Security Council decisions and not an invasion. They shouldn't be two-faced,"" he said.
France, like the United States, has extended arms and training to a YPG-led militia in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. That has infuriated Turkey, which considers the YPG terrorists and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). 
The PKK, considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast.
Cavusoglu said Syrian peace talks in Geneva needed to be revived, adding that the Syrian government needed to start negotiating in order to do so, after a Russian-sponsored conference on reaching peace in Syria was held this week in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi.

The talks, which Russia has called a Syrian Congress on National Dialogue, ended on Tuesday with a statement calling for democratic elections, but ignoring key opposition demands after a day marred by squabbles and heckling of the Russian foreign minister.

At a vote on Wednesday, lawmakers voted in favor of a ""full decant"" of the building, home to the ""Big Ben"" clock tower, perhaps London's best-known landmark, to try to fix a multitude of problems that some politicians said had made the palace a potential ""death trap"".
The planned move, part of a proposed 5.6 billion pound ($8 billion) modernization, will not take effect until 2025 at the earliest.
""There are difficult decisions to make on how we best protect one of the world's most iconic buildings for future generations, but we must address these decisions head on,"" Andrea Leadsom, leader of the House of Commons, told lawmakers, many of whom were reluctant to leave the building.
""The Palace of Westminster is the seat of our democracy, an iconic world famous building and it is in dire need of repair,"" she said, adding there were ""critical risks"" at the palace, where over the last 10 years 60 incidents could have ended in fire.
Westminster has been at the heart of British politics for some 900 years and lawmakers have gathered on the same site since 1547. The Palace of Westminster was almost completely destroyed by a fire in 1834 and it was rebuilt in 1852. The Big Ben bell was installed in the clock tower seven years later.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's government has extended the stay of Afghan refugees in the country for 60 days, a shorter-than-recommended time that revives fears Islamabad is preparing a forced return of hundreds of thousands to violence-plagued Afghanistan.
About 2.5 million Afghans live in Pakistan, home to the world's second-largest refugee population.
For years, the refugees, some of whom have been living in Pakistan since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, received longer-term extensions of up to a year of the Proof of Registration cards that give them legal status.
But recent tense relations between the neighbors has prompted concern that Pakistan might retaliate by pushing back Afghan refugees, particularly since official permission to stay was only extended for 30 days at the beginning of this year.
On Wednesday, Pakistan's Ministry of States and Frontier Regions, which deals with the refugees, recommended a five-month extension in permission to stay.
But late that evening, the cabinet disregarded the recommendation and ordered a shorter extension.
""The cabinet approved a grant of 60 days' extension in the Proof of Registration Cards for Afghan refugees,"" the prime minister's office said in a statement late on Wednesday.
The U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) in Afghanistan declined immediate comment on the Pakistani decision, saying it had yet to get all the details, but stressed the importance of refugees returning in a ""voluntary, gradual and in a dignified way"".
In 2016, nearly 400,000 refugees returned during a campaign by Pakistan to press them to go home. Last year, about 60,000 came back.
'PRESSURE'
Any big influx back to Afghanistan would test the ability of the government and international agencies to cope, said the UNHCR representative in Afghanistan, Fathiaa Abdalla.
""It will put pressure on the services, on the humanitarian support and it would become more or less an emergency and that wouldn't be good for the country and wouldn't be good for the people themselves,"" Abdalla said.
""Therefore the importance of a gradual and voluntary return.""
Afghanistan is already struggling with large numbers of internally displaced people.
In 2017, fighting forced 360,000 people from their homes, the United Nations said, while more than 17,000 people were displaced over the past week, the U.N. Organisation for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Assistance said. 
Afghanistan was not safe enough for large numbers of people to return, the aid group Oxfam said this week.
""To claim the opposite is to ignore the reality and puts lives at risk,"" it said.
Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have deteriorated in recent years and tension heightened after two particularly bloody Taliban attacks in Kabul that Afghans and the United States blamed on militants based in Pakistan.
Washington and Kabul say Taliban and other militants plot carnage in safe havens on the Pakistani side of the border and have repeatedly urged Pakistan to do more to rein them in.
Pakistan complains the large number of refugees are a burden, and recently said Islamist militants could hide among them.

Pakistan said last month a suspected U.S. drone strike in a district along the Afghan border hit an Afghan refugee camp, a statement the United States said was ""false"".

ANKARA (Reuters) - The top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Thursday the country's leadership had no intention of reining in its influence across the Middle East despite U.S. pressure to do so, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who sees Iran as a rising threat to regional stability in the Middle East, has pledged to work with Gulf Arab states and Israel to curb what they say are Tehran’s attempts to extend its influence in the region. 
""Iran's influence in the region is inevitable and to remain a key player in the region, this influence will continue,"" the adviser, Ali Akbar Velayati, was quoted by Fars as saying. 
Iran backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his country’s civil war, Shi'ite militias in Iraq, Houthi rebels in Yemen and Lebanon’s Hezbollah.
""Iran has no intention to abandon the oppressed nations in the region ... Our presence in Syria, Iraq, Palestine and Lebanon is in coordination with the governments of these countries,"" Velayati said. 
""Iran is the heart of international developments ... America wants to tear down the Middle East ... Iran opposes it.""
He also criticized slogans such as ""Let go of Palestine,"" and ""Leave Syria, think about us"", which were chanted by tens of thousands of Iranians protesting against Iran's unelected clerical elite and Iranian foreign policy in the Middle East. 
""Don't worry about what was instigated by our foreign enemies ... Chants like 'Not Gaza, not Lebanon' shows their lack of understanding of international affairs... You cannot remain indifferent when your neighbor's house is on fire,"" he said. 
Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Iran's biggest unrest for nearly a decade which spread to around 80 towns and cities across Iran in early January. 
Iranian authorities said 25 people died and over 3,000 people were arrested during the unrest, which lasted for more than a week and then subsided. Most of those arrested have been released but around 300 remain in jail facing charges, Iran’s interior minister said last week. 

Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards put down the protests, which were initially sparked by soaring food prices and high unemployement but then turned political when protesters in several cities called on the clerical rulers to step down.

Maria Ressa, chief executive of Rappler (www.rappler.com), responding to a complaint last year by businessman Wilfredo Keng, also called the allegations ""baffling"" and ""unfounded"". 
Keng featured in a 2012 Rappler story, updated in 2014, that cited an intelligence report linking him to illegal activities such as human trafficking and drug smuggling.
""The threat of being sued for libel is a constant one for us fearless journalists,"" Ressa said in a written reply to the libel complaint filed with National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). Her lawyer provided a copy to the media. 
""This notwithstanding, it is our sacred duty to report events the public has the right to know.""
Keng, president of a mining firm, said the Rappler story included ""malicious imputations of crimes, vices and defects, which tarnish my good and clean reputation with the public.""
Rappler posted a copy of Keng's complaint in a January article. 
Ressa argued the statute of limitations on libel, which should also apply to cyber libel, had already expired so the NBI had no basis to investigate and charge her. 
The Rappler story, she added, was published before the country's cyber crime law took effect, so, ""There was yet no crime of cyber libel to be committed."" 
Reuters could not immediately reach Keng's lawyer to seek comment. 

Rappler has invoked freedom of the press in its appeal to the Court of Appeals in the Philippines, challenging a decision of the Securities and Exchange Commission to revoke its license for violations of foreign equity curbs on domestic media.

313,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Azeri incumbent Aliyev to run for fourth term in October presidential election,"BAKU (Reuters) - Azeri President Ilham Aliyev, in office since succeeding his father in 2003, has been nominated as the ruling party's candidate in the presidential election in October, the party executive secretary said on Thursday.
So far there are no other candidates. If he wins, Aliyev, 56, would enter his fourth term in office.
Azerbaijan's huge energy reserves and strategic location give it a prominent place in Europe's hopes of reducing its energy dependence on Russia. Critics say this has diluted Western criticism of Aliyev's style of rule.
Human rights groups say his rule is authoritarian and that his government is pursuing a sustained crackdown on dissent. He denies these accusations. 
Aliyev took over from his father, Heydar, who ruled Azerbaijan initially as a Communist Party leader in the Soviet Union and then as president following independence.
Aliyev cemented his position in power with two referendums, one in 2009 which scrapped a two-term presidential limit, and another in 2016, in which he extended the head of state's term of office to seven years from five, steps his critics saw as illegal and undemocratic.
""I hope that our youth, those, who are members of (ruling) Yeni Azerbaijan Party, will do their best for victory of the party's candidate Ilham Aliyev in this important political event,"" Ali Akhmedov, the ruling party's executive secretary and the country's deputy prime minister, told reporters.
The election is set for Oct. 17.
Aliyev has tried to strike a balance between Moscow and the West, notably on energy policy. His rule benefited from an economic boom fueled by oil exports, but a slump in global oil prices in the last three years has weakened the Azeri manat currency and contracted the economy.
In its World Report 2018, Human Rights Watch said the authorities in Azerbaijan had over the past year waged a ""sustained a concerted assault on government critics, threatening the survival of independent activism in the country"".

At least 25 journalists and political and youth activists were sentenced to long prison terms in politically motivated, unfair trials in 2017, the report said.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has overseen a sweeping crackdown on human rights activism in China that has seen hundreds of rights lawyers and activists detained, dozens arrested and some handed lengthy prison sentences. 
Yu, an outspoken critic of the government clampdown who had worked to defend fellow lawyers who were arrested in the sweep, was disbarred on Jan. 15, days before he was detained by authorities outside his home in Beijing. 
Initially charged with ""obstructing a public service"", Yu is now being investigated for ""inciting subversion of state power"", Yu's wife, Xu Yan, said this week, adding that the police had also summonsed her in relation to her husband's charges.
German commissioner for human rights Barbel Kofler said in a statement posted online that the latest developments in Yu's case were ""unsettling"" and had increased his concerns about the rights situation in China.
""All Yu Wensheng has done is campaign for democratic reforms in China and support fellow citizens who were harassed for exercising their human rights,"" he said.
Yu should be released without delay and granted the civil rights guaranteed in the Chinese constitution, he added.
Asked about Kofler's statement, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing that China had rule of law and that those who broke the law had to “accept legal responsibility”. 
“We resolutely oppose any foreign government or individual trying to interfere in China’s internal affairs. I think this German official has no qualifications or right to demand China release anyone,” she said.
The day before his detention, Yu released a strongly worded open letter in which he called for the deletion of a preamble of China's state constitution, a section that grants the Chinese Communist Party primacy in leadership.
The letter was the latest in a series of statements Yu had made critical of the party and its leadership, including calling for Xi to be replaced as party leader.
Yu's case, alongside the surprise disbarring of a second prominent rights lawyer, Sui Muqing, shortly after, have sparked outcry from China's rights activists and their supporters both inside China and overseas.
Petitions calling for reversals of the authorities decisions for both lawyers have been circulated in instant messenger chat groups and online, each garnering hundreds of signatures.

A National Audit Office report published on Wednesday found there was a shortfall of at least 4.9 billion pounds ($7 billion), potentially rising by another 15.9 billion pounds, if all the risks identified by the Ministry of Defence arise and it is unable to make the savings assumed under the plan.
The report, which could affect government spending decisions and private contractors such as Serco and Babcock, said some of the costing expectations had been over-optimistic and that foreign exchange rates used had not been accurate.
Earlier this month the head of Britain's armed forces expressed concerns that defense spending is being too tightly squeezed because of wider public spending cuts.
Government spending plans issued in late 2015 foresaw defense spending expected to rise slightly above inflation over a five-year period.
The National Audit Office review found that the department had understated forecast costs related to the purchase of five Type 31e frigates not included in the plan, while the cost of nuclear-related projects continues to grow.

The IG Metall union has called for full-day walkouts through Friday, firing a last warning shot before it ballots for extended industrial action that could be crippling to companies reliant on a supply chain of car parts and other components.
Emboldened by the fastest economic growth in six years and record low unemployment, IG Metall is demanding an 8 percent pay rise over 27 months for 3.9 million metal and engineering workers across Europe's largest economy.
The union has also asked for workers to be given the right to reduce their weekly hours to 28 from 35 to care for children, elderly or sick relatives, and to be able to return to full time after two years.
This is IG Metall's first major push for a change in hours since workers staged seven weeks of strikes in 1984 to help secure a cut of the working week to 35 from 40 hours.
Employers have offered a 6.8 percent wage increase, but rejected the demand for shorter hours unless they can also increase workers' hours when necessary.
They have also dismissed the idea that they should make up some of the pay shortfall for workers who cut their hours, saying that would mean some being paid a higher hourly wage than others.
Around 68,000 workers at 80 companies including truckmaker MAN and automotive supplier ZF Friedrichshafen [ZFF.UL] downed their tools on Wednesday, IG Metall said.
By Friday, that number is expected to rise to around 260 companies, including Mercedes-Benz maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Porsche (DE:VOWG_p).
The DIW economic institute has estimated the strikes could cost companies a total of 62 million euros ($77 million) a day in lost revenue, assuming around 50,000 workers, or on average 200 per company, stop working for one day each.
Both the union and employers have left the door open to resuming talks after the planned strikes end on Friday, but each is demanding more willingness from the other to make concessions.
""There can only be an agreement if the employers improve their stance on all three topics: pay, the right to shorter hours and aid for workers burdened by their situation at home or at work,"" IG Metall chief Joerg Hofmann said.
The employers are also challenging the strikes in court and seeking damages.
Workers at Volkswagen's headquarters in Wolfsburg and at other sites in western Germany are staging separate strikes on Thursday after IG Metall rejected an improved pay offer for about 120,000 staff at the carmaker.

Police began simultaneous raids in 43 provinces to capture the suspects, 58 of whom were believed to be users of the outlawed ByLock messaging app, Anadolu said.
Turkey banned ByLock following the attempted putsch, saying followers of the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen used it communicate on the night of the coup, when rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and warplanes to attack parliament, killing more than 240 people.
Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has denied involvement and condemned the coup.
More than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over alleged links to Gulen, while 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the military, public and private sectors.
The government dismisses rights groups' concerns about the crackdown, saying only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by Gulen's network, which it says infiltrated institutions such as the judiciary, army and schools.

Their station, NTV, was one of three independently owned stations shut down by Kenyan authorities on Tuesday after they broadcast live coverage of an opposition ceremony symbolically ""swearing in"" opposition leader Raila Odinga.
""We were doing our job, we had the right to do this, and if I was to do it again, I'd do it the same way,"" NTV senior anchor and reporter Ken Mijungu told Reuters after an anxious night spent conferring with lawyers and wondering if police would appear with arrest warrants. 
He said his colleagues, Larry Madowo and Linus Kaikai, had all been independently warned by security sources on Wednesday that their arrest was imminent. 
In the early evening, when men they believed were plainclothes police appeared outside their office building, they were advised by the station's management to stay inside.
By morning, the men were still in their newsroom. 
""Our head of security said he has reason to believe they have gone for reinforcements,"" said Madowo, 30, who was producing coverage on Tuesday before authorities took NTV off air.
In African states with entrenched rulers such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon, governments have asked telecommunications companies to block social media, mainly during elections and protests.
But the shutdown of TV stations in Kenya came as a shock to journalists used to operating freely. 
""This is clearly a slide to dictatorship. It's a return to a repressive period we had forgotten about,"" said Madowo. ""We are becoming another African country with these kinds of issues.""
Kaikai, who is also chairman of the Kenya Editors' Guild, said editors had been warned by authorities that they could be shut down if they covered the event.
The stations would stay off air indefinitely, the government said on Wednesday, as it investigates the symbolic oath by Odinga, directly challenging President Uhuru Kenyatta. [L8N1PQ3JZ]
Interior Minister Fred Matiang'i accused media organizations of facilitating the ""illegal act"", which he said put the lives of thousands of Kenyans at risk. 
""This is a gross abuse of the law and complete disregard for the constitution,"" said Mijungu.
Also on Wednesday, police arrested Tom Kajwang, an opposition lawmaker who administered Odinga's ""oath"". He was expected to be charged on Thursday with administering an unlawful oath, a security source told Reuters.

May, the leader of a fragile minority government, is under intense pressure from rival factions within her Conservative Party over her approach to Brexit and perceived weaknesses in her broader leadership of the country. 
The speculation has reached fever pitch in recent days, with the number of lawmakers formally calling for her to go reportedly nearing the threshold to trigger a leadership contest. The official number is not disclosed by the party.
But Fox, speaking during a trade visit to China with May, called on party colleagues to stop obsessing about domestic politics and take note of how she is viewed by leaders overseas. 
""They look at the Prime Minister in a different way than some of, let's say, the internal tea room discussions in the UK do,"" he told the BBC, referring to the private tea rooms in parliament historically used by lawmakers to plot and gossip. 
""I do wish more of my party colleagues have seen the sort of leadership and commitment and positive agenda that’s been projected for Britain here in China,"" Fox said in a separate interview with ITN.
The endorsement from Fox - seen as a loyal member of cabinet, but one who is strongly aligned with so-called ""Brexiteers"" - comes after May announced steps towards closer trade cooperation with China.
However, questions on her future have overshadowed the trip, prompting May to declare ""I'm not a quitter"" - the second time during her 18 months in power she has deployed the phrase to try and play down speculation she could quit or be toppled. 

""I will give full support to the prime minister as long as she wants to lead my party,"" Fox told ITN.

Kem Sokha, head of the now dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), was arrested on Sept. 3 amid a crackdown on critics of authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen.
Rights groups have criticized the crackdown as Cambodia prepares to hold two elections this year. The CNRP's dissolution and the jailing of Kem Sokha have removed the biggest challenge Hun Sen may have faced at the polls, the groups say.
A Senate election is set for Feb 25, and a general election is due in July. 
""The court decided to uphold the lower court's decision not to release Kem Sokha on bail,"" Touch Tharith, a spokesman for the Appeal Court, told Reuters. 
He declined to say why the application was rejected.
Lawyers for Kem Sokha, who sought bail on the grounds that he suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes, said judges cited security concerns as a reason for the rejection.
""I am disappointed that the court didn't consider these illnesses ... and continued to detain him,"" Chuong Chu Ngy, a lawyer for Kem Sokha, told reporters.
Lawyers for Kem Sokha said he appeared in court on Thursday.
No date has been set for the trial.
Dozens of Kem Sokha's supporters gathered outside the court and his 92-year-old mother was seen weeping.
Observers from the Australian, Swedish and United States embassies and the U.N. human rights office were denied access to the hearing. 
The CNRP was dissolved by Cambodia's Supreme Court in November at the request of the government. 
Hun Sen has accused Kem Sokha of getting help from the United States to overthrow the government. The U.S. embassy has rejected any suggestion of interference in politics.
In a speech on Thursday Hun Sen said nobody could topple him.

""Nobody can topple Hun Sen, except Hun Sen,"" he said, adding that any group that tried to remove him from power would be met with deadly force.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Singapore court rejected on Thursday a prosecution appeal to reinstate a longer jail sentence for the co-founder of a popular church who was convicted of misusing millions of dollars to support his wife's pop-singing career.
The ruling ended nearly five years of legal battles by Kong Hee, who co-founded the City Harvest Church, which gripped a city-state where there is little tolerance for corruption and where such cases of fraud mixed with faith have been rare.
Kong, 53, was originally sentenced to eight years in jail in October 2015 for criminal breach of trust and falsification of accounts. The High Court reduced that sentence last April to three-and-a-half years.
The prosecution appealed against that decision, asking for the original sentence to be reinstated, but the Court of Appeal ruled on Thursday that the High Court's decision would remain. 
The Court of Appeal also rejected appeals by prosecutors against the sentencing of four other church leaders, who will continue to serve reduced sentences. 
Kong was found guilty of misusing S$50 million ($36 million) of church money to fund his wife's musical career. Domestic media have reported it was the largest amount of charity funds ever misappropriated in Singapore.
The once-glamorous founding pastor of City Harvest, known for his electrifying Sunday services, wore purple prison garb for the court appearance, his hair noticeably grayed.
Kong smiled and acknowledged with a wave more than 50 of his supporters, some of whom had waited outside the court from 6 a.m. (2200 GMT Wednesday). 
City Harvest Church preaches a ""prosperity gospel"" that blends spiritual and material aspirations.
Kong's wife, Ho Yeow Sun - known as Sun Ho - is famous for a video of her English-language hit ""China Wine"", which shows her dancing intimately with rapper Wyclef Jean.
Defense lawyers had said Sun Ho's music career was used to evangelize. She was not charged in the case.
While megachurches originated in the United States, some of the largest are in Asia, where packaging the traditional biblical message into a more dynamic format of pop music, lively services and social media has lured a new generation of followers and turned the churches into major enterprises.

City Harvest had a congregation of 15,923 and more than 50 affiliations in China, the United States, and seven other countries in 2016, according to its latest annual report.

A police report seen by Reuters said Rafael Baylosis and a companion tried to flee from army and police intelligence agents who were following them but were cornered on Wednesday afternoon in the center of the capital, Manila.
The arrests of Baylosis, 69, and Roque Guillermo was a product of intelligence and surveillance operations after a tip-off from residents in Quezon City, northeast of Manila, national police spokesman John Bulalacao said. 
""Baylosis is believed to be the acting secretary of the New People's Army,"" Bulalacao said, referring to the 3,000-strong guerrilla force that has waged a war in rural areas for nearly 50 years.
The conflict has killed more than 40,000 people and stunted growth in poor but resource-rich regions of the Philippines where mines and plantations are located.
Baylosis was the first ranking rebel leader to be captured since the Philippines ended a peace process with communist rebels late last year.
Human rights advocates and leftist activists are expected to protest in front of the national police headquarters on Thursday to condemn the arrests and demand Baylosis' release because they say he was covered by a state-issued immunity pass.
""The trumped-up charges must stop,"" Renato Reyes, secretary-general of activist group Bayan (Nation), said in a statement. ""Rather than persecute peace consultants, Duterte should resume peace talks on the most important substantive agenda."" 
The rebels' political arm, the National Democratic Front, described the arrests as ""illegal"" and a ""flagrant violation"" of safety guarantees because Baylosis was a peace talks consultant.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the safety and immunity guarantees were no longer in effect after Duterte scrapped the peace talks, telling human rights activists to challenge the arrest order in court.
""The authorities are just doing their job. He has a warrant of arrest and our authorities may face dereliction of duties charges if they will not arrest him,"" Roque told a news briefing. 
Baylosis was among 18 rebel leaders freed on bail in August 2016 and allowed to travel to The Netherlands to take part in peace negotiations. He is facing murder charges after the army discovered the mass grave of 15 suspected government spies in 2006 who were killed in the central Philippines.
Duterte ended intermittent peace talks with Maoist-led rebels in November and declared them ""terrorists"" because hostilities had continued during the negotiations, ordering security forces to go after guerrilla leaders.

The spat has become increasingly bitter, with both sides trading accusations after two Chinese airlines canceled extra flights to Taiwan over the Lunar New Year, the most important holiday in the Chinese calendar, potentially leaving thousands of Taiwanese without tickets to go home.
""The people's eyes are sharp. Whether this disputed issue can be resolved is an important indicator of how Taiwan people will view the future direction of relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,"" Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement late Wednesday.
""We again call on the Chinese side to treasure the hard won peace and stability of relations between the two sides. China needs to carry out measures to make up for this deficiency, in order to avoid this issue continuing to grow and ferment."" 
Taiwan says the new routes, which run near two groups of Taiwan-controlled islands which sit close to China, are a threat to aviation safety and were opened by China without Taiwan's approval, contravening previous agreements.

China considers Taiwan a wayward province, and relations have cooled dramatically since Tsai Ing-wen of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party took office as Taiwan's president in 2016.

The cause of Wednesday night's fire in the city of Sapporo, on the island of Hokkaido, was still being investigated and victims were still being identified, police said.
Public broadcaster NHK coverage of the fire showed flames engulfing the three-storey building surrounded by piles of snow. Aerial footage from Thursday morning showed the blackened, smokey remains of the building.
Three of the survivors were being treated at hospital but their condition was not life-threatening, police said.
The facility was run by a Sapporo organization that helps people on welfare by providing food and assistance finding jobs, NHK said. Renters paid 36,000 yen ($330) a month, it said.
Japan is a rapidly ageing society. Over 35 million Japanese people were 65 or older last year, or 27.8 percent of the total population, up from 21.5 percent a decade ago, government data showed. 
In March 2010, seven people at a Sapporo nursing home for elderly people with dementia were killed in a fire.
Last month, 37 people died in fire at a hospital without sprinkler system in South Korea injuring more than 150 people.

Kenji Fujimori, Fujimori's youngest son whose popularity is surging, said he and nine other lawmakers had formally split from the right-wing opposition party led by his sister Keiko Fujimori, erasing the absolute majority in Congress it once used to oust ministers from Kuczynski's government.
The division came after the faction broke party ranks last month to keep Kuczynski from being removed from office in the wake of a graft scandal. Kuczynski granted Alberto Fujimori a pardon three days later on medical grounds, helping Kenji fulfill a long-standing goal to free his father.
In his first news conference since the elder Fujimori was pardoned, Kenji, 37, unveiled a political pledge on Wednesday signed by the 10 dissident lawmakers, giving the first sign of concrete political support beyond Kuczynski's party after anti-pardon street protests and resignations weakened his government.
""This is a governable agreement,"" Kenji said, holding up a document as he listed priorities that included helping Kuczynski address the needs of Peruvians and courting private investment.
Alberto Fujimori, who had been serving a 25-year prison sentence for graft and human rights crimes during his authoritarian decade in power, is a deeply divisive figure in Peru. Despite his downfall, his is admired by many who credit him with quashing a leftist insurgency and saving Peru from economic ruin.
In the past year, Fujimori has publicly sided with Kenji, not Keiko. In July, he issued a rare rebuke to the opposition party led by his daughter. [nL1N1KB02B] 
A former lawmaker, Keiko has spent a decade turning her father's legacy into Peru's most organized political party, Popular Force, but her leadership of the populist movement he started in the 1990s has been called into question.
She declined to seek Fujimori's freedom, citing a 2016 campaign pledge to only use the courts and not political powers to seek his release. She now runs behind him in polls on who is the current leader of the so-called Fujimoristas.
""We just witnessed the birth of the parliamentary group of Alberto Fujimori,"" ruling party lawmaker Juan Sheput told local news channel Canal N after Kenji's news conference.
'THE AVENGERS'
Kenji told journalists, sometimes nervously, that Popular Force had ignored his calls for internal reform after Keiko lost two consecutive presidential elections, including a 2016 tight run-off vote with Kuczynski.
""The healthy thing would be to change the party leadership ... but that never happened,"" he said, flanked by his fellow dissident lawmakers, whom he has dubbed ""the Avengers.""
Kenji is expected to make a bid for the presidency in 2021 elections, when Kuczynski cannot run due to term limits.
Keiko's spokesman and Kuczynski's spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside of regular working hours.
The secretary general of Popular Force, Jose Chlimper, said on Wednesday that the party places institutions above individuals. 
""We're sad this is happening but we have to follow our internal statutes,"" Chlimper said. Kenji, he said, had violated prohibitions on damaging the party's public image and breaking party lines on key votes.
Amid renewed calls for his impeachment, Kuczynski is counting on more of the remaining 61 Popular Force lawmakers joining Kenji, a source close to Kuczynski told Reuters last week. [nL2N1PJ013]
Lawmakers led by Kuczynski and Kenji collectively control 25 seats in Peru's 130-member Congress, not enough to thwart a new impeachment bid without help.

Congresswoman Maritza Garcia, a lawmaker loyal to Kenji, told journalists that other Popular Force lawmakers unhappy with Keiko had told her they would eventually join the faction.

328,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",Anti-Jewish sentiment 'becoming more common in Britain',"By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - Anti-Jewish sentiment is generally becoming more commonplace in Britain, a charity that provides security advice to the country's Jewish communities said on Thursday.
The Community Security Trust (CST) said better recording and publicity around alleged anti-Jewish sentiment in the opposition Labour Party was partly to blame for a record number of anti-Semitic incidents in Britain last year but also warned it reflected a general rise in anti-Semitism. 
""Hatred is rising and Jewish people are suffering as a result,"" said David Delew, chief executive of the CST, which helps protect Britain's estimated 270,000 Jews.
""It appears that the factors that led to a general, sustained high level of antisemitic incidents in 2016 have continued throughout much of 2017.""
There were 1,382 anti-Semitic incidents nationwide in 2017, a 3 percent increase from the year before which had been the previous highest annual number recorded by the CST since it began its monitoring program in 1984.
There was a 34 percent rise in the number of violent anti-Semitic assaults to 145 but most incidents related to verbal abuse of Jews in public who were identifiable from their religious clothing, school uniform or jewelry.
The CST said a fall in the number of incidents involving social media might have reflected a better response by tech firms to tackle online hate speech along with action by police to deal with prolific offenders.
While it said victims were more aware of the need to record incidents, it added it was likely there was still significant under-reporting and that the real level of anti-Semitism was much higher.
""We have the support of government and police but prosecutions need to be more visible and frequent; while too many others act in ways that encourage anti-Semites and isolate Jews,"" Delew said.
Previous spikes in anti-Semitism have been blamed on incidents and conflicts involving Israel. However, the CST said there was nothing to explain the rise seen in the last two years, indicating anti-Jewish sentiment was generally becoming more commonplace.
The charity said an increase in hate crime following the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union and controversies surrounding Labour might have emboldened offenders.
Labour has often been accused of having a problem with anti-Semitism within its ranks, particularly since socialist Jeremy Corbyn became leader in 2015, and Britain's Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis has said the party had failed to show it was sufficiently serious about tackling the problem.
""The findings of this report are extremely concerning, and emphasize just how important it is that we all make a conscious effort to call out and confront anti-Semitism,"" said Andrew Gwynne, Labour's spokesman on Communities.

The documents, which revealed top-secret details of five previous governments that under Australian law should remain secured for at least 20 years, were left inside a filing cabinet that was then sold at a store in Canberra that was stocked with ex-government furniture.
The documents were then passed onto the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that ran a string of stories, embarrassing former prime ministers and several lawmakers who still occupy prominent positions inside Australia's center-right government.
The ABC said the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation took the files after talks with the spy agency in recent days, though as part of negotiations the national broadcaster said it will still have access to the files.
The documents showed: Australia's now treasurer Scott Morrison sought to slow down security checks on refugees in order to restrict their chances of resettlement; former Prime Minister Tony Abbott considered abolishing financial aid to unemployed young Australians; the country's police lost hundreds of sensitive files.
Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said there had been a serious breach of security.
""Obviously someone's had a shocker and the investigation will find out exactly how this happened,"" Joyce told ABC radio on Thursday.
""In the process of running a country, there are things which go awry. This is one of them.""
Seeking to minimize the fallout of the security lapse, prominent conservative lawmakers have sought to focus attention on the decision of the ABC to publish details found within the top secret files.
The ABC defended the publication, insisting it was in the national interest, though former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said on Twitter on Thursday that he had launched legal action against the national broadcaster.
Rudd was this week left embarrassed after the ABC ran a story that said the former leader had ignored advice around the dangers of a home insulation package in 2008.
Rudd was later cleared on any wrongdoing by an independent investigation with sweeping powers, which he said the ABC ignored in its reporting.
""The report by the ABC alleging I ignored warnings on the risks to the safety of installers of home insulation is a lie,"" Rudd said in the statement.
""Legal proceedings against the ABC has now commenced.""

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Support for New Zealand's governing Labour Party surged to its highest level in more than a decade and approval ratings jumped for pregnant Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, a poll showed. 
Support for Labour has surged 5.4 percentage points since September's hotly contested election to 42.3 percent, its highest since it last held government in 2007, a Newshub-Reid Research poll showed on Wednesday evening.
Most of the polling was carried out after 37-year-old Ardern announced that was she was expecting her first child in June, the first New Zealand prime minister to hold office while pregnant.
The number of respondents naming Ardern as their preferred prime minister also jumped 8.3 points to 38 percent since the last poll in September, overtaking National Party leader Bill English on 26 percent.
The poll was carried out between Jan. 18 and Jan 28. Ardern announced her pregnancy to much fanfare from labor and women's rights groups on Jan. 19. 
The center-right National Party still captured the most support, mostly unchanged at 44.5 percent. 
Labour's rise was largely on the back of plummeting results for its coalition partner, the nationalist New Zealand First Party, whose support almost halved to 3.8 percent.
Labour was cast into government in October after striking a coalition deal with New Zealand First in the country's German-style proportionate voting system.
The arrangement also relied on backing from the progressive Green Party, whose support slipped 0.3 points in the latest poll to 6 percent.

The center-left coalition government, which brought an end to almost 10 years of National's center right rule, planned to pour money into social services and housing and strike a more protectionist stance by tightening up foreign investment rules.

""Be warned. What happened seven or eight years ago, will not happen again in Egypt,"" Sisi said, a reference to mass protests in 2011 that unseated long-term ruler Hosni Mubarak and ushered in years of political and economic turbulence.
""What didn't work then, will not work now. No ... it looks like you don't know me well,"" he said at the inauguration of the north African country's mammoth Zohr gas field. 
More than 150 politicians and activists called on Tuesday for voters to boycott the March election in which Sisi and a supporter-turned-challenger are the only contenders after a string of other candidates withdrew citing repression.
Those calling for a boycott included lawyer Hamdeen Sabahy, who ran against Sisi in 2014's presidential election, and Hesham Genena, the former head of Egypt's anti-corruption watchdog who had been campaigning for ex-military chief of staff Sami Anan.
Anan was arrested on Jan. 23 and halted his presidential bid after the army accused him of breaking the law by running for office without permission.
Sisi said he could ask Egyptians to take to the streets and give him a ""mandate"" in the face of what he described as ""villains"". He did not specify who or what he meant. 

""Listen, whoever wants to mess with Egypt and ruin it, has to do away with me first,"" said Sisi, who was elected in 2014, a year after he led the army to overthrow Islamist President Mohamed Mursi.

ROME (Reuters) - The leader of Italy's 5-Star Movement told international investors on Wednesday he would be willing to govern with mainstream rivals if a March 4 election produces no clear winner, a source told Reuters.
Luigi Di Maio met representatives of some of the world's largest investors and hedge funds at a private club in London's exclusive Knightsbridge district, to explain 5-Star's policies and the political prospects after the election.
""Di Maio said repeatedly that if he does not have enough seats to govern alone, he saw the likelihood of a government backed by all the main parties, including 5-Star,"" said the source, who was in the room during the day's meetings.
Di Maio later denied he had said he was willing to make post-election alliances with other parties, but said he would be willing to negotiate with them on policies.
""I will make a public appeal to all the political parties, asking them to agree on policies and on our government team, without any type of alliances,"" he posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Di Maio has gradually shifted the anti-establishment party away from its former refusal to govern with other parties, but has never said publicly he would be willing to collaborate with center-right and center-left opponents.
His reported comments in London might allay fears in the financial markets of possible political paralysis after the vote. 
The ruling center-left Democratic Party (PD) and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's center-right Forza Italia are the fiercest adversaries of 5-Star, which is the most popular single party, according to opinion polls.
""He (Di Maio) said if the election throws up political stalemate he envisaged a 4-way ruling majority made up of 5-Star, the PD, Forza Italia and the Northern League,"" said the source, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.
PUBLIC APPEAL
A center-right alliance of Forza Italia, the League and the smaller, far-right Brothers of Italy is seen winning most seats at the election but probably falling short of a majority.
5-Star currently has around 28 percent of voters' support, which would not give it nearly enough seats to govern alone.
President Sergio Mattarella is the supreme arbiter of Italian politics and is likely to play a key role in brokering any coalition accord if the election produces a hung parliament. 
Di Maio has said that if Mattarella asks him to try to form a government, he will make a public appeal for other parties to back his party's program.
There has been much media speculation that, in this case, the anti-immigration Northern League might break its alliance with Berlusconi to hook up with 5-Star in a coalition likely to be viewed with suspicion by Italy's EU partners.
Di Maio was accompanied in London by Lorenzo Fioramonti, an economics professor at Pretoria University in South Africa, who will be a 5-Star candidate at the election.
Investors also asked Di Maio about 5-Star's fiscal policies, and he assured them he would not take unilateral decisions to push up the budget deficit but planned to negotiate with the European Commission and Italy's partners, the source said.
The closed-door meetings were organized by Policy Sonar, a small, Rome-based political risk consultancy, and involved investors and hedge funds which manage more than $2 trillion.
The meetings, which ran from 7.30 a.m. until mid-afternoon, included one-on-one sessions with individual funds and a group meeting over a two-hour lunch, the source said.

""I think he made the right noises and made the right moves, and at the end of the meetings several investors told him he should come more often,"" the source said.

HAVANA (Reuters) - The European Union has offered to advise Communist-run Cuba on consolidating its two currencies, drawing on its experience from introducing the euro, an EU official said on Wednesday during a visit to Havana.
Cuba has had two currencies for more than a decade, the peso (CUP), in which most wages are paid and local goods are priced, and the convertible peso (CUC), used in tourism, foreign trade and some stores carrying imported goods.
The government has vowed to unify the currencies and there have been rumors that it would finally do so this year since President Raul Castro said in December that reform could no longer be delayed.
""We have offered technical assistance to the Cuban government to share our experience,"" said Stefano Manservisi, director general of International Cooperation and Development of the European Commission, said at a news conference.
Manservisi said the EU had ""perhaps the most significant experience worldwide in monetary transformation,"" derived from the conversion of a number of European currencies to the euro.
Manservisi's visit along with a delegation from the European Investment Bank, underscores the bloc's commitment to strengthening engagement with Cuba even as U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration back off fragile detente resumed under his predecessor Barack Obama. 
Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, visited Cuba early in January to help strengthen member countries' economic and political ties with Cuba.
As U.S.-Cuba rapprochement unfolded in 2015-2016 the EU dropped all sanctions and negotiated a political dialogue and cooperation agreement, the first between Cuba and the EU.
Diplomats in Havana have said that the EU appears to sense an opportunity, with market-oriented reforms underway in Cuba and Castro expected to make way for a new president in April. 
""We are in the middle of the modernization and transformation of Cuba's economy,"" said Manservisi.
Cuba has said the peso would remain and the CUC, valued for years at 24 pesos by state-run exchange offices, would become history.
Economists have said the current monetary system and fixed exchange rates obscure inefficiencies in the state sector and make accounting difficult, and that unifying the currencies could be a disruptive market-oriented reform.
The head of Cuba's reform commission, Marino Murillo, told the National Assembly last December that a group of 200 specialists was working intensely on the issue.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights office said on Wednesday it had identified 206 companies doing business linked to unlawful Israeli settlements in the West Bank and it urged them to avoid any complicity in ""pervasive"" violations against Palestinians.
Israel fears that companies listed on any U.N. ""blacklist"" could be targeted for boycotts or divestment aimed at stepping up pressure over its settlements, which most countries and the world body view as illegal.
""Businesses play a central role in furthering the establishment, maintenance and expansion of Israeli settlements,"" the U.N. report said. 
""In doing so, they are contributing to Israel's confiscation of land, facilitate the transfer of its population into the Occupied Palestinian Territory and are involved in the exploitation of Palestine's natural resources,"" it said.
The majority of the companies, or 143, are domiciled in Israel or the settlements, followed by 22 in the United States, it said. The remainder are based in 19 other countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, France and Britain.
The U.N. report did not name the companies and said that its database was not yet complete. 
Israel's ambassador  Aviva  (LON:AV) Raz Shechter said her government was still studying the report, launched by a resolution of the U.N. Human Rights Council in March 2016, but rejected the concept as ""fundamentally illegitimate"". 
""It is outside the competence and the authority of the Human Rights Council to deal with blacklisting ... This is part of the bias to try to delegitimise Israel,"" Raz Shechter told Reuters.
Israel did not want to see the U.N. human rights office at the ""forefront of a BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanction)"" movement, she said. 
Raz Shechter declined to discuss any of the Israeli companies or say whether some were state-owned, adding: ""Companies are not engaged in any unlawful activities.""
The report said that the work in producing the U.N. database ""does not purport to constitute a judicial process of any kind"". 
But businesses operating in the occupied territories have a corporate responsibility to carry out due diligence and consider ""whether it is possible to engage in such an environment in a manner that respects human rights"", it said. 
The office's mandate was to identify businesses involved in the construction of settlements, surveillance, services including transport, and banking and financial operations such as loans for housing.
Violations associated with the settlements are ""pervasive and devastating, reaching every facet of Palestinian life,"" the report said. It cited restrictions on freedom of religion, movement and education and lack of access to land, water and jobs.
Israel's main ally, the United States, says the 47-member Council is stacked with opponents of Israel. U.S. ambassador Nikki Haley told the Council last June that it was reviewing its participation given the forum's ""chronic anti-Israel bias"".
The report is to be debated at the U.N. Human Rights Council session of Feb 26-March 23.

Few are expecting much from the talks, which are being held in the Dominican Republic. The government and the opposition have been in on-off talks for years to reach an agreement to ease the deep political and economic crisis in the oil-rich country.
Jorge Rodriguez, Venezuela's communications minister, said in a statement to the press on Wednesday that a ""pre-agreement"" had been signed, but gave no further details.
""Today is a day for joy, despite being long and arduous,"" he said.
However, former opposition-led National Assembly president Julio Borges denied that a pre-deal had been signed.
""There are areas in which we have advanced and very important areas in which we have not advanced,"" said Borges.
Both delegations will now return to Caracas for consultations, before resuming talks at an unspecified date in the Dominican Republic.

Presidential elections are scheduled to take place before April 30, a decision that has been rejected by the opposition.

""Any citizen of the United States traveling to the 2018 Winter Games can rest assured that the Republic of Korea has a comprehensive security system in place and that the United States government is supporting our ally in that regard,"" Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told a briefing.
The Winter Games begin on Feb. 9 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, at a time of high tensions over North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programs.
After talks earlier this year aimed at defusing tensions, North and South Korea agreed to field a unified women's ice hockey team and to march their athletes under one flag at the opening ceremony.
Despite its decision to send athletes, North Korea announced it would celebrate the founding of its military on Feb. 8, an event generally marked with a large military parade displaying weapons like missile launchers. 
""While we would prefer that this parade not occur on Feb. 8, it is our hope, and I know the hope of South Korea, that the North Koreans ... will join with all the nations of the world in celebrating the athletes,"" Goldstein said.
U.S. officials said the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service was the lead U.S. agency helping South Korean authorities with security, a role it has undertaken at every Olympics since the 1976 Montreal games.
Richard Colon, a Diplomatic Security official, said the service would have about 100 personnel in South Korea, working both from the U.S. Embassy and the Olympics venues. They are assisting some 275 athletes and as many as 60,000 U.S. citizens.
Colon and other officials said organizing security for the South Korea games was no different than that of other Olympics, despite the tensions with Pyongyang.
The security officials said they were unaware of any specific threats and were confident that the South Koreans can provide a secure Olympics. They noted Seoul hosted the 2014 Asian games and the 2002 FIFA world cup.

""We have planned for all contingencies, and when I say all contingencies, you think about it, I mean we're only less than a hundred miles (200 km) from North Korea,"" said Michael Evanoff, the assistant secretary for diplomatic security. ""So we've planned for all contingencies.""

339,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",North Korea threats spur U.S. search for new radiation therapies,"By Divya Grover
(Reuters) - The escalating threat of a potential nuclear war between North Korea and the United States has led the Department of Defense to join hands with a clutch of companies in developing more effective medical treatments for acute radiation syndrome. 
The hostility between the two nations reached a new height last November after Pyongyang fired an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.
Health officials in Washington say they have adequate stocks in the event of a nuclear attack and subsequent mass radiation poisonings.
But statements by a handful of drug developers and partnerships the government have announced suggest the DoD is stepping up efforts to develop stronger treatments that could protect the military and civilians ahead of a nuclear attack. 
The DoD's budget allocated $3.9 million of its total funding to develop such medical countermeasures in 2018, an increase of $600,000 from a year ago. 
However, the numbers available on a handful of contracts issued to firms including Cleveland BioLabs Inc and privately held Humanetics Corp show funding of at least $13 million, suggesting that other departments of the military agency are investing in the area.
The reward for a successful drug developer is high: in 2013, the government spent $157 million to stockpile Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) Inc's nearly three decades old drug, Neupogen, but it and other stockpile drugs are limited as they only treat certain after-effects of radiation exposure.
Medical experts say that the increased $700 billion military budget signed into law by President Donald Trump last month could put more emphasis on programs to counter the North Korean threat and may allow a large outlay for new treatments.
The new drugs in development for radiation exposure are designed to recover the loss of all three blood lineages - white and red blood cells, and platelets - without the need for multiple blood tests or prescreening. 
Israel-based Pluristem Therapeutics Inc, Cleveland BioLabs and privately held Neumedicines Inc are all in the final stages of developing their treatments, while Humanetics is yet to initiate an early-stage trial for its oral drug. 
Pluristem has been developing an injectable drug, which could prevent or reduce the severity of radiation poisoning if taken before exposure. 
""Additional funding for the U.S. military may support more rapid development of medical countermeasures,"" Pluristem's North America division's vice president Karine Kleinhaus said.
""Leukine, Neulasta, Neupogen each only targets recovery of a sub-population of white blood cells, with no effect on the other two lineages. Pre-determination of amount of radiation exposure and serial blood tests are ... not required for PLX-R18 administration, making PLX-R18 more suitable in a mass casualty situation,"" Kleinhaus said of the company's experimental drug.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) also entered into a partnership last August with the government's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to develop drugs, focusing on the radiation issues experienced by astronauts.
NASA's radiology scientist Dr. Honglu Wu told Reuters there would certainly be interest in medicines that could be taken prior to the exposure of radiation. 
Neumedicines Chief Executive Lena Basile, whose developmental drug HemaMax is a post-exposure therapy, said the pre-exposure treatments would be undermined because they are limited to military personnel or first responders. 
""You cannot give pre-exposure drugs to the civilian population,"" she said.
Pluristem is also planning to expand its treatment for the use in cancer patients, the company's co-Chief Executive Yaky Yanay said, adding that the drug has a $1 billion market potential in revenue.
""If we are (going) to get to the chemotherapy market, we are looking at a much larger market.""

Repeated stalling of the election has raised tensions across the Democratic Republic of Congo, triggering street protests and encouraging armed rebellions, especially since Kabila refused to step down when his mandate expired at the end of 2016.
Scores have been killed by security forces at protests in the capital Kinshasa, including several in demonstrations organized by the Roman Catholic Church since the end of last year to demand that the election go ahead.
Electoral commission (CENI) head Corneille Nangaa said a total of 46,021,454 voters had been registered, 12 percent more than expected. Only the Congolese diaspora was left, and registration for them would start in July, he said.
""CENI is working to ensure the elections happen on December 23,"" he said.
Kabila, who has been in power since his father was shot dead in office in 2001, denies clinging to power and has blamed the schedule slipping on problems registering voters in the vast, heavily forested country.
Completing registration is a major step toward the election going ahead, although it is unclear to what extent this will soothe tensions among a skeptical populace.
Kabila's opponents suspect him of seeking a referendum to change Congo's constitution to enable him to run for more than two terms, as the leaders of neighboring Uganda, Rwanda and Congo Republic have. In a press conference on Friday, Kabila declined to confirm or deny this, as in the past.

Berlusconi, 81, heads an alliance of center-right and far-right parties which is leading in the polls in the run up to the March 4 parliamentary vote.
He has appeared on numerous television and radio shows since last December to campaign for his Forza Italia party (Go Italy!) but he pulled out of an interview with state television RAI on Sunday and scrapped another scheduled show on Wednesday.
La Repubblica newspaper said he was tired and suffering from high blood pressure attacks. Berlusconi sought to minimize the no-show, calling Italy's national news agency ANSA to tell them that he was ""very well"".
A senior Forza Italia politician, Renato Brunetta, told Reuters that he had spoken to Berlusconi during the day and that the billionaire media mogul was fine.
Berlusconi had open heart surgery in 2016 and he has had regular hospital check-ups and lengthy stays in health spas over the past 18 months. His last public appearance was on Jan. 22, when he went to meet EU officials in Brussels, while his last television interview was on Jan. 16.
Opinion polls suggest the center-right bloc, which includes Forza Italia and the far-right Northern League and Brothers of Italy party, will win the March 4 vote, but will fall short of an absolute majority.

Berlusconi cannot run for public office due to a 2013 tax fraud conviction, but he has presented himself as a moderating force who will keep his allies in check should they win power at the forthcoming election.

342,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 01:47PM ET</span>",More victims of ex-USA Gymnastics doctor detail abuse in court,"By Steve Friess
CHARLOTTE, Mich. (Reuters) - Jessica Thomashow said on Wednesday she was in middle school when her gymnastics doctor, Larry Nassar, sexually assaulted her for the first time under the guise of treating her injuries.
""He first molested me when I was 9 - when I was in fifth grade, before I had braces, and when I still played with my American Girl dolls,"" Thomashow, now 17, told a Michigan judge during Nassar's latest sentencing hearing. ""Larry Nassar preyed on us for his own pleasure, leaving in his wake traumatized and broken girls.""
Thomashow, a high school senior whose older sister also was abused by the doctor while a student at Michigan State University, was the first of what is expected to be at least 65 molestation victims to speak at the sentencing hearing for Nassar, the former physician for USA Gymnastics, the sport's U.S. governing body.
Nassar, 54, has pleaded guilty to two sets of abuse charges in Michigan's Ingham and Eaton counties. Nassar was sentenced last week to 40 to 175 years in prison in the Ingham County case after more than 150 victims including Olympic gold medalists recounted abuse at his hands in an emotionally wrenching week-long hearing.
Michigan Circuit Court Judge Janice Cunningham, presiding over Wednesday's Eaton County hearing, said 265 victims of Nassar have now come forward.
The hearing is expected to last several days. Nassar faces a minimum of 25 years in prison in Eaton County, though he is already assured of spending the rest of his life in prison. He is also serving a 60-year federal prison term for a child pornography conviction.
The Nassar scandal has had wide-ranging ramifications in the world of Olympic sports and beyond. Around 140 victims have filed a civil lawsuit against Nassar, USA Gymnastics and Michigan State, where he also worked, seeking monetary damages from institutions that they accused of knowing about allegations of abuse years ago and failing to stop it. 
USA Gymnastics said in a statement on Wednesday that its entire board of directors has now stepped down after U.S. Olympic officials threatened to decertify the governing body, and that it was moving forward toward assembling an interim board in February. The organization said last Friday that its remaining board members would resign in the wake of the scandal.
The U.S. Olympic Committee, which has also faced criticism from some of the biggest stars in gymnastics for failing to halt Nassar's abuse, has announced an independent investigation into its own conduct and that of USA Gymnastics.
Michigan's attorney general has launched a criminal investigation into Michigan State, and the university's president and top sports official resigned last week following Nassar's sentencing.
The U.S. Congress, which plans hearings into the scandal, has passed legislation to require USOC officials to immediately report any allegations of abuse to law enforcement.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Monday asked a state law enforcement agency to investigate Karolyi Ranch, a training facility where female athletes said they were molested by Nassar.
In an interview on Wednesday with NBC's ""Today"" show, Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles, who has disclosed that Nassar molested her, said Nassar's abuse had stayed with her years later.

""It feels like he took a part of me that I can't get back,"" said Biles, considered one of the greatest gymnasts in history.

343,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Swiss see no quick deal on new EU treaty,"By Michael Shields
ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland will not meet the European Commission's deadline for a deal in the early part of this year on a new treaty that would bind the neutral country more closely to its biggest trading partner, new Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said.
The Bern government still needs to clarify exactly what it wants from an accord that would replace the current patchwork of bilateral sectoral agreements, Cassis told reporters after a meeting of a cabinet sharply divided over European policy.
Cassis, of the pro-business Free Democrats, won fans among the right-wing Swiss People's Party by promising last year to hit the ""reset"" button in ties with the EU, but has since said he would like to see a deal on a new treaty within months.
Asked on Wednesday about European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's demand to see progress on a treaty by spring, Cassis said: ""That was never a decision of Switzerland. This was a communication of the European Union ... We will not have a market access treaty wrapped up by April.""
Brussels has heaped pressure on Bern to sign a treaty under which non-EU member Switzerland would adopt EU laws governing the single market as the price of enhanced access. It would have the European Court of Justice help settle any disputes. 
This is anathema to the anti-immigration People's Party, which is the largest in parliament and has two of seven cabinet seats. Many Swiss conservatives are also wary of giving ""foreign judges"" such power and are keen to see what kind of EU deal Britain can swing after its vote in 2016 to leave the EU.
Brussels played hardball last year by putting Switzerland on a watch list of tax havens and granting for only one year Swiss stock exchange access to the single market, with any extension linked to agreeing a treaty.
It falls now to Cassis to help forge a compromise. 
""The quality is more important than the timing. The cabinet will never agree something that damages Switzerland, even in the next 40 years,"" he said.
Cassis named a new team to handle the Europe portfolio, appointing veteran diplomat Roberto Balzaretti as state secretary in charge of European affairs and the point man for coordinating EU negotiations.
Cassis said Bern was reviewing new approaches to settling disputes that arise under a treaty. He was not more specific, but sources close to the talks have said the EU proposed letting a special arbitration court handle some disputes.
The treaty issue is politically fraught ahead of elections in both Switzerland and the EU in 2019, which in effect means any deal has to be done this year.

""We have around 10 months ahead of us to review the blockade,"" Cassis said, referring to the logjam in talks with the EU. ""If it works, it works. If not, then it doesn't. Then we have to go back over the books and see how it will go. It is clear not much will happen in 2019.""

344,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Letter from Trump prompts African leaders to refrain from criticizing him,"By Aaron Maasho
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - African leaders say they have decided to refrain from issuing a resolution to criticize Donald Trump's alleged reference to their nations as ""shithole countries"" because the U.S. president sent them a letter expressing respect for the continent.
The leaders who met at an African Union summit in the Ethiopian capital were initially set to demand an apology from Trump over the remark reported by sources at a meeting on immigration with him this month. Trump denies making the comment.
Reports of the comment touched a nerve because they come on top of decisions by the Trump administration, particularly on visa restrictions, that many Africans say unfairly penalize the continent. 
As the summit was being held at ministerial level, the gathering drafted a resolution calling on Trump to ""publicly apologize to all Africans"".
Anything short of that would force them to suspend a cooperation deal signed between Washington and the bloc, said the draft seen by Reuters.
African leaders are ""dismayed and shocked by the increasingly consistent trend by the Trump Administration to denigrate of African descent ... thereby promoting racism, xenophobia and bigotry,"" it said.
But a Jan. 25 letter sent by Trump prompted a change of tack at presidential level.
One summit official said the final resolution that is yet to be released contains no reference to the issue after the leaders concluded the meeting late on Monday.
""I want to underscore that the United States deeply respects the people of Africa and my commitment to strong and respectful relationships with African states as sovereign states is firm,"" Trump said.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would ""travel to Africa for an extended visit,"" he said.
The AU Commission had ""taken due note"" of the letter, which wished the summit success, Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat said during the closing press conference.
Rwanda's President Paul Kagame, who met Trump last week on the sidelines of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said Trump's reported comment had no impact on the AU summit.
""When the United States decided to give us Trump as their president we deal with that president of the United States. It is not an issue of whether you appreciate him for this or for that, it is a job that he is doing for his country,"" added Kagame, who assumed the African Union's chairmanship this year.

He said both he and Trump had stressed the need for more cooperation.

Gabriel adopted a markedly different tone to that of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who on a visit to Israel last week embraced President Donald Trump's Dec. 6 announcement that his administration recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and that it will move the U.S. Embassy to the city.
""With regard to the Palestinians and the Iran question the Americans are taking your side more clearly than ever before. But is this really only a good thing?"" Gabriel said in Tel Aviv.
Citing past successes of U.S. diplomacy in the region, he asked: ""Can the Americans still play such a role if they take sides so openly? Will others try to step into their shoes?""
In a thinly veiled threat about cutting off aid, he said some members of Israel's cabinet were ""explicitly against the two-state solution"" but that such a solution ""has always been the foundation of our engagement for Israeli-Palestinian peace and for the large amount of funding"" from Germany and Europe.
""These – at best mixed – signals do not go unnoticed in Europe, where there is clearly growing frustration with Israel's actions,"" he told an Israeli security conference. Gabriel cited disagreements even within his own Social Democratic Party about what some see as ""unfair"" treatment of the Palestinians.
""NO SHORTCUT""
""It is increasingly difficult for people like me to explain to them the reasons why our support for Israel must persist,"" he said. Gabriel pointed to concerns about violence, hatred, and Israeli settlement-building in occupied territory that Palestinians seek for a future independent state.
""Germany is looking forward to the day when it will be able to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. But let me add: in two states with Jerusalem as their capital. There is no shortcut here.""
Palestinians want East Jerusalem, which was captured by Israeli in a 1967 war, for their future capital. Israel regards Jerusalem as its eternal, indivisible capital.
Gabriel spoke after meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
Earlier in the day Netanyahu corrected the record during a joint news conference held with his German visitor after Gabriel said he was encouraged that Netanyahu's government supported a two-state solution ""with secure Israeli borders"".
""That we will control security west of the Jordan (river). That is the first condition,"" Netanyahu objected, cutting Gabriel off and adding, ""Whether it’s defined as a state when we have the military control is another matter. I'd rather not discuss labels, but substance.""
Gabriel suggested that the discussion might be revisited at another time, ""far away from now"".
Gabriel has been an outspoken supporter of greater efforts to combat anti-Semitism in Germany, including creation of a new government commissioner post to oversee such initiatives.

At the same time, he is under pressure at home to take a hard line on the continued building of Israeli settlements in violation of international law.

BEIRUT/TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel described as ""very provocative"" on Wednesday a Lebanese offshore oil and gas exploration tender in disputed territory on the countries' maritime border, and said it was a mistake for international firms to participate.
Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, whose country considers Israel an enemy state, said the comments were one of several ""threatening messages"" from Israel in recent days. 
Lebanese political and military movement Hezbollah vowed to defend the country's ""oil and gas rights"" against Israeli threats.
Lebanon is on the Levant Basin in the eastern Mediterranean where a number of big sub-sea gas fields have been discovered since 2009, including the Leviathan and Tamar fields located in Israeli waters near the disputed marine border with Lebanon. 
Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said: ""When they issue a tender on a gas field, including Block 9, which by any standard is ours ... this is very, very challenging and provocative conduct here.""
""Respectable firms"" bidding on the tender ""are, to my mind, making a grave error - because this is contrary to all of the rules and all protocol in cases like this,"" he told an international security conference hosted by Tel Aviv University's INSS think-tank. 
Lebanon in December approved a bid by a consortium of France's Total, Italy's Eni and Russia's Novatek for two of the five blocks put up for tender in the country's much-delayed first oil and gas offshore licensing round.
One of the awarded blocks, Block 9, borders Israeli waters. Lebanon has an unresolved maritime border dispute with Israel over a triangular area of sea of around 860 sq km (330 square miles) that extends along the edge of three of the blocks.
Israel has not issued its own tenders for Block 9, with its officials saying they were focused on blocks that would not be disputed.
""Lieberman's words about Block 9 are a threat to Lebanon and its right to sovereignty over its territorial waters,"" Lebanese President Michel Aoun said on his official Twitter account. 
Hariri said the country would take up the comments with the ""relevant international bodies to affirm its right to act in its territorial waters"". In a statement from his press office, the premier said Lieberman's words were ""blatant provocation"". 
Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil said he had sent a letter to the United Nations two weeks ago affirming Lebanon's right to defend itself and its economic interests. 
Hezbollah described the comments as ""a new aggression"" and said it would ""decisively confront any assault on our oil and gas rights.""
Israel last went to war in Lebanon in 2006, against Iran-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah. The month-long war in 2006 killed around 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 Israelis, most of them troops. 
With tensions rising anew, Lieberman, a far-rightist in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conservative coalition government, said Lebanon would ""pay the full price"" for any new Hezbollah attacks on Israel. 
He said that the Lebanese army was indistinguishable from Hezbollah and both were fair game in any future war.
But he said Israel sought no war, adding: ""We try to conduct ourselves determinedly and responsibly.""
The offshore exploration and production contracts are expected to be officially signed on Feb. 9, Energy Minister Cesar Abi Khalil said, allowing exploration to begin.

Baerbel Kofler criticized Tehran's reported execution of Ali Kazemi, 22, on Monday, and said the man's attorney had not even been informed of the pending execution. 
Kazemi had been accused of fatally wounding another youth in a brawl involving several other people.
Kofler urged Tehran to halt the planned execution of another man, Hamid Ahmadi, 27, who was 17 at the time of his alleged crime, saying there were ""significant doubts"" about whether the rule of law was sufficiently applied in his trial.
Ahmadi was convicted and sentenced to death in 2009, with the sentence reaffirmed in a second trial in 2016. He was also accused of killing another youth with a knife during a group fight. His execution is expected at any time.
""This policy of executions must stop,"" Kofler said in a statement. The executions were in direct violation of U.N. conventions on the rights of children and international treaties on civil and political rights signed by Iran, he said.
Germany remains committed to the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, but has been outspoken about Iran's violation of human rights, its support for violence in the region and its continued development of long-range missiles.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia does not believe there is a case for United Nations action against Iran, Russia's U.N. ambassador said on Wednesday after traveling to Washington to view pieces of weapons that Washington says Tehran gave Yemen's Houthi group.
The Trump administration has for months been lobbying for Iran to be held accountable at the United Nations, while at the same time threatening to quit a 2015 deal among world powers to curb Iran's nuclear program if ""disastrous flaws"" are not fixed.
""We only heard some vague talk about some action,"" Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said on Wednesday. ""If there is something (proposed) we will see. How can we pass judgment prematurely before we know what it is about?""
Asked if there was a case against Iran at the United Nations, Nebenzia answered: ""No.""
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley took her 14 Security Council colleagues to a military hangar near Washington on Monday to see remnants of what the Pentagon said was an Iranian-made ballistic missile fired from Yemen on Nov. 4 at Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh, as well as other weapons.
A proxy war is playing out in Yemen between Iran and U.S. ally Saudi Arabia. Iran has denied supplying the Iran-allied Houthis with such weaponry and described the arms displayed in Washington as ""fabricated.""
""Yemen hosts a pile of weapons from the old days, many countries competing to supply weapons to Yemen during the time of (former) President (Ali Abdullah) Saleh, so I cannot give you anything conclusive,"" Nebenzia said. ""I am not an expert to judge.""
Independent U.N. experts reported to the Security Council in January that Iran had violated U.N. sanctions on Yemen because ""it failed to take the necessary measures to prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer"" of ballistic missiles and other equipment to the Houthi group.
Nebenzia questioned whether there was conclusive evidence. He said it was up to the Security Council's Yemen sanctions committee - made up of diplomats from the council's 15 members - to address the report by the U.N. experts.
Kazakhstan U.N. Ambassador Kairat Umarov, Security Council president for January, also suggested the evidence shown to council envoys in Washington may not be enough for U.N. action.
""Unfortunately we don't know how this weaponry was delivered to Yemen,"" he told reporters on Wednesday.
Haley has said the United States was considering several possible U.N. options for action against Iran, including tightening ballistic missile restrictions on Tehran or imposing targeting sanctions on Iranian individuals or entities. 

Diplomats have said Haley has not signaled which accountability option she might pursue or when.

The State Department said in a statement that Haniyeh, along with two Islamist groups active in Egypt and one in the Palestinian territories, were listed as specially designated global terrorists.
It quoted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as saying the designations ""target key terrorist groups and leaders – including two sponsored and directed by Iran – who are threatening the stability of the Middle East, undermining the peace process, and attacking our allies Egypt and Israel.""
In Gaza, Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters: ""We reject and condemn the decision and we see it as a reflection of the domination by a gang of Zionists of the American decision.""The decision is worthless,"" he added.
Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip, advocates Israel's destruction and is designated as a terrorist group by the United States and some other Western countries.
In December, after U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Haniyeh told a rally in Gaza marking the 30th anniversary of Hamas's founding: ""We will knock down Trump's decision. No superpower is capable of offering Jerusalem to Israel, there is no Israel that it should have a capital named Jerusalem.""
The three groups designated by the State Department are:
- Harakat al-Sabireen, which the statement said is backed by Iran, operates primarily in Gaza and the West Bank, and fired rockets into Israel;
- Liwa al-Thawra, which it said has claimed responsibility for killing an Egyptian army general in Cairo in 2016 and a bombing in 2017;
- Harakat Sawa’d Misr (HASM), which it said claimed responsibility for killing an Egyptian security officer and other attacks.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Romania's President Klaus Iohannis told the European Union on Wednesday he would fight for the independence of his country's courts, which he and Brussels say is threatened by draft laws prepared by the Social Democrat-led government.
The EU's executive Commission said the laws, if approved, would ensure Romania remained outside the bloc's Schengen zone of free travel, though it said it had no plans to initiate a punitive procedure against Bucharest over that.
The EU is concerned that Bucharest's judicial overhaul will reverse any progress Romania has achieved in fighting high-level graft in one of Europe's most corrupt countries. Romania's judicial system remains under special EU monitoring.
""I am very much preoccupied by the legislative procedure regarding the changing of the laws of justice,"" Iohannis told a joint news conference with Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. 
""The independence of the Romanian justice is something I will fight for,"" added Iohannis, a centrist and outspoken critic of the ruling leftist coalition in Bucharest.
Under the draft laws, approved by parliament last month, offences involving an abuse of public office that causes financial damage of less than 200,000 euros ($249,000) would no longer carry a penalty.
Romania's constitutional tribunal has sent some of the draft laws back to parliament for reworking, and Iohannis, whose signature is required for them to take effect, said he was determined that they fully meet EU standards.
""I am worried and I made it clear that I do have concerns,"" the EU's Juncker said.
The Commission has previously said Romania and its southern neighbor Bulgaria should be allowed to join the Schengen zone of passport-free travel, but many EU states remain opposed due to the concerns over corruption and lack of transparency.
Joining Schengen is a key objective for Bucharest, but Juncker cautioned: ""If the Romanian legislation was to remain as was foreseen by the parliament, then... the accession of Romania to Schengen would be looked at in completely different terms.""
However, Juncker said he had ""no intention whatsoever"" to launch punitive action against Romania under the EU's Article 7 over the rule of law concerns.
The Commission has invoked Article 7 against Poland over Warsaw's overhaul of the judiciary, though Hungary would be expected to block any attempt to suspend its Polish ally's voting rights in the European Council in consequence.

The EU's ability to rein in member states which pass laws that undermine core democratic principles is a key challenge facing the bloc, amid a growing divergence between its wealthy, liberal western states and newer, more conservatively-minded eastern members.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's government said on Wednesday it would hand over to parliament a leaked report that suggested Brexit would hurt the economy, trying to deflect accusations that ministers are badly prepared for leaving the European Union.
The report has struck at the heart of government Brexit strategy, with one minister suggesting that analysis by officials should be discounted and another urging the government to reconsider its stance.
It has piled pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, who is under fire from some in her own Conservative Party for lacking leadership and a clear Brexit plan, as she negotiates a deal to end more than 40 years of union.
The main opposition Labour Party forced the government into handing over the report, entitled ""EU Exit Analysis - Cross Whitehall Briefing"" and dated January 2018, by using an ancient parliamentary procedure. Parliament's treasury committee called on the government to publish immediately.
""In seeing this analysis, members of the House will be sharing in the responsibility and obligation that the government has to ensure the security of negotiation-sensitive materials,"" junior Brexit minister Steve Baker told parliament.
He said the report, which he denied was any kind of impact assessment, would be kept ""strictly confidential"" and unpublished during the Brexit negotiations.
The report leaked to BuzzFeed News said the economy would be worse off after Brexit whether Britain left the EU with a free trade deal, single market access, or with no deal at all. The government has called it a partial piece of work that had yet to be signed-off by ministers. 
How to deal with its leak has exposed divisions in government.
Earlier on Wednesday, May, on a visit to China, said lawmakers would be given official analysis on any Brexit deal before they are asked to approve it.
On Tuesday, Baker rebuffed calls for the government to release the full report by saying it was not ready, while Phillip Lee, a minister at the justice department, suggested the government change tack in the talks.
Lee was rebuked on Wednesday for expressing on Twitter his suggestion that if the report were true ""there would be a serious question over whether a government could legitimately lead a country along a path that the evidence and rational consideration indicate would be damaging"".
Government aides say the paper had not even considered the government's preferred goal of a bespoke future relationship with the EU after leaving.
But it has raised further questions over how prepared the government is for the complicated negotiations to end Britain's membership of the EU.

""This is a victory for parliament and for our country,"" said Labour's Brexit policy chief Keir Starmer. ""Labour ... expects ministers to hand these documents over by the end of the week. To not do so would obstruct the will of parliament.""

352,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Czech government raises quota for fast-lane work permits for Ukrainians,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech government agreed on Wednesday to double the number of Ukrainians it was allowing in as fast-track migrant workers to 19,600 per year, aiming to help firms struggling to find workers and facing pressure from the workforce for wage hikes. 
The decision, raising the quota for easy access to the Czech market from 9,600 last year and 3,800 before, is in contrast to a hostility to would-be asylum seekers from predominantly Muslim countries whom many Czechs see as security risks.
The Czech Republic has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union, 2.3 percent under Eurostat methodology, and companies see labor shortage as the biggest business obstacle.
""We are reacting to employers' problems with finding labor force,"" Foreign Minister Martin Stropnicky said on Twitter. 
He said the plan would also apply in smaller extent to workers for Mongolia and the Philippines.
The Czechs are facing an EU legal suit for refusing to accept asylum-seekers under the union's system meant to relieve countries hit most by immigration.
The Czech Republic already has 117,000 legally residing Ukrainians, the largest foreign community in the country, followed by Slovaks and Vietnamese. Ukrainians are also the most frequent nationality among foreigners found to be in the country illegally. 
Ukraine, which is not in the EU, has been a favored source of migrant workers for the Czech Republic due to its geographical proximity and cultural and linguistic links.
Ukraine's own economy has suffered since the fall of the Soviet Union from mismanagement and corruption, and has been badly damaged by a nearly four-year conflict in the east of the country with separatists backed by Russia.
The Czech annual quota for easy access was already raised last year from previous 3,800.
The country of 10.6 million people had 216,629 job vacancies in December, the highest on record, versus 259,929 available unemployed workers.
Manufacturing is a key driver of economic growth in the Czech Republic, with foreign-owned firms feeding into multinational supply chains in the auto, machinery and electronics industries.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's prosecutors on Wednesday named the head of football club Benfica, Luis Filipe Vieira, as a formal suspect in an investigation into a corruption scheme, the second high-profile inquiry to involve the Lisbon club in less than a week.
The prosecutor general's office said Benfica Vice President Fernando Tavares was also a suspect in the case, along with a high-ranking judge and nine other people, five of whom were detained in a police operation on Tuesday. 
The club's lawyer, Joao Correia, declined to comment on the investigation against either man. Benfica said the investigation had nothing to do with the club itself. Vieira and Tavares were not immediately available for comment.
Police on Tuesday raided the premises of the Portuguese champions, as well as Vieira's home, among other locations in Lisbon and elsewhere.
Benfica is Portugal's most popular club by membership.
The prosecutor's office said the investigation focused on ""suspicions of receiving undue advantages, or possibly corruption, money laundering, influence peddling and tax fraud,"" but would not provide specific details.
The prosecutors said the investigation is linked to a long-running case that involves former Benfica director Jose Veiga, who was detained in 2016 on suspicions of corruption and money laundering in his business dealings in various countries, from Portugal to Cape Verde, Equatorial Guinea, Congo and Gabon.
Benfica and its president also made headlines over the weekend after police on Friday searched the finance ministry. 
Local media said the raid targeted finance chief Mario Centeno, who heads the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, over his alleged request last year for tickets to a Benfica-Porto game and on Vieira's alleged role in obtaining a property tax break for his son.
The prosecutor's office said that was a separate investigation to the one that named Vieira a suspect, and nobody has been accused of any crime. The finance ministry has said Centeno obtained his tickets without breaching any rules, and denied any government interference in Vieira's tax matters.

Prime Minister Antonio Costa has dismissed the tickets allegations as ""ridiculous"" and having ""no impact on the credibility and good name of Centeno"", who he said will stay on as finance minister.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - The United States pledged continued support for Lebanon's military on Wednesday, calling it a potential counterweight to Iranian-backed Hezbollah, even as Israel said the two forces were indistinguishable and fair game in any future war.
Such a public difference of opinion between the allies was remarkable enough, but especially so as it was sounded by senior officials at the same event - an Israeli security conference.
The Lebanese Armed Forces took no part in the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. It has received more than $1.5 billion in U.S. military assistance since then and, in the last seven years, training and support from U.S. special forces too.
With Hezbollah having helped sway the Syrian civil war in President Bashar al-Assad's favor, Israel and the United States worry that the Shi'ite militia could now broaden its clout in its Lebanese heartland. 
""We will sustain our efforts to support legitimate state security institutions in Lebanon, such as the Lebanese Armed Forces, which is the only legitimate force in Lebanon,"" David Satterfield, acting assistant U.S. secretary of state, told the conference organized by Tel Aviv University's INSS think-tank.
Satterfield added that the Lebanese army ""could well serve as a counterweight to Hezbollah's desire to expand its own influence there, as well as Iran's reach in Lebanon"".
But taking the stage three hours later, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman reiterated his view that the Lebanese army was under the command of the better-equipped Hezbollah.
""As far as I'm concerned, all of Lebanon - the Lebanese army, Lebanon and the Lebanese army - are no different from Hezbollah,"" he said. ""They are part of Hezbollah and they will all pay the full price"" for any large-scale attack on Israel.
There was no immediate response from Hezbollah or the Lebanese military. 
The Lebanese military has previously said it operates independently from Hezbollah, most recently during an operation against Islamic State at the Lebanese-Syrian border last year.
Israeli intelligence officials told Reuters last year that they believed the Lebanese army maintained autonomy even if some of its personnel cooperated with Hezbollah.
The INSS conference coincided with heightened concern in Israel about what it describes as Iranian efforts to fit precision-guidance systems onto Hezbollah's longer-range missiles. Such improvements could potentially allow Hezbollah to knock out key Israeli infrastructure. 
Washington shares these worries, according to Nathan Sales, the State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism. 
""We're very concerned about Hezbollah developing an indigenous weapons manufacturing capability or alteration capability inside Lebanon,"" Sales told Reuters at the conference. 
He declined to comment on how far advanced such missile projects might be, but said the United States was trying to hinder them and other Hezbollah capabilities by using sanctions to dent the $700 million that Iran gives the militia annually. 
Neither Hezbollah nor Iran has responded to such charges. 

Israel has also been lobbying Russia - which has some sway over Iran and Hezbollah because of their alliance in Syria. Israeli officials said they hosted a senior Russian security delegation on Wednesday, with the missile issue on the agenda.

John Tshibangu, who had been based in the lawless east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), this month issued a video ""hereby giving 45-day notice to Kabila to step down from power ... (or) we are going to take Kabila down"".
""I am ready to take up arms and fight ... the dictator who has killed our compatriots in the Kasai region and in the east,"" he said. It was unclear what firepower or manpower he had to back up his statement.
Defence Minister Crispin Atama Tabe said Tshibangu was being held but did not give further details.
""If the extradition request does not succeed, the DRC may request him to be tried in Tanzania, but for now Congolese military justice ... is working (on) his extradition,"" he said.
Tanzanian authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tshibangu was once a military commander in the central Congolese region of Kasai, but defected in 2012 and moved eastwards. 
Kabila's refusal to step down when his mandate expired in December 2016 has emboldened several armed groups, raising the prospect of the vast, mineral-rich nation sliding back into the kind of warfare that killed millions in the 1990s, mostly from hunger and disease. 
As well as rebel groups in the east, fighting between ethnic militia and government forces in Kasai region - not thought to have anything to do with Tshibangu - has killed thousands of people and displaced more than three quarters of a million.

The ""White Paper on Human Rights Violations in the U.S. in 2017"", was issued by the Institute of International Studies in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and circulated by its diplomatic mission in Geneva.
It did not refer to the row between North Korea and the United States and its allies over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs, or to the international sanctions imposed against it. 
U.S. President Donald Trump, in his first State of Union speech to Congress on Tuesday, branded North Korea’s leadership ""depraved"". He told Americans that its pursuit of nuclear missiles could ""very soon threaten our homeland"" and vowed a continued campaign to prevent that.
""Racial discrimination and misanthropy are serious maladies inherent to the social system of the U.S., and they have been aggravated since Trump took office,"" the North Korean paper said.
""The racial violence that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, on August 12 is a typical example of the acme of the current administration's policy of racism,"" it said.
Trump, who took office a year ago, had filled his cabinet with billionaires, it said, citing U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnunchin and Secretary of Defense James Mattis.
""The total assets of public servants at the level of deputy secretary and above of the current administration are worth $14 billion,"" the paper said. 
North Korea's paper said that genuine freedoms of the press and of expression did not exist in the United States and that crackdowns against the media had intensified in the past year.
More people have joined the ranks of the unemployed and the homeless, it said.
The United State is one of few countries that have failed to offer paid maternity leave, and many sick citizens cannot afford to pay their medical fees, it added.
The paper, issued weeks before the main annual session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, said: 

""The U.S., 'guardian of democracy' and 'human rights champion', is kicking up the human rights racket but it can never camouflage its true identity as the gross violator of human rights.""

357,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",German parties agree on climate as coalition talks progress,"By Andreas Rinke and Markus Wacket
BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives agreed with their would-be Social Democrat (SPD) partners on Wednesday on climate targets for 2030, a sign of steady progress in coalition talks which both sides aim to conclude within a week.
Merkel, weakened after losing votes to the far-right in a September election, is pinning her hopes for a fourth term on a re-run of the 'grand coalition' with the SPD to end four months of political limbo in Europe's biggest economy.
After a breakthrough on the contentious issue of family reunions for migrants on Tuesday - although it was overshadowed by a subsequent row over the details - the parties ticked off other, less tricky, issues including climate policy.
Reflecting a blueprint deal reached in exploratory talks earlier this month, the parties effectively dropped the previous government's target to reduce CO2 emissions by 40 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels.
While 'recognizing' that goal, documents seen by Reuters show the focus is instead on a legally binding 2030 goal to cut emissions by 55 percent via savings in transport, agriculture, energy and buildings, supported by tax incentives or subsidies. 
An unexpected intervention on climate policy came from across the Atlantic. Green activist and former Democrat U.S. presidential candidate Al Gore called on the conservatives and Social Democrats to agree to phase out coal by 2030. 
""This is your moment to lead and help solve the climate crisis,"" tweeted Gore.
He is likely to be disappointed as the parties have only committed to draw up a plan to phase out coal-generated electricity and set a date for its end, without indicating when.
PENSIONS, CARE, PAY 
Working groups are wading through the details of the framework deal on policies from Europe to tax and migrants.
Earlier, the parties had agreed to cap pension contributions, divided between workers and employers, at 20 percent of an individual's salary to 2025, party sources said. 
The SPD, which failed to win voters with a campaign focused on social justice, had before the election wanted a cap of 21.8 percent until 2030 from 18.7 percent.
In the blueprint deal, the parties also agreed to stabilize pensions at 48 percent of the average wage by 2025. 
The parties have also agreed to keep social security payments to below 40 percent of gross pay and to give companies the chance to write down digital investments. 
Late on Tuesday, the parties also agreed on steps to create 8,000 more jobs in the care sector and improve pay. 
The SPD are pushing for tweaks that will help its leaders sell a final coalition deal to its 440,000 members, many of whom are against joining Merkel's conservatives again. 
Any deal will depend on the approval of SPD members who will be balloted after party leaders agree - possibly at the end of the weekend or early next week.
Already, the JUSOS youth wing of the SPD has sharply criticized the deal on family reunions for migrants, saying the SPD leaders had not delivered sufficient improvements from the exploratory talks blueprint.

""If we don't succeed in getting more out of the negotiations overall, we must break off talks with the conservatives,"" JUSOS leader Kevin Kuehnert told Deutschlandfunk radio.

358,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 10:51AM ET</span>",Far-right AfD lawmaker becomes chair of German budget committee,"By Michelle Martin
BERLIN (Reuters) - A lawmaker from the eurosceptic, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) who has criticised euro zone rescues and the European Central Bank has been chosen as the chair of parliament's influential budget committee.
The top job in what is nicknamed the ""king's committee"" due to its power in scrutinizing government ministries' budgets is traditionally reserved for the largest opposition party. That is set to be the AfD if Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) seal a new coalition.
The committee voted on Wednesday to accept AfD candidate Peter Boehringer, who rose to prominence by campaigning for the repatriation of Germany's gold reserves from overseas. He has also called for an ""immediate end to mass illegal Islamic migration to Europe that threatens our existence"".
The AfD and the pro-market Free Democrats (FDP) voted in favor of Boehringer, 48, while the conservatives, SPD and Greens abstained. The far-left Linke voted against him.
The AfD also succeeded on Wednesday in securing the chairmanship of two other parliamentary committees - for legal affairs and tourism.
Striking a conciliatory tone after the budget committee vote, Boehringer, a former corporate consultant, told reporters he was optimistic that the parties would be able to work well together on the panel.
""The budget committee will be well managed and... in my opinion, in a balancing way. Of course we won't create a spectacle in the budget committee,"" he said.
Boehringer wants all of Germany's gold repatriated from vaults in New York, Paris and elsewhere, but he has also said this is not a matter for the budget committee.
CONCERNS
The AfD, which surged into parliament in last September's election with nearly 13 percent of the vote amid public concerns over a mass influx of migrants into Germany, wants the country to leave the euro zone and re-introduce the deutsche mark.
There have been concerns the AfD will become more credible and legitimate by taking positions like the budget committee chair but the other parties said they respected the AfD had earned the role with its strong election result.
Mainstream parties are keen to avoid the impression of disadvantaging the AfD by changing rules or traditions as they do not want it to have grounds to complain of unfair treatment.
Boehringer has played down expectations of what he can do in the new job, telling Reuters on Tuesday the AfD would not be able to thwart government plans to spend on refugees or possible euro zone bailouts as mainstream parties have a majority in the committee and so would outvote it. [L8N1PP721]
The former head of the budget committee - Gesine Loetzsch, a member of the far-left Linke - said she had concerns about the choice of Boehringer, especially as he would have to represent the committee to international organizations.
""We've noticed that he has made racist and misogynist comments and that's not a good foundation for representing the committee,"" she said.

The new AfD chair of the legal affairs committee, Stephan Brandner, is a close ally of Bjoern Hoecke, a regional party leader who provoked outrage last year when he described Berlin's Holocaust Memorial as a ""monument of shame"".

The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission has not had a permanent chair since Rita Makarau resigned in December. 
Makarau was seen as an ally of 93-year-old former president Robert Mugabe, whose increasingly repressive 37-year rule alienated African and Western nations alike. But she gave no reason for her resignation, a month after Mugabe stepped down when the army and his ZANU-PF party turned against him.
A copy of Chigumba's appointment letter written by the chief secretary to Mnangagwa and his cabinet showed that Chigumba would start her new job immediately and was expected to be sworn-in on Thursday.
A government source also confirmed her appointment.
Mnangagwa said last week the southern African country would hold transparent elections by July and he would respect the result if the opposition wins.

Chigumba's last high-profile case was in November when she freed activist pastor Evan Mawarire, who had faced trial on charges of attempting to subvert Mugabe's government.

Aoun's son-in-law, Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, was caught on camera calling Berri ""a thug"" earlier this week, causing protests in Beirut and gunfire near offices of Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) east of the capital on Monday.
""The government will continue but it might stumble because of the current political tension,"" al-Manar, controlled by the powerful Shi'ite group Hezbollah, cited Berri as saying.
The row has worsened a standoff between Berri, a Shi'ite, and Aoun, a Maronite Christian, that threatens to ignite sectarian tensions in the run-up to a parliamentary election in May. 
The FPM said on Tuesday that Bassil had already expressed regret for the comments and that it regarded the issue as over. But Berri, in comments to MPs on Wednesday, pressed his demand for an apology ""to the Lebanese"" for ""the insults that happened"".
Berri and Aoun, both in their 80s, were enemies in the 1975-90 civil war.
Berri and Aoun's parties are two of the most powerful groups in the coalition government that was formed in 2016. Lebanon has suffered long periods of paralysis in government as a result of political tensions in recent years. 
""The constitutional institutions not the street are the right venues to resolve political disputes,"" Aoun said on his official Twitter feed on Wednesday. 
Political tensions between Berri and Aoun have been rising since December when Aoun signed a decree promoting dozens of army officers without the signature of Shi'ite Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil, one of Berri's closest aides.
The row has shattered a rare moment of national unity that saved Lebanon from strife during the crisis over Hariri's shock resignation in November, which he later rescinded. 

The tensions have also shaken Aoun's ties with the Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah, whose links to Berri and Amal run much deeper than its political alliance with the FPM, which was founded by Aoun and is now led by Bassil.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Three Kenyan TV stations will stay off the air indefinitely as the government investigates a ""swearing in"" of opposition leader Raila Odinga, the interior minister said on Wednesday, following the symbolic but direct challenge to President Uhuru Kenyatta.
Independently owned Citizen TV and Radio, KTN News and NTV were switched off on Tuesday after they transmitted live coverage of an opposition ceremony to ""swear in"" Odinga into office.
Fred Matiang'i, who is also the minister in charge of security, accused some elements in the media of facilitating the ""illegal act"", putting lives of thousands of Kenyans at risk.
""The government took a decision to shut down the concerned media houses, until further notice, as it launches a full investigation,"" he told a news conference.
Odinga, whose supporters say he is Kenya's legitimate leader and Kenyatta's election was neither free nor fair, took a symbolic presidential oath at the ceremony.
Matiang'i said the opposition event was an attempt to subvert and overthrow the legally constituted government, adding they were also investigating the ""swearing in"". 
""The investigations will extend to co-conspirators and facilitators,"" he said, promising appropriate legal action against those found culpable.
Police later arrested Tom Kajwang, an opposition lawmaker who administered Odinga's ""oath of office"", James Orengo, an opposition senator, told Reuters.
Kajwang, who represents a constituency in Nairobi and is a lawyer by profession, turned up at the opposition gathering in a white wig and a black robe, mimicking the official robes the chief justice wears when inaugurating a president. 
LOSSES
Earlier, executives in the media industry accused the government of keeping them in the dark over the switch-off of their broadcast stations.
""There was no comment from the government when the action was taken, and there's been none since,"" said Wachira Waruru, managing director of Royal Media Services, which owns Citizen TV and Radio.
Attempts by Reuters to reach Kenya's Communications Authority for comment by telephone on Wednesday were unsuccessful. 
""We're trying to reach out informally to government officials, but we are not getting any answers,"" Waruru said. ""Our business is advertising-based so we are making huge losses,"" he said, declining to give a figure.
The stations are considering filing a petition to the Kenyan courts in the hope of having their broadcasts restored by court order, he said. ""We are trying to resolve through dialogue, but if it doesn't work we will go to the courts,"" he said.
""It's shocking that the stations are still shut down,"" said Isaac Okero, president of the Law Society of Kenya. 
""This sets a very worrying tone for the country and really reveals to us that the state's supposed commitment to constitutional order is very brittle if there at all.""
The Media Council of Kenya said in a statement the closures were ""the greatest threat and assault on freedom of expression and media in Kenya’s recent history."" 
On Tuesday security forces made no move to stop an opposition gathering in downtown Nairobi attended by more than 15,000 people, which authorities had said would be illegal. 
But the government later declared the opposition ""National Resistance Movement"" a criminal group, paving the way for potential arrests. 

On Monday, Linus Kaikai, chairman of the Kenya Editors’ Guild, said editors had been warned by authorities that they could be shut down if they covered the event.

362,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 09:58AM ET</span>",Austria plans to dissolve fraternity in neo-Nazi scandal,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Wednesday the government planned to disband a fraternity over its anti-Semitic songbook, amid calls for a far-right politician to resign for having been the group's deputy leader.
Days before last Sunday's regional election in the province of Lower Austria, a weekly newspaper reported the songbook's contents, adding that its deputy leader was Udo Landbauer, the lead candidate for the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO), junior coalition partner to Kurz's conservatives in Vienna.
Landbauer suspended his membership in the Germania zu Wiener Neustadt fraternity soon afterwards but has refused to quit politics or his provincial assembly seat, despite calls for him to do so, including from President Alexander Van der Bellen.
Prosecutors have opened an investigation into four unspecified people under a law banning Holocaust denial and other Nazi-related offences. 
""I have agreed in the government and in particular with the interior minister that he will introduce a dissolution procedure against Germania,"" Kurz told reporters before a weekly cabinet meeting on Wednesday.
""I believe this is the right thing to do because where such a thing occurs there is not only individual responsibility, there is also collective responsibility."" 
But Interior Minister Herbert Kickl, who also hails from the FPO, said the fraternity would only be dissolved if investigations proved it had committed criminal acts.
""Mere suspicion does not suffice to justify the dissolution of the club,"" the Interior Ministry said in a statement, adding there was no limit to how long such an investigation might take.
Lyrics in the songbook joke about the extermination of Jews in gas chambers. Landbauer says he did not know of the anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi content, since the book was published in 1997, well before he joined, and he had only seen copies with those passages redacted or pages torn out.
The Freedom Party has stopped short of forcing him out, saying he had assured it he did nothing wrong.
In Austria, right-wing student fraternities sometimes espouse ideas with echoes of Nazism, like the concept of an expanded Germany including Austria.
About 40 percent of FPO members of parliament, several FPO ministers and numerous FPO ministry staff are members of such fraternities, according to Austria's main Jewish body IKG.
The Freedom Party was founded by former Nazis in the 1950s but says it has abandoned Nazi ideology. It rails against Islam but denounces anti-Semitism and courts Jewish voters, with limited success. 
The IKG has a policy of having no dealings with the Freedom Party or its ministers. It has also called on Landbauer to resign.
In a surprising twist, the Social Democrats (SPO) said they had expelled a member for having illustrated the same songbook after prosecutors placed him under investigation.

""The person was excluded from the provincial party leadership as well as the SPO,"" it said in a statement on Tuesday evening, without naming the individual.

A suicide bomber, Saudi-born Syrian Nabil Fadli, killed the tourists when he blew himself up in Sultanahmet, Istanbul's historic heart, on Jan. 12, 2016. Turkish authorities blamed Islamic State for the attack.
Two Syrians, Atala el-Hasan el-Mayyup and Fevzi Muhammed Ali, and a Turkish man, Halil Dervis, were found guilty of aiding murder, trying to overthrow the government and constitution, membership of a terrorist organization and committing crimes in the name of an armed terrorist organization.
They were each given 12 aggravated life sentences, 12 terms of 16 years and 16 eight-year terms for the injuries caused. They were also given nine years for transporting explosives from Syria, for a total of 329 years each on top of the multiple life sentences.
A lawyer for two of the convicted, Atanur Demir, said the investigation into the case was not thorough and that he would challenge the verdict.
""I am of the opinion that this verdict will be overturned by the appeals court,"" he said.
One other defendant received a six-year sentence for membership in a terrorist organization. Unlike the others, he was released pending appeal. Eighteen defendants were found not guilty and four others remain at large.
The bomber, Fadli, was born in Saudi Arabia in 1988 where his father was teaching. He fought in the ranks of Islamic State in Syria and was at one stage captured and tortured, before entering Turkey a few weeks before the attack, officials said.
Fadli registered as a refugee with authorities in Istanbul in early January, 2016, before blowing himself up among groups of tourists in Sultanahmet Square (NYSE:SQ) near the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, striking at the heart of Turkey's tourism industry.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court on Wednesday ordered the conditional release of the jailed chairman of Amnesty International in Turkey, the rights group said, although the trial will continue despite criticism from the European Union and the United States.
Taner Kilic has been in prison since June in the coastal province of Izmir on terrorism charges. Prosecutors say he downloaded ByLock, a messaging application used by supporters of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric blamed by Turkey for a failed military coup in 2016. Kilic denies the charges.
While Taner was released, the trial against him and 10 other human rights activists on terrorism-related charges continues.
""It is an enormous relief that Taner will soon be back with his wife and daughters, sleeping in his own bed for the first time in almost eight months. But we cannot forget that many other innocent people remain behind bars without a shred of evidence in Turkey,"" Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International’s Europe Director said.
""These unfounded prosecutions are an attempt to silence critical voices within Turkey but have only served to highlight the importance of human rights and those who dedicate their lives to defending them,"" Gulik added.
People in the courtroom greeted the decision with shouts of joy, and many friends and colleagues wept and hugged one another.
""At last justice has been served. We are very happy. Eight months is a long time for an innocent person. We hope to be acquitted in the end because we are not guilty,"" said Idil Eser, one of eight activists released in a hearing last October in the same case.
""Being a right activist is not a crime,"" added Eser, who is director of Amnesty International's local branch.
The case against the activists, who number 11 in total and who face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty, has become a flashpoint in Turkey's tense relations with the European Union, which it still aspires to join.
It has also heightened concerns that Turkey, an important NATO ally, is sliding further toward authoritarian rule under President Tayyip Erdogan.

365,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 09:21AM ET</span>",Leading lady of Italy's right campaigns for a baby boom,"By Isla Binnie
ROME (Reuters) - When a seven months-pregnant Giorgia Meloni put herself forward for the post of mayor of Rome in 2016, her ally Silvio Berlusconi told her that a mother could not do such a tough job.
She stood anyway and lost, partly because her conservative allies deserted her. 
Two years later, the pair have linked up in a center-right coalition to fight a national election on March 4, with Meloni insisting that their joint program include measures to help working mothers and encourage people to have children. 
Her party, the Brothers of Italy, which traces its roots to the post-Fascist Italian Social Movement, is a small but crucial component in the alliance that polls suggest will win the election, while probably falling short of a working majority.
""The first thing we asked for was a grand plan to sustain the birth rate and give incentives to become parents, which is a priority in our program,"" Meloni, the only woman to lead a high-profile party into the election, told Reuters in an interview. 
""Too many women have to choose between being a mother and having a job.""
Since becoming Italy's youngest ever minister 10 years ago, the 41-year-old has campaigned on a hard-right, nationalist platform with the credo ""Italians First"".
She says that if Italy's birth rate keeps on falling, in 30 years more than 35 percent of the population will be over 65 and the welfare system that underpins the euro zone's third-largest economy will not cope.
Campaigning for mayor while pregnant, Meloni felt ""if this kind of discrimination happens to someone like me, who has opportunity, and can get myself organized when I become a mother, imagine what happens to a girl on a short-term contract at a call center"".
Brothers of Italy, which polls at around 5 percent, is the junior partner in the center-right coalition with Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) and the far-right Northern League. 
Meloni's personal popularity dwarfs her party's, with an approval rating of over 20 percent putting her roughly in line with her coalition allies in some surveys.
A combative public speaker, Meloni's rapid-fire speeches attacking immigration and globalization are delivered in deep tones easily traceable to the working-class Rome neighborhood where she was born and raised.
She speaks proudly of her history in Italian right-wing politics, emphasizing she was born decades after the end of the country's wartime dictatorship. 
She says Italians must take precedence over immigrants for access to social services, like the free nursery care she proposes to help boost births, which declined by 100,000 between 2008 and 2016.
Meloni's policies are similar to those of League leader Matteo Salvini, but while the League's power base is in the industrial north, Brothers of Italy is stronger in the center and under-developed south - where it is proposing a dedicated investment plan with tax breaks for companies.
She and Salvini opposed legislation on gay civil unions and citizenship for children of immigrants, and they often attack the European Union. 
Their nationalist messages have worried financial markets and Brussels, and Berlusconi is responding by casting himself as a moderate who can keep his rambunctious allies in check.
He has promised to keep Italy in the euro, to which both Salvini and Meloni are hostile, and to keep Italy's budget deficit inside EU-imposed limits. But disagreements among the partners are frequent on these and other issues.
Meloni called the euro ""a currency that could collapse"", meaning Italy needs a ""plan B"", but should not exit unilaterally. 
""PATRIOTS""
If the center-right wins power, whichever party gets most votes will pick the premier, meaning Meloni is unlikely to be Italy's first female prime minister, but she expects her group to win more than 50 seats, up from its current tally of 12. 
As well as the parenting plan, which includes monthly bonuses for parents of children under six, Brothers of Italy wants Muslim religious services to be conducted in Italian not Arabic, and to limit the number of foreign pupils in schoolrooms. 
Born more than 30 years after the end of the Second World War, Meloni brushes off links with Italy's Fascist dictatorship, saying this is ""waved like a scarecrow"" by her opponents.
At least two European embassies in Rome would not welcome meetings with Meloni because of her party's extremist tendencies, officials said, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue so close to the election.
Meloni said she spoke to diplomats from ""all Italy's principal allies"", and had met ambassadors from the United States, Russia and Israel.
She says the center-left government copied her proposals with its plan to stop mass migration across the Mediterranean by supporting the Libyan coast guard. 
""They said we were xenophobes because we asked to strike a deal with the Libyan governments and called for a naval blockade on the Libyan coast to stop the boats, then when the interior minister said it, he was treated like a genius."" 
She admits the center-right allies argue, describing their relationship as ""up and down"", but she says they have a responsibility to bury their differences. 

""We are the only ones able to give Italy a government of patriots, that looks after the interests of Italians.""

Grana said late on Tuesday that a judge had summoned it to a Feb 16 hearing regarding the prosecutors' request to include it and other units in the Grana y Montero Group as ""investigated subjects"" in the far-reaching graft probe.
Grana rejected the notion that any of the Grana companies should be targeted. ""These companies are not organizations designed to corrupt officials...on the contrary, we are an organization with no room for irregular practices or fraud,"" the company said in a statement.
Grana has been hit by a series of setbacks that have sunk its share price since late 2016, when its partner Odebrecht acknowledged paying local officials $29 million in bribes to secure lucrative construction contracts.
As Grana has been paying down debt stemming from the cancellation of a pipeline project it was building with Odebrecht, its former executives have been placed under pre-trial arrest and prosecutors have raided its offices.
Grana reiterated on Tuesday that it had no knowledge that any of its employees or former employees took part in corruption and said it was willing to collaborate with probes by public prosecutors.
It was not clear what the immediate impact might be if Grana were formally placed under investigation.
Under an anti-graft law passed last year, companies that have acknowledged or been found guilty of corruption cannot bid on new government contracts and must comply with a series of financial restrictions.
Critics say the law has discouraged other companies from offering prosecutors details of potential corruption and the government of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has said it plans to replace it ahead of its expiration next month.
The opposition-controlled Congress passed legislation last year to expand the law to include Odebrecht's partners, but the prime minister signaled Kuczynski would not sign off on it.
Judge Richard Concepcion, who has approved prosecutors' requests to order the pre-trial detention of corruption suspects, summoned Grana to the Feb 16 hearing, Grana said.
Last year, lead prosecutor Hamilton Castro accused Odebrecht of paying a $20 million bribe to former president Alejandro Toledo. Toledo, who is in the United States and is wanted for arrest in Peru, denies the charges.

The perpetrators were each fined 500 Egyptian pounds ($28) on charges of inciting sectarian strife, harming national unity and vandalizing private property. They can appeal.
The Giza misdemeanor court also fined the owner of the building, a Christian man, 360,000 Egyptian pounds ($20,500) for turning his residency into a church without a license. 
Dozens of Muslims from the village of Kafr al-Waslin attacked the church after Friday prayers on Dec. 22, smashing windows and breaking everything inside.
The Archdiocese of Atfih had applied to legalize the church, which housed worshippers for 15 years after a church building law was passed in 2016.
Christians in Egypt have long complained of discrimination in the majority-Muslim country and have increasingly come under attack in recent years. 
Egyptian authorities are also battling a stubborn Islamist insurgency, mostly concentrated in the remote Sinai Peninsula, which has claimed several attacks on Egypt's large Christian minority.

Duterte's office on Monday ordered the 90-day suspension of the deputy, Melchor Arthur Carandang, after he revealed confidential information last September about the agency's inquiry into the unexplained wealth of the president.
Conchita Carpio-Morales expressed ""concern"" over the order, describing it as ""an impairment of the constitutionally enshrined independence"" of the agency.
""The ombudsman cannot seriously place at risk the independence of the very office which she has pledged to protect, on the strength of the constitutional guarantees which the High Court has upheld,"" she said in a statement.
Duterte has threatened to file an impeachment complaint against Carpio-Morales after her office launched an inquiry into allegations that he had billions of pesos in undeclared funds in bank accounts.
Last year, Carandang revealed to the media Duterte's bank accounts, which showed discrepancies with his official statement of assets, liabilities and net worth, a potential violation of the law.
The inquiry followed a complaint by Senator Antonio Trillanes that Duterte had amassed 2.2 billion pesos ($43 million) in three bank accounts between 2006 and 2015, when he was mayor of the southern city of Davao, committing a criminal offence by failing to include them in an official declaration.
Duterte has denied the allegations.
A lawyer for Duterte, Salvador Panelo, said Carpio-Morales must comply with the order or risk facing administrative and criminal sanctions.
""Until a competent court declares that such official act is in violation of the law and the constitution, President Rodrigo Duterte's order of preventive suspension for office of Deputy Ombudsmaan Carangdang is presumed to be valid and legal,"" Panelo told reporters.
The firebrand leader won the presidency in May 2016 on the platform of fighting corruption, crime and drugs. He has fired a cabinet member and a dozen senior officials over allegations of corruption, but no cases have been filed against them.

369,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 07:54AM ET</span>","Taliban active in 70 percent of Afghanistan, BBC study finds","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Taliban are openly active in 70 percent of Afghanistan's districts, fully controlling 4 percent of the country and demonstrating an open physical presence in another 66 percent, according to a BBC study published on Tuesday.
The BBC estimate, which it said was based on conversations with more than 1,200 individual sources in all districts of the South Asian country, was significantly higher than the most recent assessment by the NATO-led coalition. 
The coalition said on Tuesday that the Taliban contested or controlled only 44 percent of Afghan districts as of October 2017. 
Afghanistan has been reeling over the past nine days from a renewed spate of violence that is adding scrutiny to the latest, more aggressive U.S.-backed strategy to bolster Afghan forces battling the Taliban in a 16-year-old war.
A bomb hidden in an ambulance struck the city center and killed more than 100 people, just over a week after an attack on the Hotel Intercontinental, also in Kabul, which left more than 20 people dead, including four U.S. citizens.
The BBC counted 399 districts in Afghanistan, but the NATO-led force counted 407. The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear.
The BBC study said the Afghan government controlled 122 districts, or about 30 percent of the country. Still, it noted, that did not mean that they were free from Taliban attacks. 
""Kabul and other major cities, for example, suffered major attacks - launched from adjacent areas, or by sleeper cells - during the research period, as well as before and after,"" the report said.
Asked about the BBC's study, the Pentagon did not comment directly, but pointed to the latest figures by the NATO-led coalition asserting that about 56 percent of Afghanistan's territory was under Afghan government control or influence.
Captain Thomas Gresback, a spokesman for the coalition in Kabul, said the BBC estimate overstated the militants' ""influence impact"".
""This is a criminal network, not a government in waiting,"" Gresback said in an emailed statement.
""What really matters is not the number of districts held, but population controlled. RS assesses that around 12 percent of the population is actually under full Taliban control,"" he said, referring to the Resolute Support mission.
The study by Britain's public broadcaster quoted a spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani playing down the findings.

The BBC study also said Islamic State had a presence in 30 districts, but noted it did not fully control any of them.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 07:51AM ET</span>",Pakistan recommends five-month extension for Afghan refugees,"By Asif Shahzad
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani government ministry recommended on Wednesday that Afghan refugees be given a five-month extension of their stay, dispelling fears that a large-scale repatriation back to violence-plagued Afghanistan was imminent.
Pakistan is home to the world's second-largest refugee population, with a total of 2.5 million Afghans, many of whom been living there since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.
But relations between the neighbors have deteriorated in recent years and took another turn for the worse this week after bloody Taliban attacks in Kabul.
Afghanistan and the United States say Taliban and other militants plot carnage in safe havens on the Pakistani side of the border and have repeatedly called on Pakistan to do more to rein them in.
The tense relations led to concern that Pakistan might retaliate by pushing back Afghan refugees, particularly since official permission to stay was only extended for 30 days at the beginning of this month.
But a spokesman for Pakistan's Ministry of States and Frontier Regions said it had decided that permission to stay should be extended for another five months.
""The main reason for the extension is that it isn't possible humanly to ask over one million people to leave at once,"" the spokesman, Aqdas Shaukat, told Reuters.
""Our understanding is that another five months will give the refugees a good time to leave gradually.""
The cabinet would decide on the recommendation next week, he said.
Pakistan complains that the large number of refugees are a burden, and says that Islamist militants often hide among them, but humanitarian agencies say Afghanistan could not cope with an influx of repatriated refugees at this time.
It is already struggling to help those refugees who have come back over recent years as well people displaced internally by fighting.
In 2017, fighting forced 360,000 people from their homes, the United Nations said in a recent report, while more than 17,000 people were displaced over the past week, the U.N. Organisation for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Assistance said.
On the outskirts of Kabul, refugees who have come back from Pakistan and internally displaced people eke out a living on a windswept, muddy plain and wait for help.
""We returned from Pakistan and have nothing here,"" said one woman called Shazia, who came back three years ago. 
""Our children collect plastic and paper to keep us warm.""
Another returnee from Pakistan, Etibar Gul, also worried about his children.

""There is no food or clothing,"" he said. ""Our children have nothing to wear in this cold.""

Landlocked and impoverished Laos shares a border with Vietnam and Thailand, an important ""Golden Triangle"" smuggling hub for narcotics and the chemicals that make them.
Hong Kong-based Kings Romans International (HK) Co. Ltd. controls a 102-sq-km (39-sq-mile) special economic zone which occupies seven km (four miles) of prime Mekong riverbank overlooking Myanmar and Thailand.
The company, which has a 99-year land lease from the government, allows visitors to openly buy endangered species products, including tigers and bears smuggled in from Asia and Africa, according to the British-based Environmental Investigation Agency. 
In a statement posted on Tuesday, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) identified and targeted four key individuals, including casino owner Zhao Wei, who were part of a network that engaged in ""horrendous illicit activities"", it said.
The network stretched from Kings Romans ""throughout Southeast Asia"", said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, in the statement.
""OFAC is designating the Zhao Wei network as part of a broader strategy to disrupt the financial infrastructure of transnational criminal organizations that pose a threat to the United States and our allies.""
The sanctions aim to destabilize the narcotics trade in the Mekong area at a time of growing Chinese influence in the region.
Chinese businessmen flock daily to the special economic zone, with a Reuters report stating that the area was so large and strategically located that some fear it might one day be used as a Chinese outpost.
Operating via the Kings Romans Casino, the Zhao Wei network allowed the storage and distribution of heroin and other narcotics, the statement said. Since 2014, Thai, Lao, and Chinese authorities had seized large narcotics shipments that have been traced to Kings Romans, the statement said.
Chinese national Zhao is the co-owner and director of Kings Romans International. 
Zhao, who was not able to be reached for comment, is also the defacto chairman of Laos Golden Triangle special economic zone, the U.S. government said. 
Chinese national Guiqin Su, Zhao's wife, an Australian and a Thai national were also named as targets of the sanctions. None was reachable for comment. 
All assets from Zhao's network under U.S. jurisdiction have been frozen and Americans are prohibited from engaging in transactions with it, the statement said.
Paul Bromberg, the chief executive of Spectrum Asia, a Bangkok-based consultancy firm, said the sanctions were unlikely to hit Zhao's network in the near term.

""In the long term, this is a good thing for Laos. It could give the government some kind of impetus to improve the regulation of their gaming industry. For now, I think Kings Roman would probably stay in operation.""

Cameroon has been fighting Anglophone separatists who have taken up arms over the past year in an attempt to create a nation which they call Ambazonia. The insurgency represents the gravest challenge yet to the 35-year rule of Cameroon's President Paul Biya.
More than 43,000 Cameroonians have fled as refugees to Nigeria to escape the government crackdown on the separatists, say local aid officials. The majority are in Nigeria's Cross River state, which borders southwest Cameroon. 
A spokesman for Nigeria's civil defense agency in Cross River state said Cameroonian gendarmes crossed into Danare, a border community in the Boki local government area of Cross River state, on Tuesday. He said they harassed Cameroonian refugees and their Nigerian hosts. 
""The gendarmes came in briefly, harassed the people and left immediately. They have been doing this since the crisis of agitation for independence forced these refugees to flee Cameroon and come into Nigeria,"" said Solomon Eremi, a spokesman for the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). 
A former councilor in Boki, Douglas Ogar, also said Cameroonian gendarmes had entered the community. ""The gendarmes are so emboldened as they have shown outright defiance to Nigeria's territorial sovereignty,"" he said. 
Cameroonian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
It is not the first incursion by Cameroonian gendarmes. At least one such move was carried out by troops last month.
Last week, a Cameroonian separatist leader arrested in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, was deported. 
The linguistic divide in Cameroon - a mostly Francophone country - harks back to the end of World War One when the German colony of Kamerun was carved up between allied French and British victors.
The English-speaking regions joined the French-speaking Republic of Cameroon the year after its independence in 1960. French speakers have dominated the country's politics since.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Steinhoff has reported its former chief executive Markus Jooste to South Africa's elite Hawks police unit over suspected corruption, its acting chairwoman told a parliamentary committee hearing on Wednesday.
The South African retailer, whose more than 40 brands include Britain's Poundland, revealed accounting irregularities in December, causing an 85 percent fall in its share price that wiped more than $10 billion off its market value.
It has since been scrambling to sell assets and find short-term funds to avoid parts of its business pulling down the sprawling retail empire which became one of the world's largest household goods retailers.
""Based on our investigations to date, we have reported the former CEO Markus Jooste to the Hawks ... The matter is now in the hands of the Hawks for investigation and prosecution,"" Steinhoff's acting chairwoman Heather Sonn told the committee, citing the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Practices Act. 
Jooste, who oversaw the company's rapid expansion over almost two decades, resigned on Dec. 5 as the accounting scandal broke. The former CEO has not made a public statement since and could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday.
""We don't know at this stage if the crisis could have been prevented,"" Sonn told the joint finance, public accounts and public service administration committee that was called to get preliminary information on Steinhoff.
She said the company was committed to fixing what went wrong and that it was co-operating fully with all regulators.
The Hawks - whose full name is the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation - is responsible for investigating national criminal priorities such as serious organized and commercial crimes and serious corruption.
Hangwani Mulaudzi, the Hawks spokesman, told Reuters the unit opened a case to investigate Steinhoff in December and has sought the help of Interpol in its inquiry.
""No one is in custody, no one has reported to the Hawks, and we have not yet visited the offices to look at the company's computers or books. We have a case plan, a schedule and we will go step-by-step, this is a complicated case,"" he said.
""We have written to Interpol seeking assistance in investigating Steinhoff's activities abroad,"" Maulaudzi said.
Steinhoff shares fell around 2 percent as the hearing was taking place.
""ABSOLUTE TURMOIL""
Steinhoff officials said that retention of jobs, including 50,000 in South Africa, was one of the company's key aims.
Steinhoff's former chairman and leading shareholder Christo Wiese, who also spoke at the hearing, said the scandal ""came like a bolt from the blue"". Wiese said he became aware of problems at Steinhoff three working days before the company's accounts had to finalised for a board meeting in December. He said Steinhoff was in ""absolute turmoil"" at the time ""when this bomb exploded"", adding he ""understood people's anger"".
South Africa's Financial Services Board (FSB) said it was investigating two cases of possible insider trading and one of false or misleading statements relating to Steinhoff, while the Johannesburg Stock Exchange said it was still far from uncovering what had happened.
Meanwhile, South Africa's central bank said it was investigating whether Steinhoff had breached any exchange control laws or regulations. Were Steinhoff to collapse, it would not result in financial instability, the bank added.

ADEN (Reuters) - Three days of deadly clashes between southern Yemeni separatists and an internationally recognized government based in the port of Aden subsided on Wednesday after fighters handed back two military bases they had seized, residents said.
The detente followed mediation by a Saudi-led military coalition, which is trying to halt the worst infighting yet among its allies in a wider war against the Houthi movement that controls northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.
The separatists aim to restore the independent state of Southern Yemen, which united with northern Yemen in 1990. They have fought alongside forces of the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi, but rose up this week and seized control of Aden after Hadi refused to sack his prime minister.
The Aden-based government and the separatists are both allies of the Saudi-led coalition, although the separatists are seen as friendlier with the United Arab Emirates while Hadi's main patron is Saudi Arabia, where he lives in exile.
Separatist military units gained full control of Aden on Tuesday with the exception of a fortified presidential palace housing the prime minister's cabinet. But the fighters ceded two bases later on Tuesday.
""Government institutions were handed back and the (southern) militias withdrew,"" a government source told Reuters.
Residents reported that banks and businesses reopened on Wednesday as traffic resumed on the streets after many people spent days indoors fleeing from combat which killed at least 20 fighters. 
The separatist leader Aidaroos al-Zubaidi, speaking on Tuesday to France 24 Arabic TV, said his side remained loyal to Hadi and had no plans to quit the battle against the Houthis.
""We've asked the president ... to fire the government and appoint a caretaker government in its place,"" Zubaidi said. ""We ask the Arab coalition to take control and assume its duty to this people and these bad conditions.""
The conflict has pushed Yemen, already one of the Arab world's poorest countries, toward humanitarian collapse as hunger and disease spread.
The U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Wednesday that the latest fighting had hindered access to people in need.

""UNHCR emergency aid distributions and humanitarian assessments planned this week for vulnerable, displaced Yemenis have now been postponed and UNHCR humanitarian cargo remains at Aden port unable to be released,"" the group said.

Thailand's lese-majeste law is the world's toughest, and those judged guilty of breaking it face up to 15 years in jail for each count of offending the king, queen, heir or regent.
The six, aged between 18 and 20, were also found guilty of arson that damaged public property, as well as of organized crime, their lawyer, Pattana Saiyai, said.
""All of them confessed that they had no ill-intention, but were hired to go set fire to the royal portraits,"" Pattana told Reuters, adding that the court took into account the lack of intent in reducing their jail terms.
One of the six was jailed for 11-1/2 years, while three got terms of seven years and eight months each. Two 18-year-olds who set fire to only one portrait were jailed for three years and four months each.
The lawyer said police arrested two men in December over allegations that they paid his clients to set fire to the portraits, but the two have not yet been prosecuted.
Thailand's military, which took control of the government in a May 2014 coup, has said it needs to crack down on critics of the monarchy for the sake of national security. 
Since the coup, at least 94 people have been prosecuted for lese majeste. As many as 43 people have been sentenced, says the iLaw group that monitors royal insult case, with 92 percent pleading guilty in hopes of shorter jail terms.
The laws protecting members of the royal family from insult limit what all news organizations, including Reuters, can report from Thailand.
The United Nations has expressed concern over what it calls a deteriorating rights situation in Thailand, including harsh sentences for those convicted of violating the lese-majeste law, known as Article 112.

LONDON (Reuters) - An Iranian-American dual citizen and his wife have been sentenced to 27 and 16 years in jail respectively, the husband said in a letter from prison published on human rights websites.
Karan Vafadari, a U.S. citizen, and Afarin Neyssari, a U.S. permanent resident, were arrested in July 2016. They own an art gallery, and they were first accused of hosting mixed-gender parties for foreign diplomats and possessing alcoholic drinks at home. 
However, they later faced more serious charges, including ""espionage"", ""attempt to overthrow the regime"" and ""conferring to conspire against national security"", their family said in a petition in 2017.
In a letter from Evin Prison published on Tuesday by the Center for Human Rights in Iran, Vafadari said the couple were sentenced last week by a Revolutionary Court in Tehran, but the ""baseless security accusations"" had been dropped. He called the verdict ""unjust and tyrannical"".
It was not clear what charges the couple were convicted of. Iran's judiciary was not immediately available for comment.
The couple will have 21 days to appeal the verdict.
Vafadari belongs to the Zoroastrian faith, a religious minority in Iran whose members are allowed to drink liquor discreetly in the privacy of their homes.
Vafadari said he has been targeted by the Revolutionary Guards intelligence agency for his ""international activities"" in the art world, and his dual nationality.
""It means my wife and me, and every one of you dual national Zoroastrians who returned to your country to invest in the homeland you love, are always going to be in danger of losing your assets and being forced to leave the country.""
Iran does not recognize dual nationality, a position that prevents Western embassy officials from visiting such detainees. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have arrested at least 30 dual nationals since 2015, mostly on spying charges, Reuters reported in November.

The police said they arrested a Turk, aged 44, a 37-year old Pole and a Bulgarian, 53, in raids on seven properties in Berlin, Bremen, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony.
Investigators believe the traffickers smuggled at least 160 migrants into Germany in the summer and autumn of 2017, hiding some of them in trucks behind goods and pallets, police said.
Immigration remains a politically charged issue in Germany after Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to open the doors to more than one million migrants and refugees in 2015 and 2016.
The traffickers demanded 8,000 euros ($9,950) per migrant and brought most of them into Germany via Poland or the Czech Republic after coming north from the Balkans, police said.
""The investigations in this case show once again that unscrupulous traffickers are only concerned about profit,"" Joerg Baumbach, federal police head in Pirna, said in a statement.
""They do not care about the well-being of those who entrust themselves to them for a lot of money.""

The Datafolha survey published on Wednesday in the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper shows that if Lula cannot run, right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro would take the lead and make it to the second round. 
The poll showed that Bolsonaro would lose badly in a second-round vote to environmentalist and two-time presidential hopeful Marina Silva, and be in a second-round dead heat with likely center-right candidate Geraldo Alckmin, the governor of Sao Paulo state.
If Lula is not allowed to run by the courts, a record 32 percent of Brazilians polled by Datafolha said they would vote for no one in the presidential race.
Showing widespread contempt for a political class engulfed by kickback scandals since 2014, while Lula leads in the polls, he also has by far the highest rejection rate among voters, at 40 percent.
LULA RUNS 
The survey showed that Lula, as the former president is known, would receive 34 percent of the first-round vote if he can run, compared with 16 percent for right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro and 8 percent for Marina Silva.
The poll also indicated that Lula would beat all other likely candidates in a second-round runoff race, required if no single candidate wins a majority of the vote in the first round.
If Lula does not run, Bolsonaro would get 18 percent of first-round vote while Marina Silva would get 13 percent and Gomes 10 percent. TV presenter Luciano Huck and Alckmin would each get 8 percent of the votes without Lula.
The Datafolha interviews were conducted on Jan. 29-30, a few days after three appellate court judges voted to uphold Lula's convictions on taking bribes and money laundering. 
Lula, Brazil's first working-class leader, held office from 2003 to 2010. He remains free pending future appeals.

Datafolha interviewed 2,826 people across Brazil. The margin of error is two percentage points.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's domestic intelligence chief wants the government to review laws restricting the surveillance of minors to guard against the children of Islamist fighters returning to the country as ""sleeper agents"" who could carry out attacks.
Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the BfV agency, told Reuters that security officials were preparing for the return of Islamic State fighters to Germany along with potentially ""brainwashed"" children, although no big wave appeared imminent.
Nearly 1,000 people are believed to have left Germany to join up with the Islamist militants. As the group's presence in the Middle East crumbles, some are returning with family members.
Only a small number of the 290 toddlers and children who left Germany or were born in Syria and Iraq had returned thus far, Maassen said. Many were likely to still be in the region, or perhaps moving to areas such as Afghanistan, where Islamic State remains strong.
He said Germany should review laws restricting surveillance of minors under the age of 14 to prepare for the increased risk of attacks by children as young as nine who grew up in Islamic State schools.
""We see that children who grew up with Islamic State were brainwashed in the schools and the kindergartens of the IS,"" he said. ""They were confronted early with the IS ideology ... learned to fight, and were in some cases forced to participate in the abuse of prisoners, or even the killing of prisoners.""
He said security officials believed such children could later carry out violent attacks in Germany.
""We have to consider that these children could be living time bombs,"" he said. ""There is a danger that these children come back brainwashed with a mission to carry out attacks.""
Maassen's comments were the first specific estimate of the number of children affected, following his initial warning in October that such children could pose a threat after being indoctrinated in battlefield areas.
The radicalization of minors has been a big topic in Germany given that three of five Islamist attacks in Germany in 2016 were carried out by minors, and a 12-year-old boy was also detained after trying to bomb a Christmas market in Ludwigshafen.
The German government says it has evidence that more than 960 people left Germany for Iraq and Syria through November 2017 to fight for the Islamic State jihadist group, of which about a third are believed to have returned to Germany. Another 150 likely died in combat, according to government data.
Maassen said Islamic State also continued to target vulnerable youths in Germany through the Internet and social media, often providing slick advertising or age-appropriate propaganda to recruit them to join the jihadist group.
""Islamic State uses headhunters who scour the Internet for children that can be approached and tries to radicalize these children, or recruit these children for terrorist attacks,"" he said.

Turkey last week launched an air and ground offensive in northwest Syria, targeting the Kurdish YPG militia in the Afrin region. That has opened a new front in the seven-year-old civil war and strained ties with Turkey's NATO allies.
""If it turns out that this operation takes a turn other than to fight a potential terrorist threat to the Turkish border and becomes an invasion operation, (then) this becomes a real problem for us,"" Macon said in an interview with Le Figaro newspaper published on Wednesday. 
Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist organization and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade-long insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast. 
Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim defended the operation saying it was solely aimed at securing his country's security and protecting Arabs, Kurds and Turkmens from ""terrorist organizations.""
""If France is interpreting this issue as such (invasion operation), we need to assess what they have done in Syria accordingly,"" Yildirum said at a news conference alongside Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri in Ankara.
""This is a crooked idea from the start. The whole world knows that Turkey is not acting with an invasive mind. They should know it.""
The United States and France have armed and trained YPG-led militia in the fight against Islamic State in Syria.

Macron said he would bring the issue up again with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and that the nature of the operation meant there should be discussions between Europeans, but also more widely among allies.

NEW DELHI/PORT VICTORIA (Reuters) - India has signed a 20-year pact with the Seychelles to build an airstrip and a jetty for its navy in the island chain, the two countries said, as the South Asian nation steps up a contest with China for influence in the Indian Ocean.
China last year inaugurated its first overseas military base in Djibouti, near one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, deepening Indian insecurities and pushing it to gain a foothold in the region.
The agreement signed in the Seychelles' capital of Victoria last weekend provides for India to develop the airstrip and jetty on the Assumption islands, near another shipping route. 
""India is helping us free of charge, and the facilities and activities will entirely be at the control of Seychelles and will be conducted as per the laws of Seychelles,"" Barry Faure, its secretary of state for foreign affairs, told Reuters.
But nothing had been leased to India and the new facilities would help Seychelles better control its exclusive economic zone of 1.3 million square kilometers, Faure added.
First announced during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's trip to the islands in 2015, the pact faced problems, as critics who feared a handover of territory demanded that the Seychelles government make clear the terms of India's role.
But those concerns have since been tackled, officials said.
India and Seychelles are maritime neighbors with a stake in each other’s security, said Indian Foreign Secretary Subrahmaniam Jaishankar, who signed the agreement in his last official action before retiring this week. 
""India and Seychelles have drawn up a cooperation agenda that covers joint efforts in anti-piracy operations, and enhanced surveillance and monitoring to prevent intrusions by potential economic offenders,"" he said.
These are people engaged in illegal fishing, poaching, drug and human trafficking, he added.
China has been building ports, power stations and highways across Asia, but the terms of some of its investments have angered people. 
In Sri Lanka, China faced criticism after taking control of the southern port of Hambantota it had built in a debt-to-equity swap deal.
India has tried to be more careful, avoiding giving hard loans and casting its assistance as a joint endeavor. 
But military officials called the Seychelles pact a big step in extending the reach of India's navy, which is expected to rotate its ships and aircraft through the islands.
""The development is a clear indicator that India's geo-strategic frontier is expanding in tandem with China's growing strategic footprint in the Indo-Pacific,"" said Captain Gurpreet Khurana of the Indian Navy's National Maritime Foundation.

The ruling is the latest in a series of scores of harsh penalties in the Western-allied Gulf kingdom for defendants accused of Iranian-backed militancy but who activists say are mostly peaceful opposition members.
Alleging they were part of a terrorist cell trained in the use of heavy weapons and explosives, the court jailed 19 for life and 37 for terms up to 15 years.
Two defendants were acquitted.
Bahrain accuses mainly Shi'ite Iran of stoking militancy in the kingdom, which Tehran denies. Bahrain, a strategic island where the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet is based, has a Shi'ite Muslim majority population but is ruled by a Sunni royal family.
Bahrain has seen occasional unrest since 2011 when authorities crushed protests mainly by the Shi'ite community demanding a bigger role in running the country.
A London-based Bahraini activist rights group, the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD), condemned the ruling. 
""Today's ruling is the latest episode in Bahrain's travesty of justice, and likely one of the most cruel. The authorities have further proved their willingness to exploit the vulnerability of its citizens,"" Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of advocacy at BIRD, said in a statement.

Washington has shifted away millions of dollars in funding for law enforcement from a drug control program of the Philippine National Police since the bloody anti-narcotics campaign started in July 2016.
But there are positive signs and the United States remains supportive of the Philippines' effort to battle illicit drugs, said James Walsh, a deputy assistant state secretary in the international narcotics and law enforcement bureau.
""I would describe the United States as being cautiously optimistic,"" Walsh told a telephonic news conference late on Tuesday.
""Many folks have been tracking the extrajudicial killings in the Philippines and the trends are going down, so there is some encouragement that we are seeing in some of our human rights training working."" 
Nearly 4,000 people have been killed in shootouts with the police in raids and sting operations since Duterte came to power in July 2016, government data shows. But human rights groups put the figure higher, accusing police of executing drug users and peddlers in cold blood.
On Wednesday, Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque, said there were no ""extrajudicial killings"" in the war on drugs.
But he welcomed the comments as a reflection of Washington's growing appreciation of the campaign's benefits.
""These efforts are anchored on respect for human rights, cognizant of our obligation to protect our people’s right to life and to live in peace and security,"" Roque said in a statement.
Police resumed their anti-drug campaign on Monday with visits to the homes of users and dealers to convince them to surrender, and police chief Ronald dela Rosa offered an assurance it would be free of violence.
Dela Rosa there were no deaths reported in the first 24 hours after operations resumed. 
Walsh also said Washington has been cooperating with Cambodia, China, Indonesia and the Philippines and has seen traffickers now use bitcoin to flood the U.S. market with synthetic drugs from China and Mexico.

But he gave no details of the use of virtual currencies in the narcotics trade.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Afghanistan's intelligence chief visited Pakistan on Wednesday, officials said, at a time when tension between the neighbors is simmering over accusations that Pakistan offers a safe haven for Taliban militants. 
The visit comes amid anger in Afghanistan over an attack on a luxury hotel and a car bomb in the capital, Kabul, that killed more than 120 people, which the government has blamed on Haqqani network militants believed to operate out of Pakistan. 
The Afghan team will present documentary evidence and phone tap information linking individuals and groups based in Pakistan with the Kabul attacks, a senior Afghan military source told Reuters. 
The delegation includes Masoom Stanekzai, head of the National Directorate for Security intelligence agency, and Afghan Interior Minister Wais Barmak, officials said.
""The Afghan government had requested that a high-level delegation would like to visit Pakistan with a message from the Afghan president,"" Pakistan's foreign office spokesman, Mohammad Faisal, said in a Twitter message. 
On Saturday, a vehicle painted as an ambulance exploded in a Taliban suicide attack in one of the most well-protected parts of Kabul, killing more than 100 people and wounding at least 235.
It followed a Taliban-claimed attack a week earlier that killed more than 20 people in a siege of the city's Intercontinental Hotel.
Ties between the United States and Pakistan are brittle after Washington announced plans this month to suspend up to roughly $2 billion in U.S. security assistance.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that Pakistan had rewarded past U.S. aid with ""nothing but lies & deceit"".
Pakistan, which denies the accusations it allows safe havens for militants, condemned Saturday's attack and accused Washington of betrayal.
Pakistan is widely blamed in Kabul for the attacks and a senior Afghanistan cleric this week criticized a fatwa against suicide attacks issued by Pakistani religious authorities for not explicitly declaring attacks in Afghanistan haram, or unlawful for Muslims.
Pakistan's embassy in Kabul rejected the criticism, saying in a statement the fatwa was a message against violence and terrorism anywhere in the name of Islamic injunctions.
In November, Pakistan handed to Afghanistan 27 people suspected of belonging to the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network, a spokesman for the country's foreign office said on Monday.
A delegation from Islamabad is to visit Afghanistan on Feb. 3, Pakistan's embassy in Kabul said. 
""The delegation, led by the foreign secretary, will hold constructive and meaningful discussions with Afghanistan on all issues including counter-terrorism, peace and reconciliation and repatriation of refugees,"" the embassy said in a statement.

Since military rule began in Thailand in 2014, demonstrations have become a rarity, partly because of orders by the junta banning the public assembly of five or more people.
The eight charged on Wednesday, who belong to the People Go Network of activists and academics, which organized the anti-junta ""We Walk"" march lasting until Feb. 17, have denied the charge.
""We think in the past three years, the junta hasn't been genuine and hasn't listened to the people,"" said the group's coordinator, Supaporn Malailoy.
""So we march with our friends, with the civil liberties we have."" 
Responding to the comment, junta spokesman Winthai Suvaree said, ""That is just the personal opinion of some people who are already prejudiced."" 
The eight are to report to a state prosecutor on Feb. 26, who will decide whether to take the case to court, the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights group said.
Wednesday's prosecution was an ""infringement of fundamental rights and freedoms,"" 52 civil rights groups said. 
""The royal police of Thailand and the government have done some wrongs in violation of these fundamental values, principles and human rights,"" they said in a joint statement. 
""These actions need to be condemned.""
The ban on public gatherings was inconsistent with Thailand's international human rights obligations, the International Commission of Jurists said.
""Thailand should immediately end the criminal proceedings,"" said Kingsley Abbott, its senior international legal adviser. 
The 450-km (280-mile) march from Bangkok, the capital, to the northeastern province of Khon Kaen, has drawn participants from civil rights groups concerned about healthcare, alternative farming, natural resources and freedom of expression. 
It aims to spotlight growing public frustration with the junta, which has delayed a promised return to democracy, reined in free speech, cracked down on dissent, and pursued projects despite opposition from rights groups and local communities. 
Democracy activists were among more than 100 people who gathered on Saturday to protest against the military government and show support for the People Go Network.
The United Nations has also expressed concern over what it calls a deteriorating rights situation in Thailand, including harsh sentences for those convicted of violating the lese-majeste law, as well as other curbs on free expression.

YANGON (Reuters) - A Myanmar official who was the administrator of a town in troubled Rakhine state when seven people died there in rioting earlier this month has been stabbed and killed, the government said on Wednesday.
Police were treating the death of Bo Bo Min Theik as a case of personal enmity and it was not related to the violence in the region, said Zaw Htay, a government spokesman.
His body was found in his car on the highway from Mrauk U to the provincial capital Sittwe on Tuesday, district officials said.
Bo Bo Min Theik was replaced as the administrator of Mrauk U and posted to the provincial government in Sittwe three days after police shot and killed seven demonstrators from the majority Buddhist community after a local gathering celebrating an ancient Buddhist Arakan kingdom turned violent.
The violence underscores the challenges facing Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a country where dozens of ethnic groups have been clamoring for autonomy since independence from Britain in 1947.
Tensions in Rakhine, previously called Arakan, have surged since a sweeping Myanmar army operation in August inflamed communal tension and triggered an exodus of over 688,000 minority Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh, according to the United Nations.
The military has set up over 30 militias in the areas of Rakhine where many Rohingya lived and has provided arms to three of them, Myanmar's parliament was told on Tuesday.
Deputy Minister for Home Affairs Major-General Aung Soe told a parliamentary session that the militias were set up in the Maungdaw district of Rakhine. The Myanmar military launched a crackdown after Rohingya militants attacked security posts in Maungdaw on Aug. 25, leading to the exodus.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China rebuffed Taiwan's objections in a deepening row over the opening of new flight paths in the Taiwan Strait, saying on Wednesday that the space separating routes over the waterway was more than is mandated by international standards.
This month China opened several new air routes, including a northbound route up the sensitive Taiwan Strait that divides China from the island. Taiwan says it was done without its agreement, contravening what the democratic government in Taipei has said was a 2015 deal to first discuss such flight paths.
In response, self-governed Taiwan has withheld approval of routine applications from China Eastern and Xiamen Airlines, majority owned by China Southern Airlines, to add Lunar New Year flights because the airlines had used the disputed air routes.
Taiwan has expressed concern the new routes are too close to existing routes that link it to airports on two groups of Taiwan-controlled islands lying close to China - Kinmen which sits opposite to the Chinese city of Xiamen and the Matsu archipelago near to Fuzhou.
Multiple daily flights connect the islands to mainland Taiwan, while Xiamen and Fuzhou are also busy airports.
Speaking at a regular news briefing, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said there was at least 23 km (14 miles) separating the routes.
""This type of separation far exceeds lateral separation standards in the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organization,"" Ma said. ""So it can be said that the connecting routes are safe.""
Kinmen and Matsu have both been under Taiwan's control since defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. 
Frequently shelled by the Chinese during the height of the Cold War, both are now popular tourist destinations and connected to China by ferry.
Kinmen's airport is the busiest, with regular though less frequent flights to Matsu's two airports from Taiwan.
Despite the spat, air traffic controllers from both China and Taiwan continue to communicate and coordinate as normal, Wang Zhiqing, a deputy head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China told a separate briefing.
""Yesterday I met a relevant official from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and he said the M503 route has been assessed and approved of by them, it's safe and reliable,"" Wang said, referring to the main disputed route.
The ICAO did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment
A spokesman for airline lobby International Air Transport Association (IATA) said in an email to Reuters that it welcomed initiatives to improve the safety and efficiency of flight operations, including M503 and the new routes. 
It added that the safety of aircraft using M503 was of ""utmost importance,"" saying that operational coordination between the flight operation regions needed to be addressed and resolved. 
""The routes could enlarge the airspace capacity in the region, alleviate the air traffic congestion, improve the punctuality for the surrounding airports and serve as a bypass when surrounding air routes are closed for various reasons.""

China considers Taiwan a wayward province, and relations have cooled dramatically since Tsai Ing-wen of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party took office as Taiwan's president in 2016.

The former British colony is grappling with a growing mountain of waste resulting from China's ban this year on imports of 24 types of unprocessed rubbish – part of an effort to upgrade its recycling industry and reduce pollution.
The Hong Kong government acknowledges its inability to cope with the problem, saying that it lacks the land to develop an effective recycling industry. Critics say, meanwhile, that the city has done too little to upgrade and develop its waste management system.
""Hong Kong is a rich city with third-world quality recycling,"" said Doug Woodring, founder and managing director of Ocean Recovery Alliance, a Hong Kong-based non-government organization. ""It has been too easy to send unprocessed waste to China.""
Until last year, Hong Kong exported over 90 percent of its recyclables to China. That all changed at the end of 2017 as the effects of the Chinese ban – which included Hong Kong despite its status as a special administrative region of China – started to be felt around the world.
Huge mountains of old newspapers, cardboard and office scrap have piled up on Hong Kong's docks over the past few months while plastic waste has been dumped into the landfills.
A city of more than 7 million people, Hong Kong deposits around two thirds of its waste into landfills - 5.6 million tonnes annually. Little is recycled. 
Hong Kong's deputy director for environmental protection, Vicki Kwok, said in an interview that the densely populated city was unable to absorb all the recyclables due to a lack of available land in one of the world's most expensive property markets.
""We have to rely on exports and that makes us more susceptible, compared to other jurisdictions, to external market factors,"" she said.
Kwok said the government had announced multiple measures over the past few months to stymie the flow of garbage, including funding support to help upgrade local recyclers, and was prioritizing waste reduction at the source by appealing to businesses and consumers.
Green groups say the measures will do little to alleviate pressure on Hong Kong as the local recycling industry is unable to process all the waste that used to be sent to China. 
Woodring said the government was too reliant on expanding landfills as a means of disposing of trash rather than reallocating land for waste management.
""Hong Kong has the capability to build processing plants,"" he said, referring to recycling. ""There is plenty of land. The land has just been misused and misallocated.""
An average Hong Kong resident throws away around 1.4 kilograms daily, more than double that of Asian cities such as Tokyo, Seoul and Taipei, which have implemented extensive recycling programs, according to the government. 
Food waste, which accounts for the bulk of total waste generated, amounts to some 3,600 tonnes each day - the equivalent of 300 double-decker buses.
The government is aiming to open a facility this year that would convert food waste into energy and usable resources. However, the total recycling capacity will be a maximum of 200 tonnes daily while a second phase starting operations in 2021 will process a maximum of 300 tonnes per day.
Kwok said the government was planning to expand three active landfills set to reach capacity starting next year.
Hong Kong, which has already filled up 13 landfills in its history, is planning to start charging consumers for what they throw out but implementation is unlikely to take effect in the coming two years, the government has said.
Landfill waste is typically highly toxic and can severely damage surrounding ecosystems. The planned expansion of the landfills is likely to further impact a growing number of residents in affected areas, green groups have said.
In the meantime, municipal waste continues to rise unabatedly, surging 80 percent over the past 30 years, while Hong Kong's population has grown 36 percent, according to the government.
The environmental group Green Earth estimates that Hong Kong throws 5 million plastic bottles into landfills each day.
Edwin Lau, executive director of Green Earth, said the government needed to put in resources to subsidize and manage the industry directly. 
Hong Kong's recycling industry is dominated by private players that operate in a piecemeal fashion with overlapping logistics.

""The government has a role to tackle social issues such as the waste management issue,"" he said. ""Just expanding the landfills to cope with more waste, that is really backward thinking.""

Fabricio Alvarado, a 43-year-old ex-television host and the only lawmaker from the evangelical National Restoration party, led in several run-off scenarios in the Jan. 29-30 survey conducted by OPol Consultores.
Election experts say a second round run-off is likely as no candidate is expected to win at least 40 percent of the vote in the Feb. 4 election.
A run-off featuring the top two vote-getters would take place in early April.
In a hypothetical match-up against Antonio Alvarez of the National Liberation Party (PLN), Alvarado would win with 37 percent support compared to Alvarez's 34 percent, according to the poll.
The OPol Consultores poll has a margin of error of 3.3 percent.
Alvarado has even larger leads in potential run-offs with other candidates, including conservative lawyer Juan Diego Castro of the small National Integration Party (PIN) and Carlos Alvarado, the candidate from President Luis Guillermo Solis' ruling Citizens' Action Party (PAC).
Alvarado gained momentum in the race after he expressed his strong opposition to a January ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which called for the legalization of same-sex marriage.
Costa Rica is one of the more prosperous and stable countries in Central America. It had been ruled by a two-party dynasty until an upset in the 2014 vote that brought to power Solis, a center-left academic who had never held elected office.
Under Costa Rican law, Solis is barred from seeking immediate re-election.

398,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>","German industrial workers start 24-hour strikes in row over pay, hours","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Industrial workers in Germany started 24-hour strikes overnight, affecting companies including automotive supplier ZF Friedrichshafen [ZFF.UL] and lighting company Zumtobel (VI:ZUMV), amid a dispute over wages and working hours.
Powerful German union IG Metall has called for full-day walkouts through Friday, firing a last warning shot before it ballots for extended industrial action that could be crippling to companies reliant on a well-oiled supply chain of car parts and other components.
Emboldened by the fastest economic growth in six years and record low unemployment, the union is demanding an 8 percent pay rise over 27 months for 3.9 million metals and engineering workers across Europe's largest economy.
The union has also asked for workers to be given the right to reduce their weekly hours to 28 from 35 to care for children, elderly or sick relatives, and return to full time after two years.
This is IG Metall's first major push for shorter hours since workers staged seven weeks of strikes in 1984 to help secure a cut of the working week to 35 hours from 40 hours.
Employers have offered a 6.8 percent increase but rejected the demand for shorter hours unless they can also increase workers' hours when necessary.
Across Germany, around 260 companies are expected to be hit by walkouts lasting 24 hours each this week in support of IG Metall's demands.
Workers at printing press maker Heidelberger Druckmaschinen in Heidelberg are among those downing their tools on Wednesday, as are staff at Kion's (DE:KGX) Still brand of forklift trucks in Hamburg and at valve maker Gestra in Bremen.
Workers at automotive supplier Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] in Stuttgart are due to go on strike later on Wednesday, to be followed by Mercedes-Benz maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and sportscar firm Porsche (DE:VOWG_p) on Friday.
Both the union and the employers have left the door open to resuming talks after the planned strikes end on Friday but each said they demanded more willingness to make concessions.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Authorities confirmed on Wednesday that a missing Kiribati ferry had held more than 80 passengers, as Australian and U.S. planes scoured the central Pacific ocean for survivors, more than a week after it sunk.
The 17-metre (56-foot) catamaran was reported missing on Jan. 20, two days after it departed Nonouti Island on a 250 km (155 miles) trip to Betio in Kiribati.
Seven people rescued from a drifting dinghy on the weekend said the ferry broke up soon after setting out on Jan. 18 and that they had seen other passengers scramble aboard a liferaft, which was now the focus of the aerial search.
The New Zealand Defence Force had previously reported eight people had been rescued, but had revised that number. Reports on the total number of passengers had varied in recent days between 35 and 100. 
The Rescue Coordination Centre of New Zealand (RCCNZ), which is supporting the search, said in a statement on Wednesday that Kiribati authorities had confirmed about 80 passengers and five crew were aboard the ferry and seven of them had been rescued.
Two Australian aircraft and one from the U.S. coastguard were combing around 92,000 square km (35,500 square miles) of ocean for the missing liferaft, which was designed to hold about 25 people but capable of squeezing on more.
""It is still a rescue mission, not a recovery,"" Vince Cholewa, a spokesman for the RCCNZ told Reuters by phone.
""Obviously the longer it goes the smaller those chances become but there's still hope for finding survivors.""
A New Zealand plane spotted a dinghy on Sunday with seven people, including a 14-year-old girl, who had been adrift for days without water.
The seven were rescued by a nearby fishing vessel and were now making their way back towards land on a Kiribati patrol ship that was expected to arrive on Friday.
The survivors had been assessed by medics on board the patrol boat and were not in need of urgent hospital treatment, the RCCNZ spokesman said.

Richard Cousins, 58, his two sons, his fiancée and her daughter, and the pilot were killed when the plane hit the water shortly after takeoff on December 31.
In its preliminary report, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said the plane was approximately 1 km (0.6 miles) off the standard course before the pilot turned the plane sharply right. Shortly afterwards, the plan nose-dived into the Hawkesbury River, north of Sydney.
""One of the key lines of enquiry for us is to try and work out exactly what was happening during that time, firstly why the pilot turned and then whether it was an attempt to turn around or a planned turn,"" Nat Nagy, executive director of the ATSB, told reporters in Sydney.
The ATSB said there was no evidence of a collision or bird strike and there was no sign of any problem with the controls of the plane.
Nagy said the ATSB will announce its findings should it determine the cause of the crash, but warned it may remain unsolved.

""It is possible that we are not going to find what happened in that cockpit,"" said Nagy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Victor Cha, a former White House official who had been the Trump administration's choice to be the next U.S. ambassador to South Korea, is no longer being considered for the post, U.S. officials said on Tuesday.
The Washington Post quoted people familiar with the matter as saying Cha, a Korean-American, had raised concerns with White House officials over their consideration of a risky limited strike on North Korea and about the administration’s threats to tear up a bilateral trade deal with Seoul.
One U.S. official acknowledged to Reuters that there had been policy disagreements, but did not offer specifics.
In an article in the Washington Post on Tuesday evening, Cha, who for months had been expected to be nominated for the sensitive diplomatic post in a major ally that has been vacant for over a year, made clear he was no longer being considered.
He said a preventative military strike was not the way to deal with the crisis over North Korea's development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States, saying it carried a huge risk of escalating into a war that could kill hundreds of thousands of Americans. 
""Force will be necessary to deal with a North Korea if it attacks first, but not through a preventative strike that could start a nuclear war,"" Cha wrote.
Cha is a former director for Asian affairs on the White House National Security Council and served as deputy head of the U.S. delegation in talks with North Korea over its nuclear program during the George W. Bush administration.
""The White House has moved on to other potential candidates,” another U.S. official said, adding that the administration was looking for the “right person” to nominate. The official declined to give the reason for Cha being dropped from consideration.
News that Cha was out of the running came just ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's first State of the Union speech on Tuesday night, during which he was expected to address North Korea, his most pressing foreign policy challenge.
The administration has said all options are on the table in dealing with North Korea and officials say Trump and his advisers have discussed the possibility of a limited ""bloody nose"" strike, alarming experts who warn that this could trigger catastrophic retaliation, especially on South Korea. 
Officials have repeated stressed the administration prefers a diplomatic solution and debate on military options has lost some momentum in recent weeks after North and South Korea resumed talks ahead of next month's Winter Olympics to be held in the South.
In July, Cha called for a new approach to diplomacy toward North Korea, arguing that China must be a central part of future negotiations and should pay for Pyongyang to halt and roll back its nuclear and missile programs. (http://wapo.st/2x2vCgL)
In recent tweets and retweets on Twitter, Cha has highlighted the administration's policy on tougher sanctions and articles stressing the importance of diplomacy.
Experts reacted with concern on Twitter to Tuesday's news.
""This is a huge story. And extremely worrying,"" said Tom Wright, a senior foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution.
""For months I thought Trump admin was bluffing on a preventive strike...but the news about Victor Cha no longer being nominated is the type of costly signaling that convinces me I may have been wrong. They are seriously considering it.""
Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia under President Barack Obama, expressed astonishment.
""Wow. To drop an Ambassador nomination for a major treaty ally in the midst of a major crisis is unprecedented, and borders on strategic malpractice.""
The administration's failure to fill the post and a number of other key foreign policy positions has brought criticism in Congress and among former U.S. official and experts.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported in December that the administration had formally requested South Korea's approval for the nomination. 
South Korean officials had said they were hoping Cha would be in position in time for the Olympics, which will be attended by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence.

They said the aircraft were flying at high altitude, which differentiates it from ageing Syrian airforce.
The opposition-run Civil Defence service said a further 20 people were wounded in the strike. Video released by local activists showed extensive damage, with produce mixed up with human parts.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the footage
A resident said the attack took place at the busiest time of the day.
Russia's defense ministry regularly says it is attacking hardline Islamist militants. It denies opposition and witness accounts that its warplanes target market places, medical centers and residential areas away from frontlines. 
Syrian media made no mention of the strikes. 
Civil Defence workers and residents said dozens of raids have since Sunday struck the towns of Khan Sheikhoun, Maarat al Numan, Saraqeb and scores of villages. 
On Monday, warplanes bombed a potato market in nearby Saraqeb, killing at least 11 people, mostly farmers and traders. Shortly after that warplanes knocked out of action the only public hospital in the city, which was supported by French charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).
MSF said in a statement the attack on the hospital killed at least five people, including a child, and injured six. It said this was the second strike on the hospital in just over a week.
Russia has escalated its strikes in Idlib in recent months, throwing its military weight behind a Syrian military campaign to push deeper into the mainly rebel-held northwestern province.

403,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 08:15PM ET</span>","I'm not a quitter, says UK's May as leadership questions stack up","By William James
WUHAN, China (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday defied critics calling for her to resign, saying she was not a quitter and that she has a long-term job to do: delivering Brexit and domestic reform.
May has come under fire in recent days from several factions within her own party. She has been accused by eurosceptics of watering down Brexit, by pro-EU lawmakers of risking Britain's economy, and by others who say her domestic agenda is too timid.
""I've said to you before, I'm not a quitter and there is a long-term job to be done,"" she told reporters on her way to China for a trade visit when asked about the recent criticism of her leadership and reports of a potential attempt to oust her.
""That job is about getting the best Brexit deal, about ensuring that we take back control of our money, our laws, our borders, that we can sign trade deals around the rest of the world. But it is also about our domestic agenda.""
The leadership question dominated a briefing with journalists on board a Royal Air Force jet to China where she will meet President Xi Jinping, with an eye on securing better access to Chinese markets and an eventual free trade deal.
Media reports have said the number of 'no confidence' letters submitted by lawmakers from May's own party is nearing the threshold which would trigger a leadership contest. The committee which holds the letters does not comment on the actual number.
May's future as leader of the ruling Conservative Party has been subject to heightened speculation after she gambled on a snap election last year which went badly wrong and cost her party its majority in parliament.
During a similar trade-focused visit to Japan last year May first used the ""I'm not a quitter"" phrase, vowing to fight the next British election as leader in 2022.
Since then the pressure has been amplified by gaffes, scandals, and a growing concern among some that constant infighting over Brexit was drowning out attempts to win back the voters the party lost at the 2017 election.
Responding to one of more than 10 questions about her leadership during a 25 minute briefing, May defended her record by singling out housing, education and employment rates as areas where her government has made progress.
But, she acknowledged a need to make sure the messages are better heard by voters and her own party.
""Are you asking me is there more for us to do, talk to people about, more generally about what we are achieving and what we are doing? ... Yes,"" she said.

""There is always more for us to be able to do to talk to people about what we're achieving.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The social divide revealed by Britain's 2016 vote to leave the European Union is not only here to stay but deepening, according to academic research published on Wednesday.
Think tank The UK in a Changing Europe said Britons were unlikely to change their minds about leaving the EU, despite the political and economic uncertainty it has brought, because attitudes are becoming more entrenched.
""The (Brexit) referendum highlighted fundamental divisions in British society and superimposed a leave-remain distinction over them. This has the potential to profoundly disrupt our politics in the years to come,"" said Anand Menon, the think tank's director.
Britain is negotiating a deal with the EU which will shape future trade relations, breaking with the bloc after four decades, but the process is complicated by the divisions within parties, society and the government itself.
Menon said the research, based on a series of polls over the 18-month period since Britain voted to leave the European Union, showed 35 percent of people self-identify as ""Leavers"" and 40 percent as ""Remainers"".
Research also found that both sides had a tendency to interpret and recall information in a way that confirmed their pre-existing beliefs which also added to the deepening of the impact of the vote.
The differences showed fragmentation was more determined by age groups and location than by economic class.
Polls have shown increasing support for a second vote on whether or not to leave the European Union once the terms of departure are known, but such a vote would not necessarily provide a different result, a poll by ICM for the Guardian newspaper indicated last week.
The report also showed that age was a better pointer to how Britons voted than employment. Around 73 percent of 18 to 24-year-olds voted to stay in the EU, but turnout among that group was lower than among older voters.
""British Election Study surveys have suggested that, in order to have overturned the result, a startling 97 percent of under-45s would have had to make it to the ballot box, as opposed to the 65 percent who actually voted,"" the report said.
The difference between generations became even more pronounced in the 2017 general election, when the largest gap in how different generations voted was measured in Britain.

The British Election Study has been conducted by academics at every general election since 1964 and looks at why people vote, and why they vote the way they do.

406,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 06:37PM ET</span>","China's #MeToo movement in colleges initially encouraged by authorities, then frustrated","By Christian Shepherd
BEIJING (Reuters) - After declaring they were ready to fight sexual harassment on university campuses, the Chinese authorities now appear to be seeking to contain a nascent #MeToo movement.
On Jan. 14,  China's education ministry announced it had stripped a professor at Beihang University in Beijing, who is facing sexual harassment allegations, of an academic title and said it will not tolerate activity that harms students and will look into setting up a robust mechanism to prevent sexual harassment. 
A week later, more than fifty professors put their names to an online proposal calling for a detailed and strict set of rules to combat campus sexual harassment.
But a march planned that day from Beihang to the University of International Business and Economics (UIBE), another Beijing school where a professor has faced accusations of harassment, was canceled by organizers, two sources involved in its planning told Reuters.  
The organizers declined to say why it was called off, but three would-be participants, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said they were told by their school not to attend. Neither university would comment on the proposed march.
There has also been censorship of online postings supporting the #MeToo movement and some universities have warned students to tone down the campaign, according to women rights activists and students.
The education ministry declined to respond to phone calls and faxes seeking comment.
The authorities have been slowly acknowledging in state-media commentaries that there is a systematic problem of sexual harassment on Chinese college campuses. 
On Jan. 7, the Chinese Communist Party’s paper, the People’s Daily, said that victims of sexual harassment should be shown support if they go public with allegations, and the Guangming Daily, another official party publication, said on Jan. 17 that the issue of sexual harassment in education cannot be ignored.  
But while the issue of sexual harassment has become increasingly high profile on campuses in China, there have - in contrast to the United States - been few public allegations of sexual harassment in other areas of Chinese society, including politics, business and entertainment.
A third of Chinese college students say they have suffered sexual violence or sexual assault, according to data from the China Family Planning Association released in 2016, with the most common allegations being that they were harassed with sexual language and forced to kiss someone or suffered inappropriate touching.
     
LOCKED THE DOOR
The catalyst for a Chinese #MeToo-style movement came on Dec. 31 when Luo Xixi, a U.S.-based Chinese software engineer, published a blog post accusing Chen Xiaowu, a professor at Beihang, of sexual harassment.
In her post, Luo republished an account, originally run anonymously on Chinese website Zhihu.com in October 2017, of an evening 12 years ago when she alleges Chen had driven her to a house off-campus, locked the door and tried to force himself upon her. She said he relented when she started crying and said she was a virgin.
After conducting an investigation, Beihang said Chen was found to have sexually harassed students and was removed from his positions at the university. The education ministry stripped him of a title soon after.
Beihang declined to comment further.
In an interview with the Beijing Youth Daily published on Jan. 1, Chen said he had not broken any regulations and said the accuracy of the claims against him would be determined by the investigation. He has not spoken publicly since the investigation came to its conclusion.
Reuters was unable to contact Chen for comment. 
Luo told Reuters by phone that the responses of the university, state-media, the ministry and the Chinese public, have been overwhelmingly and unexpectedly positive.
She said the university initially had been slow to respond after she contacted them in October. “They would take action bit by bit, saying that they have not yet had instructions from above, that there is no relevant law and regulation, that there is no precedent to follow,” she said.
But once her named post went viral and the People’s Daily ran a commentary supporting her decision to go public, Beihang was swift to take action. “I was very satisfied with the speed of progress afterwards,"" she said.
The response is very different from some by the authorities in the recent past. In 2015, authorities detained five activists, later dubbed the ""Feminist Five,"" who were planning to defy government warnings to demonstrate against sexual harassment on public transport for International Women's Day. The activists were released a month later.    
     
MOLESTATION ALLEGATION
A second recent allegation was made anonymously, also on Zhihu.com, against UIBE professor Xue Yuan who was accused by the poster of having molested a student and ripped her clothing in university dormitories.
Xue has not responded publicly to the accusations. Reuters was unable to contact him for comment.
UIBE launched an investigation into the accusations and it recalled Xue from overseas to aid in the probe, according to a statement from the university. 
UIBE did not respond to questions sent by Reuters.
Women’s rights activists applauded the ministry’s moves against Chen and UIBE's investigation of Xue as a positive first step, but say they worry that online censorship and the authorities’ fears of grassroots movements causing social instability could prevent real change in dealing with sexual harassment at universities. 
The ministry has not yet released regulations that provide a clear definition of sexual harassment, activists say.
Students have in recent weeks posted open letters on social media calling for better prevention of campus sexual harassment. So far, there are more than 70, with hundreds of signatures.
But Zhang Leilei, a women's rights activist, told Reuters that some of the letters on social media calling attention to the issue have been deleted.  Reuters independently confirmed this was the case.
Chinese authorities regularly censor discussion of issues that might spur collective action. The country's cyberspace regulator did not respond to a request for comment. 
More than 10 universities have also summoned students to warn them against drawing too much attention to their complaints, Zhang said.
Xiao Meili, an activist whose open letter early this month calling for better sexual harassment prevention at the Communication University of China has been used as a template by others, said authorities' likely want to try to ""stabilize"" the movement. 
""If there was no censorship, if students were not called in for talks with their teachers, then the movement would be much wider and the conversation would be deeper,"" she said. 
One university in northern China warned student authors of an open letter not to post publicly about their demands for better harassment prevention measures as they might bring ""dishonor"" to the school, one of the students said, asking that their name and their school's not be used.
And an interview on harassment with Bai Benfeng, the head of Tsinghua University's postgraduate student Communist Party organization, published on Jan. 22 by a university paper, had been removed by the following day. 
Bai had said that Tsinghua, a top Chinese university, had a system where a single report of unethical behavior could jeopardize a teacher's position, but that sexual harassment education was inadequate for both teachers and students.

Tsinghua did not respond to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea's nuclear program has made strides in recent months but the country has not yet demonstrated all the components of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), including a survivable re-entry vehicle, the vice chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Tuesday.
Air Force General Paul Selva's remarks confirmed an assessment by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in December that North Korea's ICBM did not pose an imminent threat to the United States.
""What he has not demonstrated yet are the fusing and targeting technologies and survivable re-entry vehicle,"" Selva said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
""It is possible he has them, so we have to place the bet that he might have them, but he hasn't demonstrated them,"" Selva, the second highest-ranking U.S. military official, added. 
In November, North Korea said it had successfully tested a new type of ICBM that could reach all of the U.S. mainland and South Korea. U.S.-based experts said data from the test appeared to support that.
Selva said that if conflict were to break out, it was unlikely the United States would be able to get an early indication of North Korean launches.
""It is very unlikely that in a tactical situation, we would get any of the indications and warning that would precede a launch other than if we got lucky and saw the movement of the launch mechanism to the launch platform,"" Selva said.
He said that by using mobile erected launchers, the warning time for the United States had decreased from up to an hour to about a dozen minutes.
Selva added he was confident that if required the United States would be able to destroy ""most"" of North Korea's nuclear missile infrastructure. He declined to say what percentage of North Korean missiles the United States would be able to hit. 
The Trump administration has said all options are on the table in dealing with North Korea, but debate on military options has lost some momentum after North and South Korea resumed talks ahead of next month's Winter Olympics in the South.
Selva said the Pentagon's upcoming nuclear posture review, expected to be released on Friday, would lay out the future of nuclear modernization and may include new missiles on submarines.

A leaked draft policy document posted online this month said the United States would pursue development of a new nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile.

Antonov did not identify the U.S. intelligence officials with whom he met.
The Central Intelligence Agency declined to comment. Coats' office said that while it does not discuss U.S. intelligence officials' schedules, ""any interaction with foreign intelligence agencies would have been conducted in accordance with U.S. law and in consultation with appropriate departments and agencies.""
News of Naryshkin's secret visit poured fresh fuel on the battles pitting the Trump administration and its Republican defenders against Democrats over investigations into Moscow's alleged 2016 election interference.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer demanded that the administration ""immediately come clean and answer questions - which U.S. officials did he meet with? Did any White House or National Security Council official meet with Naryshkin? What did they discuss?""
The key question, Schumer told reporters, is whether Naryshkin's visit accounted for the administration's decision on Monday not to slap new sanctions on Russia under a law passed last year to punish Moscow's purported election meddling.
""Russia hacked our elections,"" Schumer said. ""We sanctioned the head of their foreign intelligence and then the Trump administration invites him to waltz through our front door.""
A January 2017 U.S. intelligence report concluded that Russia conducted an influence campaign of hacking and other measures aimed at swinging the 2016 presidential vote to Trump over his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton.
Last week, the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant reported that the Netherlands intelligence concluded that some of the Russians running a hacking operation, known as ""Cozy Bear"", against Democratic organizations were SVR agents.
CIA Director Mike Pompeo told the BBC in an interview last weekend that he had not ""seen a significant decrease"" in Russian attempts at subversion in Europe and the United States, and he expects Moscow to meddle in November's U.S. mid-term elections. 
Congressional panels and Special Counsel Robert Mueller are investigating Russia's alleged interference and possible collusion between Moscow and Trump's election campaign. Russia denies it meddled and Trump dismissed the allegations of collusion as a political witch hunt.
Naryshkin's visit coincided with other serious disputes in U.S.-Russian relations. They include Russia’s 2014 seizure of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine and Russia’s military intervention on the government’s side in the Syrian civil war.
Washington and Moscow cooperate in some areas, including the fight against Islamic militant groups, officials said.
For example, a month ago the United States provided advance warning to Russia that allowed it to thwart a terrorist plot in St. Petersburg, the White House said.
Naryshkin, who was appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin to head the SVR in September 2016, was sanctioned by the Obama administration in March 2014 as part of the U.S. response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea. At the time, he was speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament.
He was banned from entering the United States, but sanctions experts said there are processes for providing people under sanction permission to enter for official business. Meetings between foreign intelligence chiefs, even from rival nations, mostly are kept secret but are not unusual.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican on Tuesday rebuked a senior cardinal who said its diplomats were ""selling out"" Chinese Catholics loyal to the pope as part of a deal aimed at normalizing ties with Beijing's communist government.
In a sharply worded statement, the Vatican said it was surprising and regrettable that some people in the Church were ""fostering confusion and controversy"".
It came a day after Cardinal Joseph Zen, the outspoken former archbishop of Hong Kong, caused a stir with a long post on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that was highly critical of the Vatican.
The statement, which did not name Zen but which official Vatican sources said was prompted by the controversy he began, said it was ""surprising and regrettable"" that some were promoting ""a presumed difference of thought and action"" between Pope Francis and his top aides over China strategy.
Zen has often criticized the Vatican's attempt at rapprochement with the government of China, where Catholics are split between an ""underground"" Church that recognizes the pope and those belonging to a state-controlled group where bishops are appointed by the government.
In his post, Zen, 86, referred to a report by AsiaNews agency about the activity of Vatican negotiators seeking to reunite the two Churches ahead of possible resumption of diplomatic ties between the Vatican and Beijing that were severed after the communist takeover in 1949.
AsiaNews said last week that Vatican negotiators had asked two bishops loyal to the pope to give up their posts to make room for two backed by the government.
The main point of contention between the Vatican and Beijing has for decades been which side can appoint bishops.
In his post, Zen said the pope had told him that he instructed his aides ""not to create another Mindszenty case"".
He was referring Cardinal Joseph Mindszenty, who was freed from jail during Hungary's short-lived anti-Soviet uprising in 1956 and given refuge in the U.S. embassy in Budapest for 15 years before the Vatican forced him to leave the country.
Critics at the time said the Vatican had sold out to the communists but the Holy See said it was necessary to protect the Church from more persecution.

In his post criticizing Vatican diplomacy, Zen wrote: ""So, do I think that the Vatican is selling out the Catholic Church in China? Yes, definitely, if they go in the direction which is obvious from all they are doing in recent years and months"".

SOCHI, Russia (Reuters) - A Syrian peace conference in Russia ended on Tuesday with a statement calling for democratic elections, but ignoring key opposition demands after a day marred by squabbles and heckling of the Russian foreign minister.
The participants also agreed to set up a committee to rewrite the Syrian constitution at the conference, which much of the opposition said aimed to serve the interests of President Bashar al-Assad and his close ally, Moscow.
A final statement said Syrians must decide their future through elections, but did not say whether Syrian refugees would be allowed to take part, something sought by Assad's opponents and Western states. Syrians had the ""exclusive right"" to pick their political system free of foreign intervention, it added.
It also urged the preservation of security forces without calling for their reform, another demand of the opposition.
""This conference is tailor-made for Assad and his terrorist regime,"" said Mustafa Sejari, a senior official in a Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel group that operates in northern Syria. ""The Sochi statement does not concern us and is not even a subject of discussion.""
Russia hosted what it called a Syrian Congress of National Dialogue in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. After helping turn the tide of the war in Syria in Assad's favor, Moscow has cast itself as a Middle East peace broker.
The event was boycotted, however, by the leadership of the Syrian opposition, while powers such as the United States, Britain and France stayed away because of what they said was the Syrian government's refusal to properly engage.
Western countries support a separate United Nations-mediated peace process, which has so far failed to yield progress toward ending a war that is entering its eighth year. The latest round of those talks took place last week in Vienna.
""We don't need a new process, we don't need any competitive process,"" U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura, who attended the Sochi conference, told reporters in New York by phone on Monday.
He said the constitutional committee agreed in Sochi ""will become a reality in Geneva,"" where most of the U.N.-led Syria peace talks have been held. De Mistura also said he would decide the criteria for committee members and select about 50 people - from government, opposition and independent groups.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov helped open the Sochi conference on Tuesday by reading out a statement from President Vladimir Putin saying the conditions were ripe for Syria to turn ""a tragic page"" in its history.
But some delegates stood up and began heckling him, accusing Moscow of killing civilians in Syria with its air strikes.
The incident was broadcast on Russian state TV where two security guards were shown approaching one man in the audience indicating that he should sit down.
Other delegates shouted out their support for Russia. 
FLAG ROW
In a further setback, one group of delegates, which included members of the armed opposition who had flown in from Turkey, refused to leave Sochi airport until Syrian government flags and emblems - which they said were offensive - had been removed.
Ahmed Tomah, the head of the delegation, said his group had boycotted the congress and would fly back to Turkey because of the flag row and what he called broken promises to end the bombardment of civilians.
""We were surprised that none of the promises that were given had been kept, the ferocious bombing of civilians had not stopped. Nor were the flags and banners of the regime removed,"" he said in a video recorded at the airport.
Artyom Kozhin, a senior diplomat at the Russian Foreign Ministry, acknowledged there had been some complications.
""Some problems have arisen with a group of the armed opposition that has come from Turkey which has made its participation dependent on additional demands,"" he wrote on social media.
Lavrov had spoken by phone twice to his Turkish counterpart and been told that the problem would be resolved, said Kozhin.
Turkish and Iranian government delegations also attended the congress.
Vitaly Naumkin, a Russian expert on the Middle East who serves as an adviser to de Mistura, told reporters the problems encountered by organizers had not tarnished the event.

""Nothing awful happened,"" said Naumkin. ""Nobody is fighting anyone else. Nobody is killing anyone. These were standard working moments.""

The attack, carried out by Kurdish militants as the convoy was in transit in northern Idlib, left one civilian worker dead and wounded a soldier and another civilian, the army said in a statement.
The convoy was dispatched to Idlib as part of Turkey's effort to help create a ""de-escalation"" zone there, under a deal brokered by Russia in August.
Foreign powers agreed to establish four such zones, including Idlib, in opposition territory in Syria after years of civil war. But the former al Qaeda branch that controls the province has pledged to keep fighting Syrian government forces and their allies.
Turkey last week launched an air and ground offensive elsewhere in northwest Syria, targeting the Kurdish YPG militia in the Afrin region. That has opened a new front in the seven-year-old, multi-sided civil war and strained ties with NATO ally Washington.
Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist organization and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a deadly, three-decade insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast.
The United States has armed a YPG-spearheaded militia in the fight against Islamic State in Syria.

VIENNA (Reuters) - The Hungarian and Austrian prime ministers - both hardliners on immigration - came away from a meeting on Tuesday with a pledge for close cooperation in Europe if not a formal alliance
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz led his conservative party to victory in Austria's October parliamentary election, then struck a coalition deal with the anti-immigration Freedom Party, making Austria the only western European country with a far-right party in government.
Both of Austria's ruling parties have adopted language similar to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's on immigration and Islam, pledging to cut benefits for refugees and warning darkly that Muslim ""parallel societies"" are emerging in cities like left-leaning Vienna.
Given their similar views, Kurz has said his country could serve as a go-between in the European Union for the West and the Visegrad group of eastern states, which includes Hungary and Poland, two countries that frequently defy Brussels on issues including immigration and fundamental rights.
""Particularly since the migration crisis, tensions within the European Union have grown more and more,"" Kurz told a joint news conference with Orban. ""Our big goal is to be a bridge-builder here between the Visegrad states and other, western European states.""
Kurz made immigration the core of his campaign after Austria took in one of the biggest contingents of asylum seekers in Europe's migration crisis in 2015, relative to its population. Many of those people came via Hungary, until Orban fenced off much of its border with Serbia.
The Freedom Party's leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, who is now vice chancellor and who met Orban later on Tuesday, has said Austria should move away from its usual western European allies, including Germany, by joining Visegrad - but Kurz and Orban said that was not on the agenda.
""Neither the Visegrad states have the desire to expand the group of Visegrad states nor is there the desire here to join,"" Kurz said. ""What is needed is good cooperation between neighboring states, between Austria and Hungary.""
FOOT IN BOTH CAMPS
Kurz has sought to reassure allies that his government will be pro-European, even though he and Strache favor a smaller EU that focuses on fewer tasks, especially securing its external borders.
He has sided with Visegrad in saying the EU should stop pushing countries to take quotas of relocated asylum seekers. But he supported the bloc's steps against Poland for threatening the rule of law and democratic principles. And he has taken steps that could complicate a rapprochement with Orban.
Kurz's government is continuing Austria's decades-old policy of opposing nuclear energy, and said this month it would sue the European Commission for allowing Hungary to expand its Paks power plant.
It has also decided to curb child benefits for workers whose children live in poorer countries, including Hungary. Visegrad member Slovakia has already objected, and Hungary has said people who pay the same taxes in Austria should be entitled to the same benefits.
The two sides repeated their disagreements on those points, but Orban said Budapest would treat them as European rather than bilateral issues and not let them harm the two countries' ties.

""Austria understands us, and also understands western European countries. The role it set for itself is very favourable for Hungary,"" Orban said. ""I am grateful to the Chancellor for defining a bridge role (for Austria).""

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations on Tuesday condemned a recent wave of air strikes on medical centers in rebel-held parts of Syria including one that put a hospital serving 50,000 people out of action.
The Syrian government, which is backed by Russian air power in its almost seven-year-long war with rebels, says it only targets militants and has repeatedly denied striking civilian facilities such as hospitals.
""I am appalled by the ongoing attacks on hospitals and other medical facilities in northwestern Syria, depriving hundreds of thousands of people of their basic right to health,"" said Panos Moumtzis, U.N. regional coordinator for the Syria crisis.
Syria's war shows no sign of ending and a peace conference hosted by Russia on Tuesday was marred by discord.
On Monday, two air strikes damaged the 18-bed Owdai Hospital in Saraqib city in rebel-held Idlib governorate supported by the aid charity Médecins Sans Frontières, killing at least five people, including a child, and injuring six. 
The hospital, which experienced a near miss that blew out windows on Jan. 21, was hit while receiving people wounded in an air strike on Saraqib´s main market, which the United Nations said had killed at least 16 people. 
It was the fourth time in 10 days that air strikes had caused major structural damage to a hospital in Saraqib, said Moumtzis. An air attack also wrecked a medical center serving at least 10,000 people in Aleppo governorate on the same day.
""The loss of the provision of these medical services, including surgical and reproductive health services, will have a staggering effect on vulnerable communities affected by this conflict,"" he said in a statement.
In 2017, there were 112 verified attacks on health facilities in Syria, and there had been at least 13 so far this year, according to Moumtzis. 
A separate U.N. report said 272,345 people had been displaced between Dec. 15 and Jan. 24 in Idlib governorate, and health organizations there were being stretched to the limit. 
It described heavy fighting between rebels and Syrian government forces in the eastern part of the governorate, mainly around the town of Abul Thohur and its air base, with numerous civilian casualties and ""high levels of psychosocial distress among girls, boys, women and men"". 

Saraqib's town council has declared a disaster zone and called on the international community to intervene, the U.N. report said.

An Israeli spokeswoman said a large crowd of Palestinians set tyres ablaze and threw rocks at the troops, who responded with ""dispersal means"".
She could not confirm initially whether troops had used live rounds but said the military was aware of the Palestinian fatality and that the incident was being investigated.
The Palestinian health ministry named the dead youth as Layth Abu Naeem and said he was 16-years-old.
Faraj al-Nassan, the head of al-Mugheir village, said a confrontation had erupted after Israeli troops entered his village and that the youth was hit from close range. He was taken to hospital in nearby Ramallah.
Tensions in the region have risen since U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on Dec. 6 recognizing disputed Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and at least 19 Palestinians and one Israeli have been killed since.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Almost a dozen countries have agreed to advance their annual contributions to the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees to help it plug a major shortfall after a partial cut-off of U.S. funding, its chief said on Tuesday. 
The move by the Trump administration appears linked to a United Nations vote rejecting Washington's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, said Pierre Kraehenbuehl, head of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).
The United States said this month it would withhold $65 million of $125 million it had planned to send to UNRWA, which runs schools and clinics for 5.3 million Palestinians across the Middle East, including in Gaza and the West Bank.
""It is very clear that the decision by the United States was not related to our performance,"" Kraehenbuehl told a news briefing, citing his ""very good meetings"" with senior U.S. officials in Washington in November.
""This has to be part of the debate that took place around Jerusalem, the vote on Jerusalem at the (U.N.) General Assembly. 
""And I simply note here again that humanitarian funding should be preserved from being tied up with political considerations,"" he added.
Eleven countries have agreed to advance their donations to finance UNRWA programs in coming months, Kraehenbuehl said after meeting donor representatives, adding: ""There a sense of coming together.""
Seven countries - Switzerland, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany and Russia - had already transferred early funds while four - Belgium, Kuwait, the Netherlands and Ireland - had pledged to do so soon, he said.
Kraehenbuehl launched an appeal for some $800 million to provide aid to Palestinian refugees in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinian territories this year.
He said UNRWA received $360 million from the United States last year but Washington had cleared only $60 million for 2018 - a drop of $300 million that he called ""a very severe and dramatic change"".
UNRWA is supported almost entirely by voluntary contributions from states and the United States is the largest contributor. U.S. President Donald Trump has questioned the value of such funding, and the U.S. State Department said UNRWA needed to make unspecified reforms.
Trump's endorsement in December of Israel's claim to Jerusalem as its capital drew universal condemnation from Arab leaders and criticism around the world. It broke with decades of U.S. policy that the city's status must be decided in peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
More than 120 countries defied Trump on Dec. 22 and voted in favor of a U.N. General Assembly resolution calling for the United States to drop its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

416,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>","Diplomat tells Germany: Raise military spending, don't be a freeloader","By Andrea Shalal and Andreas Rinke
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany must increase its military spending and take a more active role in conflicts to avoid being seen as one of the world's biggest freeloaders, an influential diplomat said on Wednesday.
Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference and Germany's former envoy to Washington, urged the country's would-be government coalition partners to reverse their restrictive stance on arms exports and formally back commitments to NATO.
Ischinger said he considered it ""undignified"" for Germany's sole contribution to the global fight against Islamic State to be reconnaissance flights. 
""The biggest European Union state is all for victory over Islamic State in Syria and Iraq; we take photos, but we leave the dirty business of shooting to others,"" he told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.
""We should not develop the reputation of being one of the world's best freeloaders,"" he added.
Germany has come under increasing pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to increase its military spending, but the issue remains divisive in a country scarred by its Nazi past, with many Germans favoring a more pacifist stance. 
A senior U.S. military official on Monday warned that failure by the next German government to fulfill a pledge to boost military spending to two percent of its economic output will weaken the NATO alliance.
Germany spent about 1.13 percent of its gross domestic output on the military in 2017, according to industry estimates, and the percentage may drop further if economic growth continues to outpace modest increases in military spending.
Ischinger said the German government had increased its engagement in global affairs in line with a 2014 pledge at the annual MSC conference, including through its deployment of German troops to Lithuania to protect NATO forces, and its participation in a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali.
But he said Germany still remained reluctant to take on combat roles, and had failed to offer clear ideas for how to shape the future of Europe.
FOREIGN POLICY
He also criticized the lack of substantial foreign policy initiatives in a blueprint agreed by Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats in their bid to renew the coalition that has ruled Germany since 2013.""They're losing themselves in the fine print,"" he said, urging Germany to play a more decisive role in shaping the future of Europe, including by pushing for more areas where the EU decides by majority instead of by unanimous consent.
""Without majority decisions, Europe will always allow itself to be divided,"" Ischinger said, citing divisions on issues such as the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany.
The coalition blueprint does not mention the NATO 2-percent target given divisions between the political blocs, with Social Democrats arguing that Germany should spend more on development aid instead.
Ischinger said failure to explicitly state a commitment to the NATO target would ""ruin our credibility in this area"". He rejected comments in which Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, a Social Democrat, argued that other European countries would fear a Germany that spent that much of its budget on the military.
""How can it be that our rich country with over 80 million citizen doesn't have a single helicopter we can use in Afghanistan, not a single useable submarine,"" Ischinger said, referring to recent news reports confirmed by military officials. ""How can it be that we send our soldiers to Afghanistan without the best armored vests?""
Ischinger also criticized a move by the potential coalition to limit German arms exports to any parties involved in the Yemen conflict, saying such a move would complicate moves toward a joint European defense strategy.

""What we really need are unified European arms export guidelines that apply to everyone,"" he said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico is in talks with the United States on whether to allow U.S. federal air marshals to travel with Taser stun guns on cross-border flights with U.S. airlines, National Security Commissioner Renato Sales said in a TV interview on Tuesday.
Sales' comments come the day after Reuters exclusively revealed that Mexico and the United States were looking into an agreement that could allow armed U.S. federal air marshals to be deployed on commercial cross-border flights.
Mexico has been trying to prove itself a good ally to the United States in hopes this will help its efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in terms that are as favorable as possible.
In his interview with broadcaster Televisa, Sales said no memorandum of understanding had been signed with the United States, adding that talks to allow U.S. federal marshals in Mexico stretch back years.
""They would only be on commercial (U.S.) flights, on (U.S.) airlines, not on Mexican airlines,"" he said. ""But it's still not finalized ... we're still in talks.""
Reuters reported on Monday that the hardest part of the negotiations would center on allowing U.S. officials to carry arms, given that the use of weapons by foreigners in Mexico is sensitive and tightly regulated.
Sales said he understood that the U.S. federal air marshals would carry stun guns, not lethal weapons, and said they would be undercover, but did not give any further details. 
It was still not clear if the air marshals would fly on just U.S.-bound flights, Mexico-bound flights, or both.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) places sharp-shooters on certain domestic and international commercial flights to and from the United States to prevent militant attacks.
In a statement on Monday, Mexico's foreign ministry confirmed that the government was evaluating the plan's potential operational and security benefits but added that no agreement has yet been reached.
The foreign ministry has pushed hard to defend NAFTA ahead of a July 2018 election in which the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) is currently polling third.

Mexico, Canada and the United States are currently engaged in fraught negotiations to reshape NAFTA, a lynchpin of the Mexican economy that Trump has threatened to abandon.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - The number of asylum seekers crossing the Czech Republic dropped in 2017 to negligible numbers, police said on Tuesday amid a presidential election in which illegal migration has become a hot topic.
Although the country was largely untouched by a 2015 influx into the European Union of over one million migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East Africa and Asia, fears of Muslim immigration have dominated the election debate.
Police said they detained 172 migrants in 2017 who sought to illegally transit the Czech Republic, mostly coming from Austria and heading onwards to neighboring Germany. They were mainly from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.
That compared with 2,294 detentions during the peak of 2015, and 511 in 2016. In separate data, the Interior Ministry said 116 people applied for asylum in November 2017, a tiny fraction of those doing so in west European countries. 
Ex-communist central and eastern members of the EU with scant experience of non-Christian foreigners were the vanguard of a backlash against Germany's decision in 2015 to open its doors to around a million mostly Muslim migrants.
They rebuffed an EU plan to distribute migrants among member states according to annual quotas, even though the vast bulk of migrants wanted to settle in the wealthier west rather than poorer east of the bloc.
In the event, the flow of migrants has largely dried up since borders were sealed along the migrants' main overland Balkans corridor into the EU and Turkey stopped migrants taking boats across narrow sea channels to Greece. 
Nevertheless, positions on migration may prove decisive in the Czech Republic's closely contested presidential run-off on Jan. 26-27 in which academic Jiri Drahos is challenging incumbent Milos Zeman.
Zeman's re-election campaign has seized on immigration as its main theme with the slogan, ""Stop immigration and Drahos. This country is ours.""
Dozens of pro-Zeman billboards and media adverts suggest Drahos would be weak on rejecting EU pressure on each member state to accept migrants according to the quota system.
Like Zeman and all parliamentary parties, Drahos has repeatedly insisted that he rejects the idea of quotas and that the bloc should better guard its external borders against incoming asylum seekers. 

Opinion polls ahead of the run-off vote show the soft-spoken Drahos, who favors closer EU integration, is neck-and-neck or slightly ahead of Zeman, who has courted the far right by rejecting Muslim immigration.

By Robert Muller and Jan Lopatka
PRAGUE (Reuters) - Pro-EU academic Jiri Drahos is seeking to unseat anti-immigration political veteran Milos Zeman, who has sought closer relations with Russia and China, in a tight run-off in the Czech presidential election which started on Friday.
Many see the vote as a referendum on Zeman, 73, a former center-left prime minister who has shifted sharply to the right, with a brash style that has divided the EU nation.
(Czech election first round result from Jan 13: http://tmsnrt.rs/2D3BO8e) 
As well as leading calls against accepting migrants from mainly Muslim countries, he has focused on building ties with Beijing and Moscow, including calling for the removal of EU sanctions on Russia imposed over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea. 
The election mirrors divisions between more socially liberal and conservative camps that have featured in votes around Europe and also the United States. Zeman declared support for U.S. President Donald Trump before Trump's election in 2016 - a rare position among leaders in Europe.
""Society is now really divided 50-50 and it depends which voters are going to come and vote,"" analyst Jiri Pehe said. ""For Jiri Drahos, it would be important that young people from big cities come to vote.""
In a final poll released on Monday, the 68-year-old chemistry professor led with 47 percent to 43 percent for Zeman, while 10 percent were undecided. Bookmakers have however tilted their odds in favor of Zeman's victory.
The president, elected for five years, is not involved in day-to-day politics but appoints central bankers and judges, and picks which politician can form a government.
Zeman has the backing of Prime Minister Andrej Babis, a billionaire businessman who rules in caretaker capacity after his minority cabinet lost a confidence vote in parliament last week.
Zeman, whose term does not end until March 7, has pledged to give Babis a second chance to form a government regardless of the election result.
IMMIGRATION FEARS
Zeman has benefited from, and reinforced, Czech hostility to immigration from Muslim countries. The eurosceptic country received just 116 asylum applications in November last year.
Drahos, a former head of the Academy of Sciences, has also rejected a quota on refugees. He has however put more emphasis on building relations with European partners. 
""I will probably vote Zeman,"" Prague sales clerk Daniela Simkova said. ""If I had to pick based on likeability, I would vote Drahos; he looks good and carries himself well. But Zeman does not want migrants, and for me, that is important.""
In a final television debate on Thursday, the two men sparred over policy on Russia. Drahos said he saw Russia as a security threat because it views NATO, to which the Czechs belong, as its adversary. Zeman said it was not a security threat and he attacked Drahos for inexperience.

Polling stations opened at 1300 GMT on Friday and close at 1300 on Saturday. Results are expected within several hours.

KABUL/PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The United States aims to press the Taliban on the battlefield to convince them that they will have to negotiate peace, a senior U.S. diplomat said on Tuesday, a day after President Donald Trump rejected talks following a series of attacks.
Speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, Trump condemned the Taliban for recent carnage in the Afghan capital Kabul, and said the United States was not prepared to talk now. He pledged to ""finish what we have to finish"". 
Trump's comments suggested he sees a military victory over the Taliban, an outcome that U.S. military and diplomatic officials say cannot be achieved with the resources and manpower he has authorized.
But U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan told a news conference in Kabul there was no change in the U.S. policy of forcing the Taliban through military pressure into talks.
Trump's comments were a reflection of the violence over recent days which indicated ""at least some members of the Taliban are not interested in having a discussion about a peaceful future"", Sullivan said.
""That doesn't change the long-range strategy of our policy which it to be firm militarily to convince the Taliban, or significant elements of the Taliban, that there isn't a military solution to the security situation here, that ultimately peace and security of Afghanistan will be determined by peace talks.""
Trump last year ordered an increase in U.S. troops, air strikes and other assistance to Afghan forces. 
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said this month the strategy was working and pushing the insurgents closer to talks.
That was before a suicide bomber penetrated the highly guarded center of Kabul on Saturday and detonated an ambulance laden with explosives, killing more than 100 people and wounding at least 235. 
That attack followed a brazen Taliban assault on the city's Intercontinental Hotel on Jan. 20, in which more than 20 people, including four Americans, were killed.
The Taliban said the attacks were a message to Trump that his policy of aggression would not work. 
'WAR-MONGERING'
Earlier, a spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said the Taliban had crossed a ""red line"" with attacks in Kabul and lost the chance for peace, and had to be defeated.
""We have to look for peace on the battlefield,"" said the spokesman, Shah Hussain Murtazawi.
The surge of violence has also raised new questions about U.S. relations with Pakistan, weeks after Trump denounced it for what he said was its failure to crack down on Taliban safe havens on its soil, and ordered big cuts in security aid.
Pakistan denies accusations that it fosters the Afghan war, and has condemned the recent attacks in Afghanistan.
A spokesman for the Taliban, fighting to oust foreign forces and defeat the U.S.-backed government, said earlier they never wanted to talk to the United States anyway.
""Their main strategy is to continue war and occupation,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.
""Donald Trump and his war-mongering supporters must understand that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. If you insist upon war, our mujahideen will not welcome you with roses,"" he said.
The United States believes the Haqqani network, a faction within the Taliban, was behind Saturday's bomb blast in Kabul.
It and Afghanistan have long accused Pakistan of supporting the Taliban, and the Haqqani network in particular, as assets to be used in its bid to limit the influence of old rival India in Afghanistan.

Pakistani officials were not immediately available for comment on Trump's rejection of peace talks but its embassy in Kabul cited Pakistani clerics as declaring suicide attacks unIslamic.

""It is critical that all parties minimize rhetoric, exercise restraint to avoid further escalation and work toward a resolution,"" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said at a joint appearance of the U.S. and Qatari foreign and defense ministers.
Last June the UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, cut off travel and trade ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism and their arch-rival Iran. Doha denies the charges and says the countries aim to curtail its sovereignty. 
""A united Gulf Cooperation Council bolsters our effectiveness on many fronts, particularly on counterterrorism, defeating ISIS Daesh, and countering the spread of Iran's malign influence,"" said Defense Secretary James Mattis, referring to the Islamic State militant group sometimes called ISIS or ISIL.
""It is thus critical that the GCC recovers its cohesion as the proud Gulf nations return to mutual support through a peaceful resolution that provides for enhanced regional stability and prosperity,"" he added.
The two men spoke along with their Qatari counterparts after the first of what is to become an annual U.S.-Qatar Strategic Dialogue. The GCC's members, all of whom are U.S. partners, are Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Qatar is host to U.S. and international forces at Al Udeid Air Base, which is home to the Combined Air Operations Center. The operation coordinates an array of data and intelligence from satellites, drones, radar and U.S. planes flying over Middle East hot spots and bombing Islamic State positions.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam listed a U.S.-based group still loyal to the now defunct state of South Vietnam as a terrorist organization on Tuesday, the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) said.
The California-based Provisional Government of Vietnam, led by U.S. citizen Dao Minh Quan, established groups inside Vietnam to ""execute acts of terrorism and sabotage, and assassinate officials"", the ministry said in a statement.
Quan was a ""former lieutenant"" of the U.S.-backed Republic of Vietnam, the statement said, referring to the now defunct state, also known as South Vietnam, which once ruled the southern half of the country until the Vietnam War ended in 1975. 
Quan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Embassy in Hanoi did not respond to an emailed request for comment sent outside office hours.
Despite sweeping economic reform in Vietnam, and increasing openness toward social change, including gay, lesbian and transgender rights, the ruling Communist Party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism.
Earlier this month, Vietnam jailed four men for flying the flag of South Vietnam. The flag, a bright yellow rectangle with three thin horizontal stripes, is used by political activists in Vietnam who oppose the Communist-controlled government in Hanoi.
A video on a website the MPS said was operated by Quan's group showed a convoy of cars moving through a U.S. town, some of which were flying the flag of South Vietnam. The website describes Quan as the ""Prime Minister"" of the Provisional Government of Vietnam. 
In late December, a Vietnamese court jailed 15 people for their part in an alleged April bomb plot by Quan's group at Tan Son Nhat airport, the transport hub which serves Ho Chi Minh City - formerly known as Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam.
Fifteen people acted on instructions from an overseas group which had used social media to spread propaganda and recruit its members, local media said, citing the court indictment.
Vietnam, one of the top 10 countries for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) users by numbers, has called for tougher internet controls and set up a military cyber unit to fight ""wrong"" views online.
The group ""planted fuel bombs in the car park and at the arrival hall at Tan Son Nhat International Airport"" in April, 2017,"" Tuesday's MPS statement said.

The 59-year-old Tomislav Kovac, who served as the Serb Republic interior minister and now lives in Serbia, is charged with participating in a joint criminal enterprise which aimed to exterminate Bosnian Muslims from the eastern town of Srebrenica.
The massacre involved the systematic slaughter of Muslims after Bosnian Serb forces, commanded by General Ratko Mladic, captured the U.N.-protected Srebrenica enclave in July 1995, the only episode of Bosnia's war to be defined as genocide by two U.N. courts.
Mladic was jailed for life in November for the massacre by a U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
More than 20 years after the 1992-95 Bosnian war ended, many suspected war criminals remain at large and victims are still being found in mass graves.
According to indictment, Kovac is also suspected of concealing the evidence of mass executions by digging up the victims' bodies from primary sites and scattering them in unmarked locations.
Kovac denied any wrongdoing in a 2016 video testimony from Belgrade in a case against a group of ex-Serb soldiers charged with Srebrenica genocide by the Bosnian war crimes court.

Around 1,500 people in Moscow and hundreds more in cities across Russia took to the streets on Sunday in a protest organized by Navalny to support a boycott of presidential elections in March.
Incumbent Vladimir Putin is widely expected to be re-elected, but Navalny says he has been unfairly barred from running over what he says is a trumped-up suspended prison sentence. 
Kira Yarmysh, Navalny's spokeswoman, and Ruslan Shaveddinov, an activist, hosted an online broadcast of Sunday's protests to Navalny's supporters from an undisclosed location outside Russia which the authorities were unable to stop.
Police used power tools to force entry into Navalny's Moscow headquarters where they shut down another online broadcast on the same day, citing a purported bomb threat. 
Police detained Yarmysh and Shaveddinov at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport soon after they landed back in Russia, footage the activists shared on social media showed.
""My fan club is meeting me at the airport. They say they didn't like our broadcast,"" Shaveddinov quipped on social media, sharing a photograph of himself from the airport in which two policemen were clearly visible. 
Police took the pair to a Moscow police station and told them they would be kept in overnight until a court hearing, Shaveddinov wrote on Twitter.
Navalny himself was detained for several hours on Sunday before being released without charge, his lawyer Olga Mikhailova told Reuters at the time, but would face court at a later date.

Berri supporters set ablaze tyres and blocked roads on Monday in protest against comments by Aoun's son-in-law, Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil who had called him ""a thug"" in a video that circulated on social media.
""What happened on the ground is a big mistake based on a mistake,"" Aoun said in a statement. ""I forgive all those who assaulted me and my family, and I look to those who insulted each other to forgive each other,"" he said. 
The Free Patriotic Movement party, founded by Aoun, said Bassil had already expressed regret for the comments and as far it was concerned the issue was over. Berri supporters have been demanding a public apology from Bassil. 
Political tensions between Berri, a Shi'ite, and Aoun, a Maronite Christian, have been escalating since December when Aoun signed a decree promoting dozens of army officers without the signature of Shi'ite Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil, one of Berri's closest aides.
The row threatens to ignite sectarian tensions in the run-up to a parliamentary election in May, and risks paralyzing Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri's coalition government which groups nearly all of Lebanon's main parties. 
In one incident on Monday, gunfire erupted near offices of Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) east of Beirut. The FPM and the Amal movement led by Berri traded blame.
Bassil expressed regret for his remarks in an interview with the Lebanese al-Akhbar newspaper on Monday, saying he had departed from his moral standards in the closed meeting.
But this did little to ease fury in the Berri camp, which has said Bassil crossed ""red lines"".
Hundreds of Berri supporters protested against Bassil in the Shi'ite town of Nabatieh in southern Lebanon on Tuesday. 
The FPM, following a meeting of its leadership, said Bassil had ""recalled"" the leaked comments and expressed regret. 
Berri and Aoun, both in their 80s, were civil war enemies. The conflict ended in 1990 when the Syrian army forced Aoun, then head of one of two rival governments, from the presidential palace and into exile.

Berri says Aoun exceeded his constitutional powers with the army promotions. Aoun says he did not.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - As U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional leaders discuss the fate of some 700,000 immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children, the young people whose lives hang in the balance fret about their future.
Reuters spoke to five people covered by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. Many older members of the group, nicknamed ""Dreamers,"" balance college classes and jobs amid a looming March 5 deadline set by Trump to repeal the program unless Congress preserves it.
""I knew DACA was going to be rescinded, or at least I thought it was, the day he won the election,"" said Javier Hernandez Kistte, 27, referring to Trump's anti-immigration stance during the 2016 presidential campaign. Kistte arrived in the country with his family from Mexico City when he was 8 years old. 
Trump wants tighter restrictions on immigration that he deems necessary to improve national security and protect the jobs of working class Americans. Supporters of the DACA program say eliminating it would punish people who were too young to know the consequences of their family's decision to move to the U.S. and remove productive people from the economy.
Last week, senior White House officials outlined a plan that would offer a path to citizenship to about 2 million young illegal immigrants. The proposal also called for a border wall and curbs on some legal immigration programs, measures some Democrats have called unacceptable.
Some DACA beneficiaries said they did not realize where their families were headed when they set off for the United States.
""My parents told me we were coming to Disneyland,"" said Karla Estrada, 26. ""We did not go to Disneyland.""
Living under the radar and working illegally, several of the young people recalled rough, impoverished neighborhoods, and seeing family members suffer depression or abuse drugs.
Barbara Hernandez, 26, of Santa Ana, California, said she had a brother who was fatally shot in a flurry of gang violence. 
""That threw our family into a really big depression and my mom and my dad separated,"" she said. 
DACA, which took effect in 2012, allowed Hernandez to work in education, but she quit her job when Trump said he was rescinding the program.
Brian Caballero, 25, lives in a converted ambulance on the campus of California State Polytechnic University in Pomona near Los Angeles, where he is pursuing a degree in electrical engineering. 
Martha Valenzuela, 23, was brought to the U.S. when she was 2 years old. She has no memories of Mexico. 
DACA allowed her to get a driver's license and to leave an informal job at a taqueria where she earned less than minimum wage. Now she works for a public relations firms as an account coordinator.
Looking at the possibility of the program being eliminated, Valenzuela is balancing preparations for a possible return to Mexico with activist work aimed at preserving DACA.

""It takes guts to have a dream and it takes guts to fight for it,"" she said.

429,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 11:11AM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia says it has seized over $100 billion in corruption purge,"By Stephen Kalin and Katie Paul
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's government has arranged to seize more than $100 billion through financial settlements with businessmen and officials detained in its crackdown on corruption, the attorney general said on Tuesday. 
The announcement appeared to represent a political victory for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who launched the purge last November and predicted at the time that it would net about $100 billion in settlements. 
Dozens of top officials and businessmen were detained in the crackdown, many of them confined and interrogated at Riyadh's opulent Ritz-Carlton Hotel. 
Well over 100 detainees are believed to have been released.
Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, owner of global investor Kingdom Holding, and Waleed al-Ibrahim, who controls influential regional broadcaster MBC, were freed last weekend.
""The estimated value of settlements currently stands at more than 400 billion riyals ($106 billion) represented in various types of assets, including real estate, commercial entities, securities, cash and other assets,"" Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb said in a statement. 
The huge sum, if it is successfully recovered, would be a big financial boost for the government, which has seen its finances strained by low oil prices. The state budget deficit this year is projected at 195 billion riyals. 
In total, the investigation subpoenaed 381 people, some of whom testified or provided evidence, Mojeb said, adding that 56people had not reached settlements and were still in custody, down from 95 early last week. 
The government has generally declined to reveal details of the allegations against detainees or their settlements, making it impossible to be sure how much corruption has been punished or whether the $100 billion figure is realistic.
The only settlement disclosed so far was a deal by senior prince Miteb bin Abdullah to pay more than $1 billion, according to Saudi officials. Miteb was once seen as a leading contender for the throne, so his detention fueled suspicion among foreign diplomats there might be political motives behind the purge.
Although officials said both Prince Alwaleed and Ibrahim reached financial settlements after admitting unspecified ""violations"", Prince Alwaleed continued to insist publicly he was innocent, while MBC said Ibrahim had been fully exonerated.
Economy minister Mohammed al-Tuwaijri told CNN this month that most assets seized in the purge were illiquid, such as real estate and structured financial instruments. That suggested the government may not have gained large sums of cash to spend.
In another sign that the investigation was winding down, a Saudi official told Reuters on Tuesday that all detainees had now left the Ritz-Carlton. The hotel, where the cheapest room costs $650 a night, is to reopen to the public in mid-February.
Some detainees are believed to have been moved from the hotel to prison after refusing to admit wrongdoing and reach financial settlements; they may stand trial.
Bankers in the Gulf said the secrecy of the crackdown had unsettled the business community and could weigh on the willingness of local and foreign businesses to invest.
“It’s reassuring if this situation is finally at an end, as the process was not clear from the start and at least if it is now ended, that provides some clarity and closure,"" said a banker who deals with Saudi Arabia.
But Prince Mohammed appears to have won widespread approval for the purge among ordinary Saudis, partly because the government has said it will use some of the money it seizes to fund social benefits.
""What has happened is great, it will be counted as a win for the government. Whoever the person is, he is being held accountable, whether a royal or a citizen,"" said Abdullah al-Otaibi, drinking at a Riyadh coffee shop on Tuesday.
An international financier visiting the region said authorities' tough approach might ultimately prove effective.
""There are many different ways to fight corruption and not all of them are effective. Ukraine tried to do it by creating institutions, but that hasn’t really worked as that approach doesn’t change behavior,"" he said.

""Saudi’s approach stands a better chance of being effective as it’s more direct.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis is sending the Catholic Church's top investigator into sexual abuse by clergy to Chile to probe a bishop accused of covering up crimes against minors, in a remarkable turnaround only days after the pope defended him.
A Vatican statement on Tuesday said new information had emerged about Bishop Juan Barros and that Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta would go to ""listen to those who want to submit elements in their possession"".
The statement, which gave no details, was stunning U-turn for the pope, who on Jan. 21 told reporters aboard his plane returning from Latin America he was sure Barros was innocent and that the Vatican had received no concrete evidence against him.
It was Scicluna who doggedly uncovered evidence of sexual abuse that led to the removal of the late Mexican priest Marcial Maciel, founder of the Legionaries of Christ, in 2005.
Controversy over Barros, bishop of the city of Osorno in Chile's south, dominated Francis' recent trip, with critics accusing the pope of not understanding the depth of the crisis in the South American country and of dismissing his accusers.
Barros has been accused of protecting his former mentor, the Rev. Fernando Karadima, who was found guilty in a Vatican investigation in 2011 of abusing teenage boys over many years. Karadima denies the allegations, and Barros said he was unaware of any wrongdoing.
Barros and his main accusers were not available to comment on the latest twist of a long-running saga that has gripped Chile and severely hurt the Church's prestige there.
During the trip, a Chilean reporter managed to get close to the pope at an event and shouted out a question about Barros.
""The day I see proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk. There is not a single piece of evidence against him. It is all slander. Is that clear?"" the pope replied in a snippy tone.
His comments were seen as trying to dismiss the credibility of accusers and was widely criticized by victims, their advocates and newspaper editorials in Chile and the pope's native Argentina.
Even Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston, a key papal adviser on how to root out sexual abuse in the Church, distanced himself with a statement saying the pope had caused ""great pain"".
Speaking to reporters on the plane returning to Rome, Francis, in an extremely rare act of self-criticism, apologized to victims, acknowledging that his choice of words and tone of voice had ""wounded many"".
One of Barros' accusers, Juan Carlo Cruz, has said the bishop was present when Karadima abused him. He said he was shocked that the Vatican had said it had no evidence against the bishop.
""As if I could have taken a selfie or photo while Karadima abused me and others with Juan Barros standing next to him watching everything,"" he tweeted on Jan. 18, during the pope's visit. 
Victims and their advocates have said Francis should never have appointed Barros because there had been accusations against him. Anti-Barros parishioners demonstrated during his investiture ceremony in 2015.
While the pope, who met two victims in Chile during the trip, has vowed ""zero tolerance"" of sexual abuse, a planned Vatican tribunal to judge bishops accused of covering up abuse or mishandling cases has never started.

The much-touted commission O'Malley heads has meanwhile been hit by defections by high-profile non-clerical members who quit in frustration over what they said was lack of progress.

433,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 10:15AM ET</span>",Egypt's ex-army officers pose growing security threat,"CAIRO (Reuters) - In October, Emad al-Din Abdel Hamid, a former army commando who had embraced Islamist violence, led a desert ambush against Egyptian police.
His decision illustrates a growing threat from ex-officers ready to turn their guns on the security forces.
Abdel Hamid, whose group Ansar al-Islam claimed the attack and hailed him as one of their leaders, was later killed in a retaliatory air strike. But his death has not discouraged more army officers and police from joining Ansar, three Egyptian security sources said.
The October attack was the group's first public claim, and the first appearance of the name Ansar al-Islam.
But the group, with links to al Qaeda, has history. It is part of an unnamed network that Egyptian security officials have accused of trying to assassinate a former interior minister in 2013 and of killing the country's top prosecutor in a car bomb two years later.
Today, Egypt is also battling Islamic State in the North Sinai region. Hundreds of soldiers have been killed there since 2013, when Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a former army chief who is now president, seized power and vowed to crush Islamist militancy.
The shadowy network that Ansar is part of presents a more daunting national security challenge than the Sinai militants, intelligence officials say, since it is comprised of army officers and policemen who use their training in counter-terrorism and surveillance to attack the forces they once served.
""They're more dangerous than those in Sinai even though they're fewer in number,"" one security source said.
The interior ministry, which oversees the police, did not respond to requests for comment.
The military has also not commented. Sisi appointed a new military chief of staff a week after the attack and the interior ministry dismissed several high-ranking officials in an apparent reorganization of the country's security command.
The three Egyptian security sources said that in recent months up to 30 more captains and lieutenants in the security forces have joined the Ansar network, which is headed by one of the country's most wanted men, former special forces officer Hisham al-Ashmawy.
""They've got stronger,"" an officer in Egypt's National Security service told Reuters. ""New numbers have joined, they have new weapons ... they focus only on big operations, so they don't use up manpower or firepower.""
Ashmawy has been mounting a recruiting campaign in recent years and that is now beginning to bear fruit in terms of numbers joining, two of the security sources said.
Like the other officials interviewed, they requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Egypt has had to contend with Islamist sympathizers in the armed forces for years. In 1981, army officers assassinated President Anwar Sadat, whose rapprochement with Israel angered much of the Arab world. U.S. prosecutors say Seif al-Adel, a former army colonel, helped al Qaeda plan bomb attacks against American embassies in East Africa in 1998.
In recent months, hundreds of members of the security forces have been discharged because of their political or religious affiliations, the security officials said. Reasons for dismissing officers included refusal to arrest protesters at a demonstration or anti-government social media posts.
Sisi faces a presidential election in March, but the political effect of the violence may be limited. The main opposition candidates have withdrawn, and in any case many Egyptians say they are angrier about soaring living costs than about militant attacks.
BIG IMPACT
Only about a dozen heavily armed Ansar militants were needed to lure a police convoy into the Western Desert ambush on Oct. 20, a survivor of the attack said. 
""We fell into a trap. We followed banana and orange peels discarded by militants, thinking they'd got careless and left traces,"" an officer who survived the attack said.
Three security sources told Reuters at the time of the attack that dozens of police officers and conscripts were killed. But the interior ministry denied that figure the next day and said 16 police and conscripts died, including some high-ranking officers.
Two sources in Egypt's General Intelligence Service said Ansar al-Islam had likely known about the police's movements in advance.
""We have information that Ashmawy was able to get hold of devices or somehow listen in on a network that officers use,"" one of the sources said.
The communications network had been secured in the months before the ambush with new wireless technology used only by the National Security branch, he said, so Ashmawy either ""had a way of bugging it, or had got hold of one of the new devices.""
The security sources said Ashmawy recruits selectively, usually via a network of former officers operating in small cells. But Ashmawy and Abdel Hamid's path to jihad is familiar to military intelligence officials.
Both graduated from Egypt's military academy in 1999, according to Abdel Hamid's family, and spent time in a special forces unit called Sa'aika, or Thunderbolt.
They were discharged in 2007 and 2006, respectively, after the army saw they had become more religiously observant.
Both men disappeared and became jihadists in the years of chaos that followed Egypt's 2011 Arab Spring uprising, according to Abdel Hamid's family.
Abdel Hamid came from a long family line of military and police. He became radicalized nonetheless, raising the suspicions of intelligence agents.
""He had started reading more deeply into religion,"" his mother, Sohair al-Gohary, said at the family home in Alexandria.
The army locked Abdel Hamid up for a month after he was found carrying Islamic books. In 2006 he was transferred to a civilian service job for several years, his brother Alaa Abdel Hamid said.
Abdel Hamid divorced, married a woman who wore the Islamic face veil, and then disappeared in 2013, relatives said, days before the Ashmawy network carried out its failed assassination attempt on the interior minister.
LAST WORDS
Abdel Hamid's family heard nothing of him until he was killed by Egyptian warplanes two weeks after the Western Desert ambush. Alaa recalled his brother's last words to him in 2013.

""He said: how can I serve in a military that tries me (for religious piety) ... or live in a country that doesn't follow God's law?""
During the October ambush, Abdel Hamid's skill at arms could be clearly seen, a policeman caught up in the firefight said. 
""I saw Emad shoot an officer in the head from a distance even though the officer was taking cover behind a car,"" the policeman told Reuters, recalling the incident.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's would-be coalition parties reached a compromise on the divisive question of family reunions for migrants on Tuesday, clearing a major hurdle in talks on a ruling alliance, although both sides immediately presented varying interpretations of it.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) are in talks to end a four-month political impasse and agree a deal within a week to rule Europe's biggest economy together.
Migration, and in particular the question of family reunions, is one of the thorniest issues. 
Under the agreement, a suspension of family re-unifications introduced in 2016 for migrants with ""subsidiary protection"" will be extended until July 31. That applies to people who are not deemed to be personally persecuted but in whose home country war, torture or other inhumane treatment exist. 
Syrians, the biggest group of asylum applicants in Germany, are increasingly being granted subsidiary protection, only getting the right to stay a year, although that can be extended.
The lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, will vote on the extension on Thursday as the suspension is due to expire.
From Aug. 1, up to 1,000 family members a month will be permitted to join people who are allowed to stay in Germany on less than full refugee status. That agreement tallies with a blueprint agreed in exploratory talks earlier this month. 
The conservatives, especially Merkel's Bavarian allies, did not want to give way to a more generous policy.
However, SPD party leader Martin Schulz hailed the agreement, saying he had won a concession from the conservatives that meant that more than 1,000 individuals a month would be allowed to enter Germany in cases of special hardship.
That would be an addition to the framework agreement which SPD delegates voted narrowly in favor of last week. Under pressure from the narrow result, the party's leaders promised to improve that document.
""The SPD has held sway, as the SPD party conference demanded, in getting a significant additional provision for special hardship cases, beyond the 1,000 family members a month agreed in the exploratory talks,"" said Schulz.
In a foretaste of the tensions that are likely to emerge in the coming days, conservatives played down any extra leeway. 
""There are no new rules on special cases, which would mean an increase in migration,"" said Bavarian conservative Alexander Dobrindt.
Other difficult areas coming up include employment and health policy. The parties also have still to carve up ministerial posts.
Even if the parties hammer out a deal over the weekend or early next week, as planned, Merkel's fourth term as chancellor is not guaranteed until the SPD's roughly 440,000 members have approved it in a ballot. The outcome is unclear.

The party's leaders are keenly aware they have to win further concessions to reassure members who are deeply skeptical about joining Merkel for a re-run of the ""grand coalition"" that has ruled Germany since 2013.

Madikizela-Mandela was admitted to Johannesburg's Milpark Hospital around 10 days ago. She has been in and out of hospital since 2016 for back and knee surgery.
""I'm pleased to be going back home where I'll be able to rest and fully recuperate from the short illness,"" the statement quoted Madikizela-Mandela as saying.

During her ex-husband's 27-year imprisonment for his fight against apartheid, Madikizela-Mandela campaigned for his release and the rights of black South Africans, undergoing arrest and banishment. White minority rule ended in 1994.

436,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",Thai PM calls for a little more time in office to prepare for vote,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Tuesday he needed a little more time in office to prepare the country for a general election, just days after his deputy said a vote planned for this year could be delayed.
Prayuth, installed as prime minister in August 2014 after leading a coup that ousted a civilian government, has delayed the date of a general election several times. Most recently, he said an election would take place in November.
But last week Thailand's parliamentary body voted to postpone enforcement of a new election law by 90 days, dragging out the time frame. At the time, the deputy prime minister said parliament's decision could delay the election until 2019.
""Please give me some time to lay the foundation for the country, that's all,"" Prayuth told reporters after a weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday. ""The length of this time depends on the law,"" he said, referring to last week's parliamentary decision. Prayuth did not give further details.
He is under pressure at home and abroad to return to civilian governance. 
On Saturday, activists demanding an election this year gathered at a pedestrian bridge in central Bangkok in a rare show of dissent. 
On Tuesday deputy police chief Srivara Ransibrahmanakul said the ruling junta, formally known as the National Council for Peace and Order, had filed a complaint with police against seven leaders of Saturday's protest.
The activists will be charged with crimes including sedition and violating a junta order that bans public gatherings of more than five people, local media reported.
Government critics say the junta is deliberately delaying the vote in order to tighten its grip on power in the Southeast Asian country by ensuring that its allies win the vote.
Some critics say Prayuth would like to stay in power after a general election. Thailand's new constitution, which took effect last year, allows for an appointed prime minister.
Others have warned the junta needs to return Thailand to civilian rule within its promised time frame or risk fanning flames of discontent.
Prayuth addressed questions about waning public support.

""This is normal. Any government in their third year all encounter this,"" he said on Tuesday.

437,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",Macron minister refuses to quit over rape charge he denies,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron's budget minister, targeted by a rape accusation he denies, will not resign, his lawyer said on Tuesday.
The case concerning 35-year-old minister Gerald Darmanin and an encounter dating back to 2009 could test Macron's ability to reconcile the principle of innocence unless proven guilty with his pledges of exemplary government.
Following the sex scandal surrounding U.S. movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, it also comes at a time of heightened demand for action against predatory sexual behavior or abuse of power for sexual favors.
Lawyer Pierre-Olivier Sur spoke in defense of Darmanin after confirmation on Saturday that the rape accusation had triggered the opening of a preliminary judicial inquiry, a step in France where investigators assess whether a complaint merits pursuit.
""There's absolutely no question of that happening,"" Sur said when asked in an RTL radio interview if the minister would stand down.
Darmanin, a high-flyer who joined France's main right-wing party, Les Republicains, in his teens, changed camps last year to join Macron's government. 
His former party was on the front line of those demanding he quit, while other lawmakers have warned against a witch-hunt and said the investigation should run its course. 
The rape accusation was first lodged shortly after he joined Macron's government but shelved after the plaintiff failed to meet investigators. The case was reopened on Jan. 22 after she told investigators she was ready to answer their questions.
Pending the outcome of the preliminary probe, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and other colleagues have said their house rule is that ministers must resign if targeted by a full-blown inquiry. That is not the case right now.
In France, most legal complaints give rise to a preliminary inquiry. The issue is then dropped or a formal investigation begun, which can lead to trial.
Darmanin denied the allegation earlier this year.
His lawyer Sur said the minister acknowledged spending time with his accuser but that the rape accusation was a ""scam"". He said Darmanin would sue for grave slander.
The timing is sensitive, not just because the case may test perception of Macron's promise of squeaky-clean government but also because of the global outcry triggered by accusations of serial sexual harassment by Weinstein.

That scandal also revives memories in France of ex-IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who settled financially with a New York hotel maid who accused him of sexual assault in 2011, ending his presidential ambitions and prompting much soul-searching about the sexual escapades of France's powerful men.

Athens says Skopje's use of ""Macedonia"" as its name could imply a territorial claim over the northern Greek province of the same name, and a claim to its national heritage. Skopje counters that Macedonia has been its name dating to the now defunct Yugoslav federation of which it was part.
The 25-year-long dispute has posed an obstacle to Macedonia's ambition to join both the EU and NATO. 
""Everyone knows what the issues are. There is a time for decision-making, and I think we are there,"" said Matthew Nimetz, U.N. special envoy on the ""Macedonia"" dispute since 1999.
""I know the (Greek) government is very sincere and energized to reach a solution to the problem ... I think there is a will here, and I think also in Skopje, to try to reach a settlement,"" he told reporters in Athens.
The two countries recently agreed to intensify talks. Still, there is mounting public sentiment in Greece against any deal which could include the name Macedonia. Greece has said a compromise could include a compound name with a geographical or chronological qualifier, and be known only by that name.
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has so far failed to secure broad backing from political parties for a settlement which would include the contentious name. 
""I think waiting, slowing things down doesn't make any sense. Here it doesn't make any sense, and in the northern neighbor it doesn't make any sense (either),"" Nimetz said. 
Athens may submit an outline of its proposals to Skopje and the United Nations next month, Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias told state television on Monday night.

Until the issue is resolved, Greece has agreed only that its Balkan neighbor be referred to internationally as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), the name under which it was admitted to the United Nations in 1993, two years after Skopje won independence from Yugoslavia.

Rough sleeper Christopher Parker had been in the train station next to the Manchester Arena when a suicide bomber detonated a device in the foyer at the end of a concert by U.S. singer Ariana Grande. The 22 victims included seven children while more than 500 were injured.
Afterwards Parker, 33, told reporters he had rushed into the venue following the blast, comforting a badly injured girl who had lost both her legs and cradling a woman with serious head and leg wounds who died in his arms. 
His story drew praise in the media and widespread public sympathy with a crowdfunding page raising more than 52,000 pounds ($73,000) to help him.
However, he was sentenced to four years and three months in jail at Manchester Crown Court on Tuesday having admitted at an earlier hearing that he had stolen a purse from a woman and a mobile phone from a 14-year-old girl, both of whom had been seriously injured in the attack.
He also pleaded guilty to fraud for later using a bank card in the stolen purse at a restaurant.
""Christopher Parker entered Manchester Arena in the immediate aftermath of the explosion,"" said Ben Southam from the Crown Prosecution Service.
""It was a devastating and distressing scene, and while he did offer some comfort and assistance to a number of victims who had been injured by the bomb, the evidence showed he was also looking for opportunities to take advantage of the situation.""

Sitting in an old people's center, talk turns to the impact on their healthcare.
""Services used to be very good in the beginning ... They gave us medication and hospital admissions,"" says the 63-year-old. ""But now with this donor funding cut for the Palestinians, our situation in the camps is very bad."" 
Barred from taking up most jobs in Lebanon, the refugees depend on the United Nations Refugee Works Association (UNRWA) for basic services.
But the United States, historically the agency's biggest donor, said this month it would withhold more than half of the $125 million it had planned to give, amid a widening rift between U.S. President Donald Trump and Palestinian leaders.
Trump, stung by Palestinian condemnation of his decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, had days earlier questioned the value of such funding.
Last week, he threatened again to withhold aid to the Palestinians if they did not pursue peace with Israel, accusing them of snubbing the United States by not meeting Vice President Mike Pence during a recent visit.
News of Trump's speech at the World Economic Forum in the snowy Swiss resort of Davos spread quickly through the dusty lanes of Burj al-Barajneh in the southern suburbs of Beirut.
UNRWA is already facing a financial crisis and in Lebanon has had to adjust to the arrival of 30,000 more Palestinian refugees fleeing camps in war-torn Syria. 
""It's extremely tough to be a Palestinian refugee this day. For one thing, there is no prospect of political solution any time soon and the living conditions are tough,"" said Claudio Cordone, head of UNRWA in Lebanon.
""Anything that takes away any support that we are giving them would have a major serious impact on the day to day life,"" he added when asked about the impact of the aid cut.
FUNDING CRISIS
UNRWA was formed in 1949 after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war that followed Israel's creation. 
Laila al-Mughrabi, another woman at the old people's center, can remember leaving her home in Acre as a young Palestinian girl. For much of the seven decades since then she has lived in the Burj al-Barajneh. 
""We were living near the sea, near the fortress. We lived there and were born there and raised there. Then Israel came and the attacks and shelling. We started to flee,"" she says. 
Burj al-Barajneh is off a main road in south Beirut, where Palestinian flags and posters of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat hang as bunting and are pasted to walls. UNRWA has registered almost 18,000 Palestinian refugees there.
In the warren of alleys behind the camp's narrow main road, the ways are too small for cars and a thick canopy of tangled electrical wires and water pipes blocks out the light.
""As Palestinians, we are in catastrophe. We barely gather food for our children and there is no work,"" Nassar says.
Nearby, a steady flow of people - old and young - attend an UNRWA clinic. A woman with a baby on her shoulder stands waiting while a doctor walks along a corridor in a white lab coat and pink headscarf. 
UNRWA has launched a global campaign for countries and private donors to help it deal with a shortfall in funding.

""We have a clear mandate, which is a humanitarian mandate. We need to support, through schools, through health, through other services, a very vulnerable population here in Lebanon and the other countries where UNRWA operates. We are determined to continue to do that,"" said Cordone.

Montenegro's coastal security sent out a rescue team after Erica, a 15 metre-long (50 feet) vessel, put out a distress signal 17 nautical miles (31 km) off the coast, said Safet Kocan, director of maritime safety. 
The Italian ship with migrants on board was finally moored in the Montenegrin port of Zelenika, inside the Boka Kotorska bay. 
Police said there were 11 Syrian nationals on the vessel, two people from Morocco and two from Yemen, one person from Afghanistan and one from Pakistan. The group included four children.
""The distress call was sent this morning ... by the Italian fishing vessel Erica seeking assistance as it was transporting 17 people and was facing danger of sinking,"" a police statement said.
""According to findings, Erica's crew had previously aided these people by picking them up from a small inflatable boat in international waters.""
Unlike its neighbors Serbia and Croatia, Montenegro, a small Adriatic nation has so far been largely spared from an inflow of hundreds of thousands of migrants from the Middle East, Africa and Asia, which in 2016 and 2016 poured across the Balkans, heading to the West. 
The so-called 'Balkan route', was shut in 2016 when Turkey agreed to stem the flow of people in return for EU aid and a promise of visa-free travel for its own citizens.
It was not clear how the migrant group had managed to bypass Italy, a common destination for migrants.
Montenegro may have been the only convenient place to disembark after the group drifted into the Adriatic through the Otranto pass separating Italy and Albania.

442,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 08:33AM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S., Mexico explore placing armed U.S. air marshals on flights","By Gabriel Stargardter
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico and the United States are looking into whether armed U.S. federal air marshals could be deployed on commercial cross-border flights, according to a document seen by Reuters and a Mexican official, as Mexico deepens security ties with its neighbor. 
Since Donald Trump took office, U.S and Mexican officials have said that Mexico has tried to improve cooperation with its top trade partner on security, immigration, and foreign policy, hoping to convince the U.S. president to take a softer stance on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
In 2003, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on the United States, Mexico agreed to place Mexican security agents on certain flights, but said it would never allow U.S. officials on board its commercial airlines, let alone armed.
However, in a Jan. 18 meeting in Mexico's foreign ministry, officials from both countries agreed to ""study the convenience of negotiating an agreement for the deployment of Federal Air Marshals on commercial flights,"" according to the official Mexican document seen by Reuters.
U.S. Federal Air Marshal Service spokesman Thomas Kelly declined to answer questions on the proposed agreement, but said air marshals ""are armed Federal Law Enforcement Officers with the mission of in-flight protection of U.S.-flagged aircraft, crewmembers and passengers.""
In a statement, Mexico's foreign ministry confirmed that the government is evaluating the plan's potential operational and security benefits but added that no agreement has yet been reached.
A Mexican official with knowledge of the plan said the hardest part of the negotiations would center on allowing U.S. officials to carry arms, given that the use of weapons by foreigners in Mexico is sensitive and tightly regulated. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) places sharp-shooters on domestic and international commercial flights to and from the United States to prevent militant attacks. 
The Mexican official said it was still to be decided if the air marshals would fly on just U.S.-bound flights, Mexico-bound flights, or both. There is no set date for when the agreement might be struck, or come into effect, the official said. 
It was not immediately clear if the marshals would travel solely on U.S.-owned airlines or also on Mexican carriers.
The document shows that Mexico and the United States have agreed to several other security measures to tackle ""transnational criminal organizations.""
The two countries plan to create a bilateral investigative body for probing international criminal groups.
There are also plans to negotiate a maritime drug seizures treaty, and use ships and radars for specific operations. The two nations also want to deepen efforts to eradicate opium and marijuana plantations. 
Additionally, the document showed that Mexico and the United States agreed ""to identify specific transnational criminal organizations, map their business models in both countries and design a joint operational strategy to combat them.""
NAFTA CONCERNS
The foreign ministry has pushed hard to defend NAFTA ahead of a July 2018 election in which the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party is currently polling third. 
Mexico, Canada and the United States are currently in the midst of fraught negotiations to reshape NAFTA, a lynchpin of the Mexican economy that Trump has threatened to abandon.
Trump's trade chief rejected Canadian proposals for unblocking NAFTA modernization talks on Monday but pledged to seek ""breakthroughs"" by late February, easing concerns that Washington would soon withdraw from the trilateral pact.
Many in the Mexican government believe a U.S. NAFTA exit before the July election would strengthen the challenge of leftist front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who some in Washington view as a threat to bilateral cooperation.
Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said in September that he views cooperation with the United States as the best way to achieve Mexico's foreign policy aims. 
Mexico bolstered anti-narcotics collaboration last year as U.S. concern mounted over heroin-related deaths, inviting U.S. officials to inspect the army's opium poppy eradication efforts. Mexico's army has long been wary of U.S. intrusion in its affairs.

Mexico has also hewed closer to the United States on sensitive foreign policy issues including Venezuela, North Korea, Israel and Honduras.

Deniz Naki, 28, was banned from all competitive games for three years and six months and charged 273,000 liras ($72,000) for ""separatist and ideological propaganda"", the TFF said.
Procedurally, any suspension longer than three years in Turkey constitutes a life ban, meaning Naki will not be able to play soccer in the country again.
Naki shared a video on social media on Sunday calling for participation in a rally in the German city of Cologne to protest against Turkey's military offensive into northern Syria's Afrin region.
Turkish authorities have cracked down on public expressions of dissent about the ground offensive against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia. More than 300 people have been detained for social media posts criticizing the campaign and a prosecutor has issued detention warrants for 11 top doctors.
On Saturday, German magazine Der Spiegel, citing Naki's lawyer, said the player wanted to terminate his contract with his Turkey-based team Amedspor due to security concerns and intended to stay in Germany.
Naki, who was given an 18-month suspended sentence in April for ""terrorist propaganda"" in support of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), said this month that he feared he had been attacked for his views after shots were fired at his car in Germany.
About 40,000 people have been killed since the PKK took up arms against the Turkish state for autonomy in the country's largely Kurdish southeast. The PKK is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.

BETHLEHEM, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinians protesting against U.S. President Donald Trump's policy on Jerusalem halted a U.S.-coordinated Palestinian marketing workshop in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, damaging an American diplomatic vehicle as it sped away.
Protesters threw tomatoes at the sports utility vehicle, which had U.S. consular license plates. They also kicked one of its doors and ripped the plastic casing off a side mirror as it drove off under Palestinian police escort from the Bethlehem Chamber of Commerce.
Samir Hazboun, the chamber's director, told Reuters that a digital marketing workshop, which the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem helped to organize, was under way when about five protesters barged in.
""We hosted an American expert on this issue. Some people who have been trying to express their point of view and protest (against) the American decision regarding Jerusalem and the political situation ... interrupted the workshop and we stopped the workshop,"" Hazboun said.
Commenting on the incident, a State Department spokesperson said: ""The United States opposes the use of violence and intimidation to express political views. This non-political program was one part of long-term U.S. engagement to create economic opportunities for Palestinians.""
The U.S.-based lecturer was not a consular staff member. He was accompanied by consular security personnel and some of its Palestinian employees, organizers said.
Trump's Dec. 6 announcement recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital overturned decades of U.S. policy that its status should be decided in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
His declaration drew universal condemnation from Arab leaders, stirred Palestinian street protests and drew widespread international criticism.
On a visit to Israel last week, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said that Trump's promised relocation of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would take place by the end of 2019. Palestinians boycotted Pence's visit.
Israel's government regards Jerusalem as the eternal and indivisible capital of the country, although that is not recognized internationally. Palestinians say East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in a 1967 war, must be the capital of a state they seek in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
In the Aida refugee camp near Bethlehem on Saturday, effigies of Trump and Pence were hanged and burned in a protest attended by about 30 Palestinians.

LONDON (Reuters) - Instead of blaming others Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should take responsibility for Iran's economic and political shortcomings, an opposition leader under house arrest said in a letter published on Tuesday.
In rare public criticism of Khamenei, Mehdi Karroubi accused Iran's hardline top authority of abusing power and urged him to change the way he runs the Islamic Republic before it is too late.
""You have been Iran's top leader for three decades, but still speak like an opposition,"" Karroubi said in an open letter to Khamenei published on Saham News, the official website of his reformist political party.
By ""opposition"", Karroubi meant that Khamenei, head of a Shi'ite theocracy, should not be wielding ultimate power while criticizing the government of elected President Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist who wants to liberalize an economy dominated by the elite Revolutionary Guards and other state conglomerates. 
""During the last three decades, you have eliminated the main revolutionary forces to implement your own policies, and now you should face the results of that,"" Karroubi added.
Karroubi, 80, a Shi'ite cleric like Khamenei, and fellow reformist Mirhossein Mousavi ran for election in 2009 and became figureheads for Iranians who staged mass protests after hardline conservative President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was returned to power in a vote they believed was rigged. Authorities denied this. 
Karroubi, Mousavi and the latter's wife Zahra Rahnavard have been under house arrest since 2011 without trial, by the direct order of Khamenei.
The Supreme Leader is commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces and appoints the heads of the judiciary. Key cabinet ministers are selected with his approval and he has the ultimate say on Iran’s foreign policy and nuclear program.
By comparison, the president wields little power.
Karroubi also criticized Khamenei for letting the Revolutionary Guards take a commanding role in the economy as this ""has tarnished the reputation of this revolutionary body and drowned it in massive corruption"".
KARROUBI CITES UNACCOUNTABLE ELITE
He said that under Khamenei's leadership, bodies formed at the beginning of the 1979 Revolution to wipe out poverty had turned into conglomerates that own half of Iran's wealth without a supervisory organization to question their actions.
More than 10 million Iranians, among 80 million, now live in absolute poverty, Karroubi said quoting official figures.
""Under such conditions, it is natural that the lower classes, who were the grassroot supporters of the Islamic Revolution, will turn into a gunpowder barrel,"" Karroubi said.
Khamenei has often accused Rouhani's government of responsibility for the lack of headway toward reducing high unemployment, inflation and inequality. He has also blamed members of parliament, former presidents and Western powers.
Rouhani, however, was easily re-elected in 2017, suggesting many Iranians still see him as their best hope for improving the economy and easing religious restrictions on society. 
Karroubi further said December's nationwide street protests against ""corruption and discrimination"" were an alarm bell for the authorities to reform the economic and political system. 
Goaded by soaring food prices, the protests - the biggest in Iran since the post-election unrest of 2009 - took on a rare political dimension, with a growing number of people calling on Khamenei himself to step down.
Clashes between protesters and police resulted in 25 deaths, according to official figures.
Karroubi also said that by vetting candidates in elections, Khamenei had reduced parliament to ""an obedient assembly"" under his thumb and the influence of Revolutionary Guards lobbies.
The Assembly of Experts, a council of elected clerics charged with electing, supervising and even disqualifying the Supreme Leader, has turned into a ""ceremonial council that only praises the Leader"", Karroubi added.
Karoubi, an ex-speaker of parliament, has been accused by hardline authorities of being a ""seditionist"" and ""traitor"". 

In a public letter to Rouhani in 2016, he asked ""the despotic regime"" to grant him a public trial so he could hear the indictment against him and defend himself.

""The estimated value of settlements currently stands at more than 400 billion riyals ($106 billion) represented in various types of assets, including real estate, commercial entities, securities, cash and other assets,"" Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb said in a statement.
The huge sum, if it is successfully recovered, would be a major financial boost for the government, which has seen its finances strained by low oil prices. The state budget deficit this year is projected at 195 billion riyals.
The announcement also appeared to represent a political victory for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who launched the purge last November and predicted at the time that it would net about $100 billion in settlements.
Dozens of top officials and businessmen were detained in the purge, many of them confined and interrogated at Riyadh's opulent Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
In total, the investigation subpoenaed 381 people, some of whom testified or provided evidence, Mojeb said, adding that 56 people had not reached settlements and were still in custody, down from 95 early last week. Some cases are expected to go for trial, authorities have said previously.

Over 100 detainees are believed to have been released. Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, owner of global investor Kingdom Holding, and Waleed al-Ibrahim, who controls influential regional broadcaster MBC, were freed last weekend.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan authorities shut down television and radio stations on Tuesday as supporters of opposition leader Raila Odinga watched him take a symbolic presidential oath on the Bible in a Nairobi park in a direct challenge to President Uhuru Kenyatta.
Odinga's supporters insist that he, not Kenyatta, is Kenya's legitimate leader, and that Kenyatta's election was neither free nor fair. 
Kenyatta's election victory in August was annulled by the Supreme Court over irregularities, but he then won a re-run, which Odinga boycotted over a failure to revamp the electoral commission, and was sworn in for a second term in November.
""I, Raila Omolo Odinga, do swear that I will protect the nation as people's president, so help me God,"" Odinga said to the cheers of more than 10,000 people in Uhuru Park, near Nairobi's main business district.
The attorney-general had warned that Odinga could be charged with treason if the event went ahead - an offence that can carry the death penalty. 
As people assembled, authorities had begun to force independent television and radio stations reporting on the gathering off air, several outlets said - the most widespread censorship for a decade.
""We have an illegitimate government which is pretending to be in power,"" Odinga told a local broadcaster by phone in an interview that was streamed online. ""Whenever there is a crisis, there is also an opportunity. This is an opportunity to bring the country together."" 
Odinga refused to be drawn on his plans for after his symbolic inauguration, repeatedly telling the interviewer, ""Hold your horses"" and ""We'll see"". 
Many of the protesters were chanting pro-Odinga slogans, waving tree branches and blowing horns and whistles.
""Odinga is the one we recognize as the president and that is why we are swearing him in,"" said hairdresser Benta Akinyi, 32.
Many of those at the rally had come from the capital's slums. Odinga has strong support there, and in the west and along the coast, areas where people have long felt ignored by central government and shut out of political patronage networks. 
""PREVENTABLE CRISIS""
""This is a lose-lose situation for both Kenyatta and Odinga and it was an entirely preventable crisis. It's not clear where Odinga goes next from here,"" said Murithi Mutiga, a senior analyst for the International Crisis Group. 
""Kenyatta as well - by resisting all attempts at dialogue, he has put himself in a position where he will continue to struggle to be seen as the president of all Kenyans."" 
Although the police had said they would prevent any illegal assembly, there were no uniformed police in the park and no anti-riot officers or vehicles were visible. On the edge of the crowd, a single tear gas canister was fired.
Nearly 100 people were killed over the prolonged election period, mostly in clashes between Odinga supporters and police.
The local radio station Capital FM reported that Odinga's supporters had been granted permission to use the park, but police and government spokespeople could not be reached for comment.
""We intend to hold a peaceful event,"" Odinga's NASA alliance said in a statement late on Monday.
""We nonetheless wish to put the (ruling party) Jubilee administration on notice that we will accomplish our mission, come hell or high water. We advise our supporters to come prepared to stay until our mission is accomplished.""
By 10:20 a.m. (0720 GMT), a number of independently owned media outlets including Citizen radio and television, NTV and KTN said that authorities had forced them off air. 
""The Communications Authority of Kenya has switched off Citizen Television and Radio in most parts of the country over the coverage of the NASA 'swearing-in' plan,"" Citizen said on its website. 
A Communications Authority spokeswoman said it would comment later. 

On Monday, Linus Kaikai, chairman of the Kenya Editors' Guild, said editors had been warned by the authorities that they could be shut down if they covered the event.

Fabian Picardo told The Independent newspaper that Gibraltar's constitution gave it the ability to determine which parts of any final divorce deal concluded with the European Union it would keep. 
""We will be able to determine whether aspects of what is agreed will be implemented in Gibraltar or not,"" Picardo said, referring to the constitution of the tiny enclave on the southern tip of Spain known as ""The Rock"". 
""It is clear that we do have a Brexit veto for Gibraltar, in Gibraltar.""
No one from Britain's Brexit department was immediately available for comment.
As Britain negotiates a new trading deal with the EU, there are deep splits across the country about what sort of agreement should be sought with the bloc.
An analysis compiled by British officials which was leaked on Monday suggested that Britain would be worse off under three Brexit scenarios considered. 
Gibraltar, which Spain ceded to Britain in 1713 but wants back, voted 96 percent in favor of staying in the EU in the 2016 referendum and Picardo said the enclave had autonomy in areas including those relating to business and social care, meaning it set different tariffs in some sectors. 
The UK says it will seek a one-size-fits-all trade agreement with the EU which will be applicable to all parts of the UK, despite regional differences.
Gibraltar's stance reflects other divisions within the regions of the United Kingdom. The devolved government in Scotland also wants to retain membership of the EU's single market and customs union and has tried to further the possibility of a differential deal. 

Like Gibraltar, Scotland voted to keep its EU membership while Britain as a whole voted to leave, straining relations between London and Edinburgh.

The prosecutor said police in Ankara had started legal proceedings on Tuesday morning and search-and-detention operations were carried out in several provinces. Media reports said nine of the medics had been detained.
Turkish authorities have cracked down on any expression of dissent over the air and ground offensive against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in Syria's Afrin region. More than 300 people have been detained for social media posts criticizing the campaign since it began 10 days ago.
The association's lawyer Ziynet Ozcelik said that the doctors faced accusations of ""propaganda in support of a terrorist organization, and provoking the public"". Ozcelik said it was the first time in the association's history that all its executive members had been ordered detained.
The association had denounced the cross-border operation into Syria's Afrin last week, saying: ""No to war, peace immediately"". That prompted President Tayyip Erdogan to accuse the union of treason.
""Believe me, they are not intellectuals at all, they are a gang of slaves. They are the servants of imperialism,"" he told AK Party members in the northern province of Amasya on Sunday.
""This 'No to war' cry by this mob ... is nothing other than the outburst of the betrayal in their souls ... This is real filth, this is the honorless stance that should be said 'no' to,"" he said.
Turkey's Health Minister Ahmet Demircan was quoted by Hurriyet newspaper as saying the union had no right to make such a statement and added that the health ministry had filed a lawsuit to have the union's administration removed.
""It (TTB) has made a big mistake. The necessary actions will be taken in accordance with the law,"" Demircan was quoted as saying.
CALL FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
The crackdown on top medics drew swift criticism from an international medical organization and rights group Amnesty International, who called for protection for the members and an immediate end to the legal proceedings.
The World Medical Association (WMA) said its President Yoshitake Yokokura condemned the detentions as well as threats of violence made against the doctors.
""We call on the Turkish authorities to immediately release the physician leaders and to end the campaign of intimidation,"" the WMA, which represents 111 national medical associations across the world, said in a statement.
Amnesty said members of the TTB were ""subjected to threats of violence"", and called on people to submit appeals to the Ankara governor's office to provide additional security measures for the union and its members.

Separately, the Furkan Education and Service Foundation, a group that runs Islamic schools, said several of its members had been arrested. Those detained included the group's Chairman Alparslan Kuytul, who had made remarks deemed to be criticizing Turkey's military offensive.

Prosecutors had set aside the alibi of Russel Salic, who said he was at a doctors' convention in another Philippine province when pro-Islamic State Maute militants kidnapped six sawmill workers and beheaded two of them in April 2016.
""Criminal liability exists, notwithstanding non-participation in every detail in the execution of the crime,"" prosecutors said in a document recommending charges against Salic and Maute militants.
Reuters could not immediately reach Salic, his lawyer or other representatives by telephone or email to seek comment.
The 37 year-old doctor has been detained at a maximum security facility in the capital, Manila, after he surrendered to authorities last year.
In sworn statements, four sawmill workers said that while in captivity, they had seen Salic cleaning guns in a room full of weapons and that he had asked some of the militants to give them food and coffee. 
In his defense, Salic disputed the sawmill workers' story, insisting he was at an orthopedic convention and showing pictures to back up his account. But prosecutors ignored his alibi, saying the workers had no reason to fabricate stories.
At about the time of the 2016 abduction, Salic, who had expressed support for Islamic State on social media, sent about $423 from the Philippines to an FBI undercover officer to help pay for the attacks in New York, documents unsealed in a U.S. federal court show.
U.S. authorities filed criminal charges against the 37-year-old doctor in October last year and wanted him extradited along with Pakistani Talha Haroon, who was also linked to the bomb plot in Manhattan's Times Square (NYSE:SQ).
But Salic could not immediately be sent to the United States because he faced charges of murder and kidnapping, along with 53 other pro-Islamic State militants, in the regional trial court in the southern Philippines.
The justice department said the mother of the Maute brothers who led the militants' takeover of Marawi City for five months from May last year, was also charged. Some of Salic's co-accused had been killed in Marawi, including seven Maute brothers.

Reuters could not immediately reach Omita Maute for comment.

ADEN (Reuters) - Southern Yemeni separatists took control of the port city of Aden after two days of fighting, residents said on Tuesday, confining the internationally-recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to the presidential palace.
Fighting between southern separatists, backed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), against forces loyal to Saudi-based president Hadi, risk crippling their once united campaign against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen's north.
The UAE is a major component of a Saudi-led military coalition of Arab states that has supported Hadi's government since the Houthis seized much of the country, including the capital Sanaa, three years ago. Hadi's government operates out of Aden, while he lives in Saudi Arabia.
Residents said forces loyal to the Southern Transitional Council (STC), formed last year to push for the revival of the former independent state of South Yemen, seized the last stronghold of Hadi's Presidential Protection Forces in the Dar Saad area of northern Aden, in battles that at times involved heavy artillery and tank fire.
Activists shared photos on social media of the flag of the former independent Southern Yemen state flying over the base's gate. Southern Yemen was united with Northern Yemen in 1990.
Aden residents said STC fighters had earlier overrun Presidential Protection forces outposts in central Aden's Crater and Tawahi districts.
They stopped outside the al-Maasheeq palace, where Prime Minister Ahmed bin Daghr's cabinet is based, they said.
Witnesses said hundreds of people danced and sang as they celebrated the STC victory with fireworks that lit the night skies over Aden. The crowd chanted slogans demanding restoration of the southern state.
Mosques also mixed their calls for prayers with victory claims in Crater, residents said.
""ALL MEASURES""
The government-run Saba news agency put the death toll in two days of fighting at 16 and the number of wounded at 141. An official at the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said at least 36 were killed and 185 were wounded.
The fighting began on Sunday after a deadline set last week by the STC for Hadi to dismiss bin Daghr's government, which the STC accused of corruption and mismanagement. The government denies the allegation.
Sources at the STC said negotiations were underway to allow bin Daghr's government to leave the city safely, but a government source said bin Daghr had no intention to leave Aden.
The Saudi-led coalition, which intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 to restore Hadi's government after the Houthis forced him into exile, called in a statement on Tuesday on both parties to cease hostilities.
""The coalition will take all the measures it deems necessary to restore stability and security in Aden,"" it said.
Although Hadi remains in exile in Saudi Arabia, his administration and local allies nominally control about four-fifths of Yemen's territory, although most population centers are in the hands of the Houthis.
The factional fighting in the south compounds the misery of Yemenis whose country has been torn apart by three years of conflict between Hadi's forces and the Houthis, which has also opened the way for Islamist militants to widen their influence.
In the southern Shabwa province, at least 12 soldiers from another local forces trained and backed by the UAE were killed in a bomb and gun attack on their outpost, residents and officials said. 

While no one claimed responsibility for the attack, it mirrored previous operations by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

GENEVA (Reuters) - An estimated 60,000 children face potential starvation in North Korea, where international sanctions are exacerbating the situation by slowing aid deliveries, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on Tuesday.
World powers have imposed growing sanctions on North Korea for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Last week the United States announced fresh sanctions on nine entities, 16 people and six North Korean ships it accused of helping the weapons programs.
Under United Nations Security Council resolutions, humanitarian supplies or operations are exempt from sanctions, Omar Abdi, UNICEF deputy executive director, said.
""But what happens is that of course the banks, the companies that provide goods or ship goods are very careful. They don’t want to take any risk of later on being associated (with) breaking the sanctions,"" Abdi told a news briefing.
""That is what makes it more difficult for us to bring things. So it takes a little bit longer, especially in getting money into the country. But also in shipping goods to DPRK. There are not many shipping lines that operate in that area,"" he said, referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
Sanctions on fuel have been tightened, making it more scarce and expensive, Abdi added.
Reuters, citing three Western European intelligence sources, reported exclusively last week that North Korea shipped coal to Russia last year which was then delivered to South Korea and Japan in a likely violation of U.N. sanctions.
""We are projecting that at some point during the year 60,000 children will become severely malnourished. This is the malnutrition that potentially can lead to death. It's protein and calorie malnutrition,"" said Manuel Fontaine, director of UNICEF emergency programs worldwide.
""So the trend is worrying, it's not getting any better.""
UNICEF had projected 60,000 North Korean children would suffer severe acute malnutrition last year, spokesman Christophe Boulierac said.
""Diarrhoea related to poor sanitation and hygiene and acute malnutrition remains a leading cause of death among young children,"" it said in Tuesday's appeal to donors that gave no toll.
UNICEF is seeking $16.5 million this year to provide nutrition, health and water to North Koreans but faces ""operational challenges"" due to the tense political context and ""unintended consequences"" of sanctions, it said.
It cited ""disruptions to banking channels, delays in clearing relief items at entry ports, difficulty securing suppliers and a 160 percent increase in fuel prices"".
""It's a very close, and tightly monitored intervention which is purely humanitarian in its essence,"" Fontaine said.
UNICEF is one of only a few aid agencies with access to the isolated country, which suffered famine in the mid-1990s that killed up to three million people.

North Korea is the least-reported major emergency worldwide, CARE International said earlier this month. Two in five North Koreans are undernourished, the charity said, citing United Nations statistics.

Uzbekistan-born Rakhmat Akilov, who was on the run from Swedish authorities after his asylum application was turned down, said in online conversations cited by the prosecutor that he wanted to ""run over unbelievers"".
He has been charged with committing a terrorist act and other crimes. Prosecutors have called for a life sentence in a trial due to begin next month.
Akilov had asked in online conversations for practical advice on building a bomb and for spiritual guidance ahead of a ""martyr operation"", the charges filed with a Stockholm court alleged.
In his online correspondence, Akilov discussed Swedish support for NATO and said the country had sent bomb technicians to Iraq to train Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State, the militant group that has been routed from territory it held.
Akilov has admitted killing five people in the attack. His defense lawyer was due to comment on the charges at a news conference at 1200 GMT.
On April 7 last year, Akilov hijacked a beer truck outside a restaurant in central Stockholm and sped some 500 meters (yards) down a pedestrian street, ploughing into shoppers before crashing the truck into a department store. 
Three people - including an 11 year old girl - were killed immediately and two of the dozen injured died later in hospital.

In Sweden, charges are brought after the preliminary investigation is completed and suspects can be held in custody until that time.

Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population but Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra, is the only province that enforces Islamic law and outlaws homosexuality.
Religious police and vigilantes in Aceh often raid homes and places of work and detain people on suspicion of engaging in homosexual activity.
Police in North Aceh district confirmed the raids and detentions of 12 transgender people after residents complained their children were being harassed, the national daily Kompas said. 
""There were mothers who came crying to me, worried about their children,"" said district police chief Ahmad Untung. ""This is not right, and we hope this social disease can be resolved,"" he told the paper.
The suspects were forced to cut their hair to look more ""masculine"" and were later released without charge, media said.
Rights group Amnesty International said the raid showed Aceh had become ""an increasingly hostile place"" for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community.
""The latest raids on beauty salons are just the latest example of the authorities arbitrarily targeting transgender people simply for who they are,"" Usman Hamid of Amnesty International Indonesia said in a statement.
""Cutting the hair of those arrested to 'make them masculine' and forcing them to dress like men are forms of public shaming and amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, in contravention of Indonesia’s international obligations.""
Last year, the provincial and central governments drew international condemnation after authorities in Aceh tried two young men on charges of engaging in gay sex and then publicly caned them - the first such case in the country.
Indonesia's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community has drawn increasing hostility in recent years. Conservative groups and politicians have urged parliament to revise the national criminal code to criminalize same-sex relations.

The tiny former British protectorate, nestled between two Malaysian states on the island of Borneo, relies on oil and gas exports, but is having to grapple with shrinking state revenue as global energy prices have tumbled over the last few years.""I myself am of the opinion that the time has come for a cabinet reshuffle,"" Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, 71, said in a televised address from his palace.
""I have decided to announce new appointments and changes to the cabinet.""
No immediate reason was given for the first cabinet reshuffle since October 2015. It follows the surprise dismissal of the health minister last December.
Cabinet reshuffles typically only happen every five years, but Tuesday’s announcement saw several long-serving cabinet members replaced mid-term, including Second Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Lim Jock Seng, Energy and Industry Minister Yasmin Umar, and Second Finance Minister Rahman Ibrahim. 
Other ministers replaced include the education, development and communications ministers. 
Two women promoted to deputy ministers in the cabinet took on positions in the prime minister’s office and the education ministry.
The sultan, the world’s second-longest reigning monarch, retained the key portfolios of prime minister, defense minister, finance minister and the minister of foreign affairs and trade.
Once declared the world's richest man, the sultan has a firm grip on power in the Muslim-majority country of 400,000 people. 
Brunei does not hold elections but any discontent is assuaged with generous government polices, including zero taxes, subsidized housing and free healthcare and education.

The cabinet reshuffle comes ahead of Brunei’s annual parliamentary session, held every March.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration may be pursuing the development of new nuclear weaponry and could explicitly leave open the possibility of nuclear retaliation for major non-nuclear attacks, according to a draft of a pending Nuclear Posture Review leaked by the Huffington Post.
This ""unprecedented"" move by the United States, combined with continuous quality improvements of nuclear arsenals in both the U.S. and Russia, means that both countries place greater importance on deterrence and real combat usability, the commentary in the PLA Daily said.
""In the roiling unpredictability of today's world, to upgrade the capability of our country's deterrence strategy, to support our great power position... we must strengthen the reliability and trustworthiness of our nuclear deterrence and nuclear counterstrike capabilities,"" it said.
The article was written by two researchers from the PLA Academy of Military Science, a top research institute directly responsible to China's Central Military Commission.
A change was necessary despite China having developed nuclear weapons to avoid bullying from nuclear powers, the paper said, adding that China would always stick to the principle of ""no first use"" and a final goal of eliminating nuclear weapons.
Neither Russia nor the United States is abandoning nuclear weapons as each adopts new high-tech weapons capabilities, the paper said, pointing to the U.S. Congressional Budget Office's estimate of maintenance and modernization of the U.S. nuclear arsenal over the next 30 years costing more than $1.2 trillion.
This spend, the paper said, has led to a corresponding Russian military modernization program, aiming to boost the share of advanced armaments in its nuclear triad to at least 90 percent by 2021.
Chinese President Xi Jinping is overseeing an ambitious military modernization program, including developing advanced nuclear-capable missiles. China carried out its first nuclear weapons test only in 1964.
Trump's strong embrace of his predecessor President Barack Obama's nuclear modernization program has led some former senior U.S. government officials, legislators and arms control specialists to warn of risks from the U.S. stoking a new arms race.

A U.S. national defense strategy released on Jan. 19 shifted priorities to put what Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called a ""great power competition"" with China and Russia at the heart of the country's military strategy.

Under Japan's eugenics protection law, in force from 1948 to 1996, about 25,000 people were sterilized due to mental or genetic illnesses, Japanese media said. They included leprosy sufferers and some with intellectual and cognitive disabilities.
About 16,500 of them are believed to have had the surgery without their consent.
The 60-year-old who sued had developed mental problems following surgery for a cleft palate as an infant and was diagnosed with an intellectual disability at 15, after which she was forcibly sterilized, media said, quoting court documents.
As the result of side-effects she later had to have her ovaries removed. Subsequently, marriage talks were broken off as a result of her inability to have children.
No further details were given, including the woman's name.
""Thanks to the law, my sister has really suffered, living her life hidden away,"" the woman's sister told a news conference.
""We wanted to stand up and build a society where even people with disabilities can have a happy life.""
The woman seeks compensation of 11 million yen ($101,149), saying the government should have set up relief measures for those subjected to the surgery, in recompense for violating their human rights. 
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato declined to comment, telling reporters he did not know the details of the case, but his ministry would investigate.
People with disabilities have long suffered shame and stigma in Japan, although anti-discrimination efforts have gathered pace since a law took effect in 2016.
That July, however, Japan was forced to confront its attitudes after a man went on a stabbing spree at a facility for disabled people near Tokyo, killing 19 as they slept and wounding 26. He had previously threatened to ""obliterate"" disabled people.
Almost nothing about the victims was disclosed except for gender and age, mainly at the request of their families.

Judicial officials have said around 1,000 people were arrested during the week-long protests which spread to around 80 towns and cities across Iran. One lawmaker has put the figure at 3,700.
Sparked by soaring food prices, the protests - the biggest in Iran since nationwide pro-reform unrest in 2009 - took on a rare political dimension, with a growing number of people calling on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down.
Clashes between protesters and police resulted in 25 deaths, according to official figures.

Rahmani Fazli said that in Tehran, only nine people remained in detention. 
The Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based advocacy group, said on Friday some detainees arrested in the protests are facing charges that are punishable by death.
The head of the judiciary, Sadeq Larijani, asked the courts this month to show mercy on those who peacefully protested and only punish those who damaged public properties and ""followed the enemies' orders"".
Several detainees have died in custody. The judiciary has confirmed two such deaths but said these were cases of suicide. Activists say up to five people died in detention and have called for an independent investigation.

Indonesian Siti Aisyah is accused with another woman, Doan Thi Huong from Vietnam, of killing Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a banned chemical poison at Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13 last year.
Defence lawyers say the women thought they were playing pranks for a reality show and did not know they were poisoning Kim. They face the death penalty if convicted.
On Jan. 5 last year, Siti Aisyah was approached at a nightclub by a Malaysian taxi driver, who asked her if she would participate in a Japanese video prank show, her lawyer, Gooi Soon Seng, told the court during his questioning of the lead police investigator in the case, Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz. 
   The following morning the taxi driver, Kamaruddin Masiod, also known as John, introduced Siti Aisyah to Ri Ji U, a North Korean posing as a Japanese man named James, at a shopping mall in Kuala Lumpur's city centre, Gooi added.
After Siti Aisyah agreed to the offer, she watched pranks being played by an unidentified woman, before joining in. She played pranks on three people near a fountain outside the mall entrance and was paid 400 ringgit ($102.70) by Ri at the end of the day, Gooi said.
Wan Azirul, the police witness, was unable to confirm the pranks took place.
""I agree that Kamaruddin was the person who introduced the first accused (Siti Aisyah) to James, but the date and place, I'm not sure,"" Wan Azirul said.
The meeting of Siti Aisyah, Ri and Kamaruddin was captured in a photograph taken at the shopping mall, Gooi said.
The photo was released to reporters after Tuesday's hearing.
   Ri was named by Malaysian police as a suspect shortly after Kim Jong Nam's killing and his photo was released to the media.
Defence lawyers have argued the killing was politically motivated, with many key suspects linked to the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, suggesting the two women were merely unwitting pawns in the attack.
  Pyongyang has denied accusations by South Korean and U.S. officials that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s regime was behind the killing.

There is now state-sponsored ""patriotic trolling"" designed to harass and intimidate, Maria Ressa, the chief executive of the news site, Rappler, told senators holding an inquiry into the spread of fake news in the Philippines. 
""Social media provided cheap armies to potential authoritarian and dictators to control and manipulate public opinion,"" Ressa said, citing a study in which Rappler participated that is set to be released in the next few months.
She did not provide details of the study, but said it mirrored the findings of a survey of 65 countries released last November by a U.S.-based group, Freedom House, that showed China and Russia were flooding social media with lies and disinformation, rather than seeking to control them.
Ressa also demonstrated for the senators how fake news was manufactured by false accounts and spread in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the top social media platform in the Philippines, with nearly 70 million users.
Governments have ""weaponised the internet"" to push propaganda, she said, but joined other journalists, bloggers and even the government's communications office, to resist senators' plans for measures to rein in social media. 
In Southeast Asia, the media fear authoritarian leaders will use new laws to target legitimate news outlets critical of them, rather than focus on false stories published on social media, as they tighten clampdowns.
""There are existing laws,"" she said. ""I don't believe that we should have more legislation but I think we should impose existing laws on this and demand accountability.""
The courts can deal with false information maligning people, said Roby Alampay, editor in chief of the BusinessWorld daily, asking lawmakers not to legislate controls on free speech, expression and the press.
""The important thing is to use our rights, to use your laws and to fight back,"" Alampay added. 
No laws will be passed to suppress freedom of the media and expression, said Grace Poe, head of the senate panel on public information, adding that senators were only interested on how to regulate the spread of false information on social media.

Rappler has invoked freedom of the press in its appeal to the Court of Appeals in the Philippines, challenging a decision of the Securities and Exchange Commission to revoke its license for violations of foreign equity curbs on domestic media.

Li Ming-che, a community college lecturer and an activist at a human rights non-governmental organization in Taiwan, had gone missing while on a trip to China in March. Chinese authorities later charged him with subverting state power. 
Li Ching-yu, his wife, refused to recognize the court's authority during the first hearing.
Li bought a plane ticket on Tuesday on Xiamen airlines, with plans to see her husband in prison, according to a statement by several human rights group who are assisting her. 
However, because she had travel documents that were deemed invalid to enter China, she was not permitted to board the plane in Taipei, the statement said. 
The statement said Li had received a notice from the Chinese government on Monday notifying her that her husband was transferred to a Hunan province prison on Dec 28. It said that family members were entitled to a family visit once a month. 
In April, Li was also denied entry into China despite having valid credentials, the associations said. She was told at the time by the airlines that her travel credentials were canceled.
""From past years until now, the Chinese government's refusal today to let family members visit relatives in prison in China demonstrates that they do not empathize to any degree, from the point of view of humanity,"" the associations said.
The Straits Exchange Foundation, a semi-official body that oversees relations between Taiwan and China, echoed the statement, calling on Chinese authorities to approve credentials for Li to travel to China, and arrange for a prison visit. 
Li could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment.

The news signaled that the three-month-old purge, in which dozens of top officials and businessmen were detained by investigators who said they aimed to seize some $100 billion of illicit assets, was drawing to a close.
""There are no longer any detainees left at the Ritz-Carlton,"" the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity under briefing rules.
He did not say how many suspects remained in detention at other locations in Saudi Arabia. Some are believed to have been moved from the Ritz to prison after refusing to admit wrongdoing and reach financial settlements with the authorities.
Last week, the attorney general said that countrywide most detainees had agreed to settlements, 90 had been released after charges were dropped, and 95 remained in custody. Some cases will go to trial.
Among top businessmen caught up in the purge were Prince Alwaleed, owner of global investor Kingdom Holding, and Waleed al-Ibrahim, who controls influential regional broadcaster MBC.
MBC said the investigation found Ibrahim completely innocent of wrongdoing and Prince Alwaleed has insisted he is innocent, although Saudi officials said both men agreed to settlements after admitting unspecified ""violations"".
In an interview with Reuters at his suite in the Ritz-Carlton hours before he was released on Saturday, Prince Alwaleed said he had been well-treated in custody and described his case as the result of a misunderstanding.
He showed off the comforts of his suite's gold-accented private office, a dining room and a kitchen which was fully stocked with his preferred vegetarian meals.

The hotel has 492 guest rooms and suites and 52 acres (21 hectares) of landscaped gardens, according to its website. It has said it will reopen to the public in mid-February, with a nightly rate for its cheapest room of 2,439 riyals ($650).

PARACHINAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - An explosion ripped through a car on Tuesday killing six members of a family driving to a Pakistan village to attend a funeral in the northwestern district of Kurram near the Afghanistan border, officials said.
It was unclear whether the blast was a landmine or a roadside bomb planted by Islamist militants, said local government official Akbar Iftikhar. Both the militants and the Pakistani military use landmines.
""Three women and three men died on the spot,"" he said. 
One survivor was in a stable condition, said Doctor Mumtaz Hussain at a hospital in Parachinar, the main town in Kurram.
Kurram is one of the seven districts along the Afghan border in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), which have long been home to local and foreign Islamist militants. 
Kurram is a predominantly minority Shiite Muslim region that is often targeted by Sunni militant groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State. The six family members, however, belonged to Sunni sect, Iftikhar said. 
The region has lately been the target of suspected U.S. drone strikes, which mainly took out members of Haqqani militant network that is allied with Afghan Taliban and operates on both sides of the border. 
The Haqqanis have been at the center of the current tensions between the United States and Pakistan. Washington alleges that Islamabad supports the Haqqani militants, who attack the U.S. and allied NATO troops in Afghanistan.

466,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Tests link Syrian government stockpile to largest sarin attack - sources,"By Anthony Deutsch
THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The Syrian government's chemical weapons stockpile has been linked for the first time by laboratory tests to the largest sarin nerve agent attack of the civil war, diplomats and scientists told Reuters, supporting Western claims that government forces under President Bashar al-Assad were behind the atrocity.
Laboratories working for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons compared samples taken by a U.N. mission in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta after the Aug. 21, 2013 attack, when hundreds of civilians died of sarin gas poisoning, to chemicals handed over by Damascus for destruction in 2014.
(For a graphic on chemical attacks click http://tmsnrt.rs/2pKDWOY )
The tests found ""markers"" in samples taken at Ghouta and at the sites of two other nerve agent attacks, in the towns of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib governorate on April 4, 2017 and Khan al-Assal, Aleppo, in March 2013, two people involved in the process said.
""We compared Khan Sheikhoun, Khan al-Assal, Ghouta,"" said one source who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the findings. ""There were signatures in all three of them that matched.""
The same test results were the basis for a report by the OPCW-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism in October which said the Syrian government was responsible for the Khan Sheikhoun attack, which killed dozens.
The findings on Ghouta, whose details were confirmed to Reuters by two separate diplomatic sources, were not released in the October report to the U.N. Security Council because they were not part of the team's mandate.
They will nonetheless bolster claims by the United States, Britain and other Western powers that Assad's government still possesses and uses banned munitions in violation of several Security Council resolutions and the Chemical Weapons Convention.
The OPCW declined to comment. Syria has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons in the conflict now in its seventh year and has blamed the chemical attacks in the rebel-held territory of Ghouta on the insurgents themselves.
Russia has also denied that Syrian government forces have carried out chemical attacks and has questioned the reliability of the OCPW inquiries. Officials in Moscow have said the rebels staged the attacks to discredit the Assad government and whip up international condemnation. 
Under a U.S.-Russian deal after the Ghouta attack in 2013, Damascus joined the OPCW and agreed to permanently eliminate its chemical weapons program, including destroying a 1,300-tonne stockpile of industrial precursors that has now been linked to the Ghouta attack.
But inspectors have found proof of an ongoing chemical weapons program in Syria, including the systematic use of chlorine barrel bombs and sarin, which they say was ordered at the highest levels of government.
The sarin attack on Khan Sheikhoun in April last year prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to order a missile strike against the Shayrat air base, from which the Syrian operation is said to have been launched.
Diplomatic and scientific sources said efforts by Syria and Russia to discredit the U.N.-OPCW tests establishing a connection to Ghouta have so far come up with nothing. 
Russia's blocking of resolutions at the Security Council seeking accountability for war crimes in Syria gained new relevance when Russia stationed its aircraft at Shayrat in 2015. 
Washington fired missiles at Shayrat in April 2017, saying the Syrian air force used it to stage the Khan Sheikhoun sarin attack on April 4 a few days earlier, killing more than 80 people. 
No Russian military assets are believed to have been hit, but Moscow warned at the time it could have serious consequences.
In June, the Pentagon said it had seen what appeared to be preparations for another chemical attack at the same airfield, prompting Russia to say it would respond proportionately if Washington took pre-emptive measures against Syrian forces there. 
""SERIOUS LAB WORK""
The chemical tests were carried out at the request of the U.N.-OPCW inquiry, which was searching for potential links between the stockpile and samples from Khan Sheikhoun. The analysis results raised the possibility that they would provide a link to other sarin attacks, the source said.
Two compounds in the Ghouta sample matched those also found in Khan Sheikhoun, one formed from sarin and the stabilizer hexamine and another specific fluorophosphate that appears during sarin production, the tests showed.
""Like in all science, it should be repeated a couple of times, but it was serious matching and serious laboratory work,"" the source said.
    Independent experts, however, said the findings are the strongest scientific evidence to date that the Syrian government was behind Ghouta, the deadliest chemical weapons attack since the Halabja massacres of 1988 during the Iran-Iraq war.
""A match of samples from the 2013 Ghouta attacks to tests of chemicals in the Syrian stockpile is the equivalent of DNA evidence: definitive proof,"" said Amy Smithson, a U.S. nonproliferation expert.
The hexamine finding ""is a particularly significant match,"" Smithson said, because it is a chemical identified as a unique hallmark of the Syrian military's process to make sarin.
""This match adds to the mountain of physical evidence that points conclusively, without a shadow of doubt, to the Syrian government,"" she said.
NO CHANCE REBELS BEHIND GHOUTA
Smithson and other sources familiar with the matter said it would have been virtually impossible for the rebels to carry out a coordinated, large-scale strike with poisonous munitions, even if they had been able to steal the chemicals from the government's stockpile.
""I don't think there is a cat in hell's chance that rebels or Islamic State were responsible for the Aug. 21 Ghouta attack,"" said Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, an independent specialist in biological and chemical weapons.
The U.N.-OPCW inquiry, which was disbanded in November after being blocked by Syria's ally Russia at the U.N. Security Council, also found that Islamic State had used the less toxic blistering agent sulfur mustard gas on a small scale in Syria.
The Ghouta attack, by comparison, was textbook chemical warfare, Smithson and de Bretton-Gordon said, perfectly executed by forces trained to handle sarin, a toxin which is more difficult to use because it must be mixed just before delivery.
Surface-to-surface rockets delivered hundreds of liters of sarin in perfect weather conditions that made them as lethal as possible: low temperatures and wind in the early hours of the morning, when the gas would remain concentrated and kill sleeping victims, many of them children.
Pre-attack air raids with conventional bombs shattered windows and doors and drove people into shelters where the heavy poison seeped down into underground hiding places. Aerial bombing afterwards sought to destroy the evidence.
The large quantity of chemicals used, along with radar images of rocket traces showing they originated from Syrian Brigade positions, are further proof that the rebels could not have carried out the Ghouta attack, the experts said.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A Cambodian judge is investigating whether to pursue pornography charges against 10 foreigners arrested after organizing a party which featured indecent dancing, a prosecutor said on Tuesday.
The 10 were arrested on Jan. 25 along with 77 other foreigners in a raid on the ""Pub Crawl or Let's Get Wet"" event in Siem Reap province, home to the ancient Angkor Wat ruins.
Siem Reap Provincial Court Prosecutor Keut Vannareth told Reuters the 10 had been charged provisionally on Monday with producing pornography for their role in organizing the party and the case had been sent to the investigating judge on Tuesday.
The other 77 foreigners arrested were freed after being educated about their unacceptable behavior.
Those charged are five Britons, one Dutch citizen, two Canadians, a New Zealander and a Norwegian, according to Sourng Sophea, an attorney for the group. In his three-page submission to the court, the lawyer said the partygoers had not been naked.
""When police arrived, they were wearing underwear and bras as they drank,"" Sourng Sophea told Reuters, adding that they could face between one month and one year in prison if convicted.
""The charge of producing pornography is a little too harsh,"" he said. ""Now, they are in prison and this is too much.""
He said the accused had not published any pictures of the event and had committed no crime.
Prosecutor Keut Vannareth declined further comment.
Cambodia has been become a favorite with backpackers and budget travelers over the past decade, but has more recently begun to establish itself as more of a luxury destination.
Angkor Wat is Cambodia's top tourist attraction. The ancient temple complex holds a special place in the country's history as the former capital of the Khmer Empire and visitors are told to behave with respect at the site.
Tourism Minister Thong Khon said he supported the arrests of the tourists.
""The law bans this kind of thing and maybe they were warned in advance,"" he said. ""Siem Reap is a heritage site.""

Japan's central government and Okinawa authorities have been at odds for years over a plan, first agreed between Tokyo and Washington in 1996, to relocate the Marines' Futenma air base from an urban part of Okinawa to the less populated Henoko district of the northern city of Nago.
Base opponents such as Nago Mayor Susumu Inamine and Okinawa Governor Takeshi Onaga oppose the move and want Futenma's functions moved off Okinawa entirely.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government wants to forge ahead with the relocation.
Many Okinawa residents associate the U.S. military presence with crime, pollution and accidents, and resentment has been rekindled by a spate of incidents involving U.S. military aircraft. Last month a window fell from a U.S. helicopter onto a school sports field, fanning safety concerns.
Inamine, who is seeking a third four-year-term with opposition party support, is leading challenger Taketoyo Toguchi, 56, who has the backing of Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner, the Komeito party, according to a Yomiuri newspaper survey published on Tuesday.
A win for Toguchi would make it easier for Abe's government to move ahead with the relocation plan.
Work is underway for construction of a Futenma replacement facility, but the Nago mayor's approval is needed for some aspects so Inamine could cause further delays if re-elected.
Sixty-nine percent of Nago voters responding to Yomiuri's survey said that Futenma's functions should be moved off Okinawa entirely; 17 percent said the original plan should go ahead.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The European Union on Tuesday criticised the Hong Kong government's decision to bar a 21-year-old activist from standing for election, saying it contradicted an international human rights treaty and risked hurting the city's reputation.
Agnes Chow, a close ally of student protest leader Joshua Wong, was officially notified over the weekend that she could not stand in a March legislature by-election because of her political party's platform.
The government's decision ""risks diminishing Hong Kong's international reputation as a free and open society,"" said Maja Kocijancic, the EU spokeswoman for foreign affairs and security policy. 
""The protection of civil and political rights in Hong Kong is an essential part of the implementation of the 'One country, two systems' principle, which the EU supports,"" Kocijancic said in a statement.
""Barring candidates from standing for election because of their political beliefs is in contradiction with the right under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights... to stand for election without unreasonable restrictions.""
The treaty has been incorporated into the laws of Hong Kong, governed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula since its return from British rule in 1997, allowing freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China that include an independent judiciary but not a fully democratic vote. 
News of the disqualification sparked a protest by 2,000 people in the Asian financial hub, and condemnation from a group of lawyers, as being ""unreasonable, unlawful and unconstitutional"".
International groups, such as Human Rights Watch and British non-government body Hong Kong Watch, also expressed concern.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday denied that she or Beijing had pressured her subordinates to bar Chow, however.
""This was done according to the law,"" she said. ""People are not, as some foreign organisations alleged, stripped of their right to stand for election because of their political affiliation.""
Wong and Chow's political party, Demosisto, formed after widespread street protests in 2014 that demanded full democracy, advocated the right to ""self-determination"".
In urging ""self-determination,"" Demosisto said it was not advocating Hong Kong's independence from China but instead demanding a referendum on its future after 2047, the year when the territory's capitalist system and ""way of life"" cease to be fully guaranteed by its mini-constitution, the Basic Law.

But Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have repeatedly condemned independence and self determination as deviations from the ""one country, two systems"" principle that cross Beijing's limits.

471,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 01:17AM ET</span>","Trump administration holds off on new Russia sanctions, despite law","By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Monday it would not immediately impose additional sanctions on Russia, despite a new law designed to punish Moscow's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, insisting the measure was already hitting Russian companies.
""Today, we have informed Congress that this legislation and its implementation are deterring Russian defense sales,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. ""Since the enactment of the ... legislation, we estimate that foreign governments have abandoned planned or announced purchases of several billion dollars in Russian defense acquisitions.""
Seeking to press President Donald Trump to clamp down on Russia, the U.S. Congress voted nearly unanimously last year to pass a law setting sweeping new sanctions on Moscow.
Trump, who wanted warmer ties with Moscow and had opposed the legislation as it worked its way through Congress, signed it reluctantly in August, just six months into his presidency.
Under the measure, the administration faced a deadline on Monday to impose sanctions on anyone determined to conduct significant business with Russian defense and intelligence sectors, already sanctioned for their alleged role in the election. 
But citing long time frames associated with major defense deals, Nauert said it was better to wait to impose those sanctions.
""From that perspective, if the law is working, sanctions on specific entities or individuals will not need to be imposed because the legislation is, in fact, serving as a deterrent,"" she said in a statement. 
The measure, known as the ""Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,"" or CAATSA, required the administration to list ""oligarchs"" close to President Vladimir Putin's government and issue a report detailing possible consequences of penalizing Russia's sovereign debt.
WOULD TRUMP CLAMP DOWN ON RUSSIA?
Monday's deadline to release those reports was seen as a test of Trump's willingness to clamp down on Russia. Critics blasted him for failing to announce any sanctions.
""The State Department claims that the mere threat of sanctions will deter Russia’s aggressive behavior. How do you deter an attack that happened two years ago, and another that’s already underway? It just doesn’t make sense,"" said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee.
""I’m fed up waiting for this Administration to protect our country and our elections,"" he said in a statement.
Members of Congress, including Democrats and some of Trump's fellow Republicans, have been clamoring for his administration to use sanctions to punish Moscow for past election interference and prevent future meddling in U.S. polls.
Shortly before midnight (0500 GMT) on Monday, the Treasury Department released an unclassified ""oligarchs"" list, including 114 senior Russian political figures and 96 business people.
Those named on the list will not immediately face any immediate penalties like asset freezes or visa bans. But the law mandated that the U.S. Treasury and State Departments, and intelligence agencies, compile a list of political figures and business people close to Putin's government and network, for potential future sanctions.
Several U.S. congressional committees, as well as Special Counsel Robert Mueller, are investigating whether Russia tried to tilt last November's election in Trump's favor, using means such as hacking into the emails of senior Democrats and promoting divisive social and political messages online. Trump and the Kremlin have separately denied any collusion. 
Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, one of the main congressional architects of the sanctions law, said he was not concerned that the administration did not announce sanctions by Monday's deadline.
""This is when sanctions season begins, and so they'll be rolling them out,"" he told reporters.

""We feel pretty good about the process,"" Corker said. ""They're rushing the information over to us today, and by the close of business, they're going to have two of the three, as I understand it. So they're taking it very seriously.""

The airlines said in separate statements they had no choice but to cancel the trips after what they said was a refusal by Taiwanese authorities to approve the flights.
This month China opened several new air routes, including a northbound route up the Taiwan Strait that divides China from the island. Taiwan says it was done without its agreement, contravening what the democratic government in Taipei has said was a 2015 deal to first discuss such flight paths.
In response, self-governed Taiwan has withheld approval of routine applications from China Eastern and Xiamen Airlines, majority owned by China Southern Airlines, to add Lunar New Year flights because the airlines had used the disputed air routes.
Taiwan has expressed concern the new routes are too close to existing routes that link it to airports on two groups of Taiwan-controlled islands lying close to China, and are a threat to flight safety. China says there is no safety threat.
China considers Taiwan a wayward province, and relations have cooled since Tsai Ing-wen of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party took office as Taiwan's president in 2016.
""We express our strong dissatisfaction and condemnation of the Taiwan authorities, who disregard public opinion and cling obstinately to their course,"" China Eastern said.
The airline apologized to customers and said it was providing free refunds and rebooking for anyone booked on the now-canceled flights.
Xiamen Airlines urged ""relevant Taiwan authorities to proceed from the standpoint of the well-being of people on both sides of the Strait, comply with popular wishes, meet the urgent needs of the people, and not artificially obstruct the return home of Taiwan compatriots.""
At a press conference on Tuesday, Taiwan's transportation minister, Ho Chen Tan, said that the government did not force the airlines to cancel their flights.
""We never said that we wouldn't approve of the added flights by China Eastern or Xiamen Airlines. All along we said we hope that the situation can meet the needs of travelers and that we can all discuss an appropriate arrangement for the added flights,"" Ho said.
""At this time, they said themselves they don’t want to apply. It's not at all that we said we didn’t agree for them to apply,"" Ho added.

With air fares rising before the Lunar New Year, Taiwan's transportation ministry said it would try its best to help Taiwanese return home over the holiday.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The wife of detained Chinese rights lawyer Yu Wensheng said on Tuesday her husband had been charged with ""inciting subversion of state power"" and that police have summonsed her after she gave interviews to foreign media. 
Yu, who has been an outspoken critic of a Chinese government crackdown on his fellow rights lawyers and activists, was taken by authorities from outside his home in Beijing on Jan. 19 shortly after he was stripped of his legal license.
Yu's wife, Xu Yan, said police informed her on Saturday that her husband was being charged with ""inciting subversion of state power"" rather than the original lighter charge of ""obstructing a public service"", she told Reuters on Tuesday.
For the last two days, police in Xuzhou city in southeastern Jiangsu province have repeatedly called to ask her to come to the police station to speak with them in connection with her husband's crimes, she said.
The police told her that the reason she is wanted is because she had given interviews with the foreign media, she said. 
A man who answered the phone at the Xuzhou city public security bureau told Reuters he was unaware of the case. 
It is unclear why Yu is being held in Xuzhou. It is not uncommon for sensitive rights cases to be transferred to different jurisdictions.
President Xi Jinping has presided over a sweeping wave of detentions and arrest of rights lawyers and activists, which has come to be known as the ""709"" incident after the date July 9, 2015, when the crackdown began in earnest.
In response, the families and friends of the rights lawyers and activists have often taken up their loved one's cause in the wake of their detention, sometimes becoming high-profile activists in their own right.
An edited video of Yu's detention showing him punching and swearing at the police officers was posed on YouTube on Jan. 22, and has since been shared repeatedly on Twitter.
Xu Yan said the video was an attempt to smear her husband.
The day before Yu was detained he had circulated a call for reform to China's state constitution, which said China should delete a preamble that grants the ruling Communist Party primacy in leadership.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon has restricted the release of critical information on the progress being made in the war in Afghanistan, a move that will limit transparency, the U.S. government's top watchdog on Afghanistan said on Monday.
For years, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, has published a quarterly report that includes unclassified data on the amount of territory controlled or influenced by the Taliban and the government.
In a report published late on Monday, SIGAR said, however, it was told not to release that information. The military also classified, for the first time since 2009, the actual and authorized total troop numbers and attrition rate for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, or ANDSF.
""The implication is that I think the average American who reads our reports or reads your press accounts of it, has no meaningful ability to analyze how his money or her money is being spent on Afghanistan,"" John Sopko, who leads the independent watchdog office, told Reuters in an interview.
The Pentagon sought to deflect blame for the decision, the latest move to limit the amount of publicly available information about the 16-year-old war in Afghanistan - America's longest. 
It said in a statement that the Department of Defense did not tell SIGAR to withhold the data, but rather it was the NATO-led Resolute Support coalition that made the determination.
It added that the Pentagon did not have the authority to overrule the classification made by Resolute Support, which is led by U.S. General John Nicholson. 
""The Department continues to work with SIGAR, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, and NATO Resolute Support to resolve concerns about restrictions on information that was previously unclassified,"" Lieutenant Colonel Michael Andrews said.
Former officials and experts said that regardless of who restricted the information, it was particularly worrying because Afghan and U.S. officials had publicly set a benchmark it would now be difficult to measure.
The top U.S. general in Afghanistan set a goal in November of driving back Taliban insurgents enough to control at least 80 percent of the country within two years.
In its most recent report, SIGAR said that 43 percent of Afghanistan's districts were either under Taliban control or being contested.
Sopko said people would to jump to the conclusion that information was being withheld because progress was not being made, which may not be the case.
A similar accusation was made during the Vietnam War, which later proved true. 
""In essence, you can ask me almost any question and I will have to say, it is classified or non-releasable, I mean you go down the list, it is just amazing,"" Sopko said.
He added that the Department of Defense did not give him any reasons for the move.
RECENT ATTACKS
The move by the Pentagon comes amid a spate of violence in Afghanistan over the past nine days that is putting a new, more aggressive strategy under the spotlight.
An ambulance bomb in the city center killed more than 100 people, just over a week after an attack on the Hotel Intercontinental, also in Kabul, killed more than 20, including four U.S. citizens.
President Donald Trump has committed an additional 3,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan in recent weeks, bringing the total number of American troops in Afghanistan to about 14,000.
Michael Kugelman, with the Woodrow Wilson Center, said it made little sense to block the information.
""It's not fair to the American people, to American troops and I would think it's pretty hard to justify doing something like this,"" Kugelman said.
It is not the first time data has been withheld on the Afghan war. 
Last year, U.S. forces in Afghanistan restricted the amount of data it provided on the ANDSF, including casualties, personnel strength and attrition rates - data that has now been completely withheld. 
The U.S. military said at the time the data belonged to the Afghan government, which did not want it released.
A former U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was pressure on the U.S. military to achieve success that could create a risk about not being fully open with the facts.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia's top court on Tuesday denied bail to an Australian filmmaker who has spent seven months behind bars accused of espionage and who faces 10 years in jail if he is convicted.
James Ricketson, 69, was arrested last June after he was photographed flying a drone above a political rally organised by the now-dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).
""A judge is still investigating this case so the continuation of detention is necessary,"" Supreme Court Judge Soeng Panhavuth told a court on Tuesday.
Ricketson was not in court to hear the decision. A clerk said a prison van transporting Ricketson to the court was late so the judge made the announcement before his arrival.
It remains unclear who Ricketson is accused of spying for.
His arrest comes amid a wider crackdown on freedom of expression by the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled for 32 years. 
Ricketson's family said they were ""very disappointed"" by the court's decision.
""They are very very disappointed by the outcome of today's proceedings and in particular that the verdict, the denial of bail, was handed down in absentia,"" his daughter-in-law Alexandra Kennett told reporters outside the court.
Kennett said Ricketson, who was close to Sam Rainsy, a former leader of the CNRP, was suffering in an overcrowded prison.
""He's suffering. He's an Australian man in a tropical climate in an incredibly cramped condition with 140 other people in his cell,"" Kennett said.
Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that it was providing consular assistance to Ricketson.
The CNRP was dissolved last year at the request of Hun Sen's government after the arrest of party leader Kem Sokha, who was accused of plotting to take power with American help - charges he says were politically motivated.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Tourism to Cuba, one of the few bright spots in its ailing economy, has slid in the wake of Hurricane Irma and the Trump administration's tighter restrictions on travel to the Caribbean island, a Cuban tourism official said on Monday.
Although the number of visitors rose nearly 20 percent in 2017, it fell 10 percent on the year in December, and is down 7-8 percent this month, Jose Manuel Bisbe York, the president of Cuban state travel agency conglomerate Viajes Cuba, said.
Arrivals from the United States, which had surged in the wake of the U.S.-Cuban detente in 2014, took the worst hit, dropping 30 percent last December, he told Reuters.
""Since Hurricane Irma, we've seen arrivals shrink,"" Bisbe York said on the sidelines of the event organized by U.S. travel agency insightCuba to dispel tourist misperceptions about Cuba.
Irma hit in September, just as the tourism sector was taking reservations for its high season from November to March.
Images of destruction put many would-be visitors off although Cuba had fixed its tourism installations within two months, said Bisbe York. Arrivals of Canadians, the largest group of tourists to Cuba, were down 4-5 percent.
""But we see this as a temporary thing and what we are seeing is that arrivals are recovering from month to month,"" said Bisbe York, adding that Cuba would go ahead with its plans to launch more than 15 hotels island-wide this year.
""The first trimester will be the most difficult, because logically the change in the public perception takes time.""
Occupancy rates at the hotels in Cuba managed by Spain's Meliá Hotels International S.A. were down around 20 percent on the year in December and January, said Francisco Camps, Melia's Cuba deputy general manager.
""From February though, we are already reaching figures similar to those we had in previous years,"" he said.
Republican President Donald Trump's more hostile stance towards Cuba than his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama looks set to have a more lasting impact than Irma.
The number of U.S. visitors had surged since the Obama administration created greater exemptions to a ban on tourism to the Caribbean's largest island and restored regular commercial flights and cruises.
Arrivals reached a record 619,523 last year, up from 91,254 in 2014.
But the Trump administration in September issued a warning on travel there due to a spate of alleged health attacks on U.S. diplomats in Havana. In November, tighter travel regulations also went into effect. 
The double whammy seriously depressed U.S. visits, American tour operators and a cruise line said at Monday's event, although in reality the restrictions remain looser than before the detente and travel easier.
Cuba is also still one of the safest destinations worldwide, they said.
""While the regulations he changed very little the perception in the U.S. was that you no longer could travel to Cuba legally,"" said insightCuba's Tom Popper, noting his agency's reservations were down 50 percent this year.

""Part of hosting this event was to communicate that it is 100 percent legal to travel to Cuba.""

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - United States and Australian aircraft joined the search for passengers of a missing ferry off Kiribati on Tuesday, as rescuers scoured the central Pacific Ocean for a liferaft believed to be carrying survivors. 
Eight people rescued from an drifting dinghy on the weekend said the ferry broke up soon after setting out on Jan. 18 and that they had seen other passengers scramble aboard a liferaft.
""There is a definitely a possibility that the people in the liferaft are alive given that only a short while ago we found people in an open dinghy alive,"" said New Zealand-based rescue coordinator Paul Craven.
""We're hoping in a liferaft they're actually in a better survival situation so that's why we've got such an intensive search going today,"" he said.
Authorities are uncertain how many people had been on board the ferry, Craven told Radio New Zealand. Reports from survivors and government officials varied between 35 and 100 people.
The 17-metre (56-foot) catamaran was reported missing on Jan. 20, two days after it departed Nonouti Island on a 250 km (155 miles) trip to Betio in Kiribati.
Australia has sent a P-3 Orion surveillance aircraft to assist in the search and the U.S. Coastguard has sent a Hercules aircraft from Hawaii to scour the northern part of the search area.
A New Zealand aircraft spotted a dinghy on Sunday with eight people, including a 14-year-old girl, who had been adrift for days without water. The eight were rescued by a fishing vessel.
They told rescuers they had scrambled into their tiny dinghy as the ferry disintegrated soon after setting off and that other passengers had made it into another dinghy and a liferaft.
The second dinghy had broken up and likely sunk, Craven said, with the search was now focusing on finding the liferaft.

He said rescuers' main concern was that any survivors would be facing the heat for days without drinking water.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's air force killed at least 35 people in attacks on villages in the northeastern state of Adamawa in December, Amnesty International said in a report on Tuesday.
Residents of the villages described being fired upon by a fighter jet and military helicopter as they attempted to flee, at the same time as hundreds of herdsmen took part in a revenge attack on the communities for earlier killings, Amnesty said.
""Launching air raids is not a legitimate law enforcement method by anyone's standard,"" said Osai Ojigho, Amnesty's country director for Nigeria, in Tuesday's report.
""Such reckless use of deadly force is unlawful, outrageous and lays bare the Nigerian military's shocking disregard for the lives of those it supposedly exists to protect,"" she said.
The report is the latest challenge to the military on human rights and the attacks suggest a deadly crisis between herders and farmers is spiraling out of government control.
Reports of abuses and military excesses rarely result in Nigeria's military meting out public discipline to officers.
Air Force spokesman Olatokunbo Adesanya denied it had bombed any locations in the region or fired shots targeting people, saying it had opened fire to dissuade looters and vandals. Adesanya said he was unaware of any human casualties.
On Dec. 4, air force fighter jets fired rockets at villages to deter communal clashes as a cycle of violence and revenge attacks gripped Adamawa state, Amnesty said.
The region is a flashpoint for violence between Muslim herders and Christian farmers over rights to grazing land and agriculture. This month at least 168 people have died across five states in such clashes, said Amnesty. 
""The helicopter and the jet started releasing bombs. Houses started burning. Children started running for their lives,"" an unnamed farmer from the village of Shafaron told Amnesty.
The report described the ""devastating cumulative effect of the herders and Air Force attacks, with at least eight villages heavily damaged or completely destroyed by fire.""
Burned husks of vehicles and blackened houses reduced in parts to rubble were shown in an accompanying video from Amnesty. Satellite images depicted large swathes of settlements ravaged by fire.
Eighty-six people died, with the Nigerian air force responsible for at least 35 deaths, and some 3,000 homes were destroyed in the five villages visited, said Amnesty.
Nigeria is in the final stages of buying fighter planes from the United States, a deal halted by former president Barack Obama's administration over concerns about the military's human rights record.
President Donald Trump's administration approved the sale. That came after as many as 170 people died last January after Nigeria's air force bombed a refugee camp.
Nigeria's military receives regular training from the United States and Britain.

482,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Canada debates new harassment legislation amid #MeToo storm,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's parliament began debate on Monday on new legislation to tighten workplace harassment rules, including those governing politicians, as allegations of sexual misconduct mounted against lawmakers on both sides of the political spectrum.
The bill, introduced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government in November, gained a new prominence after a federal cabinet minister and two provincial party leaders stepped down last week after being accused of inappropriate behavior. 
While the proposed law will govern all federal workplaces, including private businesses, the environment among political staffers in Ottawa was in focus as the #MeToo social media movement gained momentum in Canada.
""It clearly is a crisis in this workplace,"" Employment Minister Patty Hajdu told reporters outside the House of Commons. ""We talk a lot about getting women into politics, and if we can't actually protect the women staffers in our own workplaces, we have a long ways to go.""
Last week, Trudeau announced that federal Cabinet Minister Kent Hehr, 48, had resigned pending an investigation into allegations that he made inappropriate comments to women.
That announcement followed the resignation of Patrick Brown and Jamie Baillie, the leaders of the Progressive Conservatives in the provinces of Ontario and Nova Scotia, respectively.
The president of Ontario's Progressive Conservative party, Rick Dykstra, also quit Sunday after Maclean's magazine published a story containing allegations that Dykstra had sexually assaulted a young political staff member during his time as a federal member of parliament. 
“ (O)ver the next couple of months we will see the party coalesce around a new Leader. As this process unfolds, I have made the decision to step aside as President and take a step back for someone else to lead us through the hard work,"" Dykstra said on Twitter.
He did not respond to a Reuters request for comment Monday.
The government's legislation would outline procedures from employers to deal with allegations of harassment and bullying, add the option of an outside investigator, and enforce privacy rules to protect victims.
Previously, if an employee had a complaint about a member of Parliament, they had to work through the party or the speaker of the House of Commons to resolve the issue.

In the United States, sexual harassment allegations have also engulfed men in politics, business and the workplace, inspired by the #MeToo social media movement supported by victims of sexual harassment or abuse.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has ordered a review of security protocols, officials say, after fitness tracking devices broadcast patterns of movement at military facilities around the world, including in war zones.
Nathan Russer, a student at the Australian National University in Canberra, drew attention to data when he wrote on Twitter about the images after stumbling upon GPS tracking company Strava's Global Heatmap. It can be viewed at ""Once you look at Syria you can see a bunch of bright spots,"" Russer said. His discovery prompted others to scour the heat map, turning up other possible locations of U.S. and other mostly Western personnel who typically use high-tech fitness devices, including elsewhere in the Middle East and in Africa. Although many of the bases cited by Russer and others are well-known outposts that host U.S. and U.S.-backed personnel, there are clear risks that such tracking devices pose, potentially disclosing not just the broad locations where foreign troops operate but the routes they travel. There is also the risk that Strava itself could become a target of nations trying to mine its data to discover identifiable information about who was wearing the devices. Jim Lewis, a cyber expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said fitness trackers were just one way that all mobile wireless technology can undermine operational security and give adversaries an edge. ""The Russians are pretty good at this and there are ways to combine the data from trackers with social media profiles,"" Lewis said. ""Social networks are the bane of operational security.""  The Department of Defense said it encourages all defense personnel, wherever they are, to limit their public presence on the internet. That guidance is even more strict when troops operate in sensitive locations. But officials said Mattis was aware of the issue and had ordered a review. ""DOD takes matters like these very seriously and is reviewing the situation to determine if any additional training or guidance is required,"" the Pentagon said in a statement, without directly confirming that U.S. troops had used the fitness trackers. The Pentagon also said it was considering whether additional steps needed to be taken ""to ensure the continued safety of DOD personnel at home and abroad."" 
Pentagon spokesman Colonel Robert Manning told reporters at a news briefing he did not know of any instances in which U.S. base security had been compromised as a result of the mapping.

The killings came two days after gunmen killed at least 14 people in a crowded dance club in the northeastern Brazil city of Fortaleza. Authorities were investigating whether the attack was part of drug gang conflict.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday rejected the idea of talks with the Taliban after a series of deadly attacks in Afghanistan, in an apparent contradiction of his own strategy to end America's longest foreign war. 
Trump condemned the militant group for the carnage in Kabul and pledged to ""finish what we have to finish.""
Trump's comments suggest he sees a military victory over the Taliban, an outcome that military and diplomatic officials say cannot be achieved with the resources and manpower he has authorized.
When he announced an increase in U.S. troops to Afghanistan in August, U.S. officials said the goal was to force the Taliban to negotiate a political settlement. 
""I don't see any talking taking place,"" Trump told reporters as he began meeting at the White House with members of the United Nations Security Council.
""I don't think we're prepared to talk right now. It's a whole different fight over there. They're killing people left and right. Innocent people are being killed left and right.""
Trump last year ordered an increase in U.S. troops to Afghanistan, air strikes and other assistance to Afghan forces. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said earlier this month the strategy was working and pushing the insurgents closer to peace talks.
That was before a suicide bomber penetrated the highly guarded center of Kabul on Saturday and detonated an explosives-laden ambulance, killing more than 100 people and wounding at least 235. That attack followed a brazen Taliban assault on the city's Intercontinental Hotel and other acts of violence.
Four U.S. citizens were killed and two wounded in the Jan. 20 attack on the Intercontinental Hotel, the U.S. State Department said last week. At least 20 people were killed in the hotel assault.
NO EVIDENCE OF MILITARY VICTORY
""When you see what they're doing and the atrocities that they're committing, and killing their own people, and those people are women and children ... it is horrible,"" Trump said.
""We don't want to talk to the Taliban. We're going to finish what we have to finish, what nobody else has been able to finish, we're going to be able to do it,"" Trump said.
Current and former U.S. officials said that despite the carnage, the United States had no choice but to promote peace talks. 
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed surprise at Trump’s comments and said there was an understanding that defeating the Taliban was not purely a military problem.
“You can never really take talks off the table,” the official said.
Laurel Miller, who served as acting U.S. special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan until June, said the stated goal of Trump's Afghanistan strategy was ""to increase military pressure on the Taliban in order to motivate them to engage in a political settlement.""
There is no evidence, she said, ""that suggests that the U.S. and Afghan forces can defeat the Taliban on the battlefield."" 
Afghanistan's U.N. ambassador, Mahmoud Saikal, told Reuters on Monday that fighting needed to continue against certain elements of the Taliban.
""There are two categories of Taliban: One is the reconcilable elements who are in touch with us, who are talking to us, and one is the irreconcilable,"" Saikal said.

“The irreconcilables and those who have chosen to fight, we need to fight. We need to fight against them, we need to have the capability to withstand against them and to defend our people,"" he said.

Army secretary Mark Esper told reporters during a visit to U.S. troops in Wiesbaden, Germany, that NATO members had recommitted to meeting the NATO 2-percent target in 2017, and he would take the German government at its word that it would stick to that pledge.
""It's important for all of our NATO allies to live up to their commitments,"" Esper said during a teleconference on Monday. ""If not, it weakens the alliance, clearly, and Germany is such a critical member of NATO.""
Esper said Germany had a particularly important role in NATO given its economic strength in Europe and its leadership within NATO. ""I take the German government at their word that they're going to get to the 2 percent and live up to that,"" he said.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats are locked in negotiations about renewing the coalition government that ruled since 2013. 
A negotiating blueprint hammered out by the two political blocs did not mention the NATO target specifically - dodging an issue that continues to divide the parties.
The BDI industry association this month estimated that Germany spent just 1.13 percent of its economic output on the military in 2017, well below NATO's projection of 1.22 percent due to stronger-than-expected economic growth.
BDI expert Matthias Wachter said the percentage could drop further in coming years if the economy's expansion outpaced planned increases in military spending.
Esper said NATO's efforts to reassure Poland and the Baltic States remained a key priority to guard against any Russian ""adventurism"" given Russia's actions in Georgia and Ukraine.
""We all wish that Russia was on a different trajectory, but after what we've seen in Georgia and Ukraine, we have to hope for the best and prepare for the worst,"" he said, referring to the Russian military incursion into Georgia in 2008 and the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro, who pitched himself as the ""son"" of Hugo Chavez to appeal to voters ahead of his 2013 presidential win, has all but scrubbed mention of the late socialist leader from his campaign for re-election this year. 
Chavez is barely anywhere in Maduro's new campaign song or logo, unveiled in recent days ahead of presidential elections slated to be held before the end of April in the crisis-torn country. 
Maduro's campaign logo features a big 'M' emblazoned in the yellow, blue, and red Venezuelan flag colors.
""Together we can do more. Nicolas Maduro, president,"" reads the slogan promoting the former bus driver and union leader. 
During the 2013 race to replace Chavez, who died of cancer, Socialist Party billboards usually featured the charismatic late president's face and the slogan, ""From my heart, (I want) Maduro president."" 
And while the new campaign song, a catchy mix of reggaeton, merengue and rap, makes a brief reference to Chavez by mentioning his nickname ""comandante,"" the song is squarely focused on Maduro. 
""Nicolas Maduro, a driver of victories, is guiding Venezuela to peace and glory!"" goes the song, publicized on Maduro's Twitter feed, with the chorus urging, ""Everyone with Maduro!"" 
That's a far cry from the 2013 campaign song, which kicked off with a recording of Chavez naming Maduro his political heir and featured the chorus: ""Chavez, I swear to you, I'll vote for Maduro!""
""BURYING THE FATHER"" 
The shift highlights how Maduro, although widely disliked due to a brutal economic crisis that has sparked malnutrition and disease, is seeking to carve out his own political image away from his far more popular predecessor. 
""Symbolically, Maduro is burying his political father,"" said Andres Canizalez, a professor and expert in political communications. 
""If this turns out to be successful, we could be in the presence of a metamorphosis in the political process to go from 'Chavismo' to 'Madurismo',"" added Canizalez. 
But the shift could also heighten growing tensions in the ruling Socialist Party, once firmly held together by the dominant Chavez. Rafael Ramirez, a former oil czar in exile and wanted for alleged corruption, has lashed out at Maduro for his handling of the economy and asked for guarantees to return to the country and face him in primaries.
But officials have said there is but ""one candidate"" in this year's vote, solidifying Maduro's grip on the country after major anti-government protests last year. 
During a softball game on Sunday, Maduro and his cabinet played against military officers, who had the words ""Chavez lives"" emblazoned on their blue shirts. 

Maduro, meanwhile, wore a white uniform with the Venezuelan colors on its sleeves.

ROME (Reuters) - University professors, a businessman who lost his savings in a 2015 state bank bailout and a former Olympic athlete will run as candidates for the 5-Star Movement in Italy's election, the anti-establishment group announced on Monday.
5-Star, which has ridden a wave of dissatisfaction with conventional politics to become Italy's most popular party, is fighting accusations of incompetence and inexperience from its mainstream rivals ahead of the March 4 ballot.
""These aren't competent people, they are super-competent,"" 5-Star's leader Luigi Di Maio told a news conference. 
""We firmly believe you need to put both head and heart into public policy. You need abilities but you also need sensitivity, humanity.""
Opinion polls suggest 5-Star will get more votes than any other party but come in behind a center-right alliance headed by former premier Silvio Berlusconi. Neither group looks set to win enough votes for a working majority, raising the chances there will be more talks to form alliances.
Candidates presented on Monday included Lorenzo Fioramonti, a 40-year-old economics professor at the University of Pretoria, who has met foreign officials on 5-Star's behalf in the past and is due to travel with Di Maio to London's financial center in the coming days.
Fioramonti enthusiastically backed 5-Star's criticism of European Union rules, especially the Fiscal Compact which imposes budget cuts on high-debt countries like Italy.
""I imagine changing the treaties, parameters and other things that are strangling our economy today,"" said Fioramonti, who will run in a dilapidated suburb of Rome.
5-Star has backed away from a pledge to hold a referendum on the euro, which had rattled financial markets. 
In the Rome constituency where Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni will run for the Democratic Party (PD), 5-Star's candidate will be Angelo Cirulli, a businessman who was among thousands of retail investors to lose their savings during a state rescue of four regional banks.
""Only 5-Star listened to us and shared our criticism,"" Cirulli told the news conference. 

Olympic bronze medalist and judo coach Felice Mariani will also run for the movement, as will the head of Rome's order of lawyers.

A car bomb exploded on Saturday outside a police station in the town of San Lorenzo, on the border with Colombia, wrecking the station, damaging other houses in the area, and leaving 28 people with minor injuries.
""They are dissident groups of the FARC, dissident groups of a subversive movement that our brothers in Colombia has and that we are fighting because they have dedicated themselves to drug trafficking,"" Defense Minister Patricio Zambrano told reporters in Quito.
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) fought the Colombian government for more than 52 years, but demobilized after a 2016 peace deal. 
Though thousands of members handed over their arms, more than 1,000 are estimated to have refused, choosing to continue lucrative drug trafficking and illegal mining. 
Police seized more than seven tons of chemicals and another ton of drugs in recent days and arrested seven people linked to dissident FARC operating on the border, according to official data. 
Zambrano said the groups are seeking to ""frighten the population"" as the government combats drug trafficking.

Former Mexico City mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who leads polls ahead of the July 1 election, spoke at an event in the capital to present his planned nominees for top prosecutorial posts.
""We will propose a legal reform to suppress immunity and privileges,"" Lopez Obrador said, including changing the constitution to allow the president to be judged for ""the crimes of corruption and violation of political electoral rights.""
""Corruption will end, impunity will end,"" he said.
Mexican law does not provide for impeachment of the president and mandates that the incumbent can only be put on trial for treason and serious crimes, such as murder.
Late last year, a group of opposition senators put forth a similar proposal.
Lopez Obrador is running a campaign based on fighting entrenched corruption and he has consolidated support, a poll showed Monday. However, the race has tightened as another opposition contender gained ground while the ruling party hopeful trailed.
The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has been hit by graft scandals and allegations of conflict of interest surrounding President Enrique Pena Nieto and several top aides.
Lopez Obrador said he would propose three candidates for congressional approval to take over the position as attorney general: judges Eva De Gyves Zarate and Juan Luis Gonzalez Alcantara and lawyer Bernardo Batiz, who served as the capital's attorney general when Lopez Obrador was mayor.

He said he would not lobby in favor of any of the three and would leave the decision to lawmakers, if he wins the election. He also put forward candidates to take over as top electoral crimes prosecutor and a newly created anti-corruption post.

Rear Admiral Ali Ozmaei's remarks cited by Tasnim news agency followed last week's comments by U.S. military officials that the Iranian military had halted routine ""harassment"" of U.S. naval vessels in the Gulf. 
Each state accuses the other of having flouted international regulations in the sea area, which is a major trade route for oil.
In recent years, there have been periodic confrontations between the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and U.S. military in the Gulf.
""We see that Americans behavior has changed. They pay more attention to international regulations and avoid approaching Iran's territorial waters,"" Ozmaei, the Guards' fifth naval district commander, said.
In the first such confrontation since President Donald Trump took office, a U.S. Navy ship fired warning shots when an Iranian vessel approached to within 450 feet (140 meters) last July.
The following month an unarmed Iranian drone came within 100 feet (30 meters) of a U.S. Navy warplane as it prepared to land on an aircraft carrier in the Gulf.

During the presidential campaign last September, Trump said any Iranian vessel that harassed the U.S. Navy in the Gulf would be “shot out of the water”.

The dispute between President Michel Aoun, a Christian, and the Shi'ite Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri reflects personal hostility dating to the 1975-90 civil war. It also touches on the balance of power between their sects in a system that shares out government participation according to religious sect.
The tension reached boiling point on Monday as footage of Aoun's son-in-law, Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, calling Berri ""a thug"" was circulated on social media. 
Berri's camp reacted with fury, saying Bassil had crossed ""red lines"". Supporters of Berri from the Amal movement he has led for decades protested by setting tyres ablaze in Beirut.
Gunfire was heard as Berri supporters gathered in a protest near offices of Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) in Jdeideh, a Christian area east of Beirut, drawing soldiers to the area to guard against further trouble, security sources said. 
The crisis has spiraled since December when Aoun signed a decree promoting dozens of army officers without the signature of Shi'ite Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil, a member of Amal and one of his closest aides.
Berri has said that Aoun, by moving to promote pro-Aoun officers, has exceeded his powers at the expense of other sects.
It has shattered the rare moment of national unity that saved Lebanon from strife during the crisis over Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri's shock resignation in November.
The tensions have also shaken Aoun's ties with the Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah, whose links to Berri and Amal run much deeper than its political alliance with the FPM, which was founded by Aoun and is now led by Bassil.
Bassil expressed regret for his remarks in an interview with the pro-Hezbollah al-Akhbar newspaper. But this did little to ease the standoff.
A political source close to Berri said the dispute was ""open to all possibilities, up to the point of paralyzing the country"", but did not see a risk to civil peace. ""We will not see a return of anarchy,"" the source said. 
Berri and Aoun, both in their 80s, were civil war-time enemies. The conflict ended in 1990 when the Syrian army forced Aoun, then head of one of two rival governments, from the presidential palace and into exile.
Berri emerged from the war as one of the most powerful figures in Lebanon. Aoun only returned to Lebanon in 2005 when the era of Syrian military presence was brought to an end by the assassination of Rafik al-Hariri, which triggered pressure on Damascus to withdraw troops from Lebanon.
IN BREACH OF THE CONSTITUTION?
Helped by his alliance with Hezbollah, Aoun finally realized his long-held ambition of becoming president in 2016 in a deal that made Hariri prime minister. Berri and Amal MPs were among the few not to support Aoun's candidacy.
Aoun and Berri cooperated closely to help resolve the crisis caused by Hariri's unexpected resignation in November. Lebanese officials say Saudi Arabia forced him to step down and held him against his will before French intervention led to his return. 
Hariri, Lebanon's top Sunni, said he was working on an initiative to end the Aoun-Berri standoff. ""The country is not in need of escalation or crisis,"" he said after talks with Aoun, later in a statement describing the row as saddening.
Hezbollah rejected what it described as an insult to Berri. ""This language takes the country toward dangers it could do without,"" Hezbollah said in a statement.
Hariri hopes to secure international support for Lebanon's security forces at a Rome conference in February, and billions of dollars of investment in its struggling economy at a Paris conference in late March or early April. 
But the Aoun-Berri standoff could rumble on until the parliamentary elections, and even beyond them, analysts say.
Berri says Aoun contravened the peace deal that ended the civil war by approving army promotions without the finance minister's signature. Aoun - an opponent of the peace deal when it was agreed in 1989 - says he did not. The agreement diluted the powers of the Maronite Christian presidency.
The parliamentary election, Lebanon's first since 2009, is expected to go ahead regardless. Bassil, 47 and head of the FPM, aims to secure a seat in parliament.
""No doubt matters are heading toward more escalation for two reasons: firstly we are approaching parliamentary elections and there is a fight for popularity,"" said Rajeh Khoury, a columnist with an-Nahar and Alsharq Al-Awsat newspapers.

""Secondly, there is a dispute over authority and responsibilities in government ... How the constitution is interpreted has unfortunately become a matter of opinion.""

493,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",Romania's legislators approve new government; EU ministry in spotlight,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's parliament overwhelmingly endorsed a new Social Democrat-led government on Monday, giving Prime Minister Viorica Dancila a mandate that will be scrutinized closely by the country's foreign partners and investors.
Dancila was named prime minister earlier this month to replace Mihai Tudose, who quit after a falling out with the powerful leader of the Social Democrats, Liviu Dragnea. Tudose himself became prime minister when Dragnea forced out his predecessor, Sorin Grindeanu, last summer.
Dancila had to be approved in a vote of confidence, which she won easily on Monday - 282 legislators backed her, including some junior opposition groups . The new cabinet retains around a third of the former government's ministers. 
""This government, as a whole, does not bode well for the rule of law in Romania and its relations with the West, particularly with the European Union,"" said independent political commentator Cristian Patrasconiu.
Dancila has set up a new ministry to handle European Union funds and nominated as its head Social Democrat lawmaker Rovana Plumb, whom anti-corruption prosecutors wanted to investigate. Her appointment has fueled renewed concerns about Romania's commitment to seriously tackling graft.
Parliament rejected the prosecutors' attempt to investigate Plumb, who denied any wrongdoing. But then-Prime Minister Tudose sacked her and two other ministers, saying graft allegations were damaging Romania's relations with the EU.
On Monday, Prime Minister Dancila said her cabinet reflected the 2016 general elections. ""Together with my colleagues, I do represent the political will of the ruling coalition,"" she said.
""Today, you do not vote for persons but back Romanian citizens' desire revealed by democracy. We will govern with pride and respect for Romanians, having the government program in front of us,"" Dancila told parliament.
The revised governing program includes plans to further increase pensions and the minimum wage, cut value-added tax by one percentage point to 18 percent from 2019. It also aims to set up a sovereign wealth fund and boost the absorption of EU funds. 

But leftist legislators aim to change the criminal code that would decriminalize several graft offences, their second attempt in a year to fight off a crackdown on corruption. Last week, Brussels urged parliament to reconsider earlier judicial reforms, which critics say weaken judicial independence.

HIMARE, Albania (Reuters) - The six Greek soldiers buried under the Brigo family's olive trees near Himare, a town in southern Albania, have a shrine marking their resting place.
Scattered in the nearby valleys, however, others don't. Their remains lie where they fell in 1941, fighting in hot pursuit of the Italian fascist troops they chased out of Greece.
The Italians swept from Albania and were held back for a while until German troops had to step in. The Greek prime minister famously said one word - ochi, or no - when asked to surrender, still marked in Greece as Ochi Day.
Greek families come to Albania to pay their respects on Ochi Day every year, but have no real graves to stand by.
Having tried in fits and starts to exhume and rebury the Greek fallen since Albania ditched communism in 1992, Athens and Tirana have finally started to exhume 7,976 fallen soldiers to re-inter them in cemeteries across Albania.
The first remains have already been exhumed in Sajmola Valley in central southern Albania. Greece's foreign ministry described them as ""the last unburied fallen of World War Two"".
At the foot of Mount Skutara, in an olive grove overlooking Greece's Corfu island, six dead soldiers were less forgotten. They were killed by Italian artillery shortly after celebrating Orthodox Easter at Jani Brigo's home.
""My father's dying wish was that I preserve Andreas Provatas's wallet and watch over the graves,"" Ermioni Brigo, 85, told Reuters as she swept away olives from the memorial. ""I did, although helping them (impacted) us like gangrene."" 
Her father was jailed for 11 months by the Italians, accused of being a ""philhellene"", and was then arrested by the communists, only to be saved by an Albanian deserter from the Italian army he had sheltered and who has since become a partisan commander.
In Sajmola Valley, Italians were once buried, but the plot is now empty because Italy repatriated them.
The Greeks want their dead to be buried here, something that has caused some political grumbling by Albanians who worry about Greek nationalists' claims on southern Albania, home also to the ethnic Greek community.
Hence some of the delay.
A short ride east, at the Church of Saint Nicholas near Kelcyre, the bones of 257 unidentified Greeks have been stored in white bags inside aluminum and wooden caskets for four years. 
Outside, the graves for them are empty.
""They are dead and do no harm, the evil is amongst us, the living,"" the church's warden Kristo Koci, 75, told Reuters.

Zeman won a second term in a presidential election in the Czech Republic last weekend after campaigning on a tough stance against immigration and touting his courtship of Russia and China.
In a message of congratulations, European Council President Donald Tusk wrote: ""I trust that your country will continue to play an active and constructive role within the European Union.""
The former Polish prime minister, who has tried to calm mounting frictions between the wealthier governments in the west and the formerly-communist EU states in the east, highlighted his own efforts to get the bloc to ""better respond to European citizens’ concerns"" -- a nod to popular worries over issues such as immigration.
The head of the EU's executive European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, echoed Tusk's appeal for cooperation.
""In an increasingly polarized and complex world, we need to build bridges within and between countries,"" he wrote.
Later on Monday, Juncker was due to host Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who has support from Zeman as he struggles to form a government following a parliamentary election in October.
While Babis is expected to reassure Juncker that Prague remains dedicated to the EU, he will also make clear he would not help other countries in the bloc by agreeing to host any refugees, sources said. 

The migration dispute, which has split the eastern members of the bloc from their western and southern peers, has caused bad blood in the EU, weakening member states' trust in each other.

The United Nations has said it wants to help Libya organize national elections by the end of this year as it seeks to break a deadlock between factions based in the east and west of the country.
U.N. officials including special representative Ghassan Salame have acknowledged complex political, security and legislative challenges to holding such a vote, but say they are encouraged by support for elections among Libyans. 
Salame traveled to an African Union summit in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa to discuss with regional leaders how to pursue a common approach on Libya.
""We received (Salame), who agreed that this conflict is so complicated and difficult that none of the organizations can solve it by its own,"" Smail Chergui, commissioner of the African Union's (AU) Peace and Security Council, told journalists on the sidelines of the summit. 
""So it is a renewed engagement that the two organizations (U.N. and AU) will work hand in hand to promote reconciliation and prepare the necessary conditions for elections,"" Chergui said.
""We (AU member countries) are saying that we should not rush for elections. We have to prepare solid ground for peaceful and credible elections so that the results will be respected by all the parties."" 
The U.N. is trying to revive a stalled peace plan for Libya that was signed in December 2015.
The last time the country held elections, in 2014, the results were disputed and a conflict that developed after a 2011 uprising deepened, resulting in rival governments being established in Tripoli and the east.

497,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 11:45AM ET</span>",Kremlin unfazed by Syrian opposition boycott of peace conference,"By Andrew Osborn and Tom Perry
MOSCOW/BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Kremlin shrugged off a Syrian opposition decision to boycott a peace conference in Russia this week, saying on Monday the event would go ahead regardless and make a meaningful contribution to a political solution.
Russia is hosting what it has called a Syrian Congress of National Dialogue in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Tuesday that it hopes will launch negotiations on drafting a new constitution for Syria after almost seven years of civil war.
But Western powers and some Arab states believe Sochi is an attempt to create a separate peace process that would undermine U.N. efforts to broker a peace deal while laying the groundwork for a solution more suitable to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his allies, Russia and Iran.
A spokesman for the Syrian opposition said on Saturday it would not attend the Russian event, dismissing the gathering as an attempt by Moscow to sideline the U.N.-backed peace process.
The decision was a setback for Moscow, which is keen to cast itself and President Vladimir Putin as an important Middle East peace broker after its military helped turn the tide of the conflict in Syria in Assad's favor.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call with reporters: ""The fact that some representatives of the processes currently taking place in Syria are not participating is unlikely to stop this congress from going ahead and is unlikely to seriously undermine the importance of the congress."" 
IMMEDIATE BREAKTHROUGHS IMPROBABLE
""Everyone recognizes that immediate breakthroughs in the Syrian peace process are unlikely to be possible. The only thing that is possible is patient, incremental, detailed work that can move us forward. In this sense, the Congress will be a very important, meaningful step on this road.""
Separately, Putin's Syria envoy Alexander Lavrentiev told the TASS news agency that Moscow regretted the opposition leadership's decision to stay away, but said he hoped ""common sense"" would prevail and they would change their minds.
He said some members of other opposition factions would attend and that ""all strata"" of Syrian society would be represented.
Lavrentiev told TASS he expected the conference to focus on selecting the members of a commission to draft a new Syrian constitution and for delegates to appeal for help to rebuild Syria.
Fresh elections and the country's name are also expected to be discussed. 
The opposition says the event is a waste of time, however. 
George Sabra, a prominent figure in the Syrian political opposition, told Reuters by phone:
""(Sochi) is a project to serve Russian policy. The Russians are trying, through this congress, to find a place for themselves in the Syrian political space after putting their heavy hand on Syrian land.""
Top Syrian Kurdish politician Hediye Yusuf, an architect of Kurdish-led autonomy plans for northern Syria, also predicted on social media that the event would yield little of import.
""Sochi will not bring results if the parties that are present on the ground are not there,"" wrote Yusuf.
Russia, together with Turkey and Iran, was already presiding over a separate track of peace talks in Kazakhstan distinct from U.N.-backed Geneva talks, and the Sochi event was meant to kick start a peace process mired in disagreement.
Moscow says its own peacemaking efforts are meant to complement, not compete with U.N. attempts.

Russia says some 1,600 Syrian delegates have been invited to take part in the congress when it opens on Tuesday.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Executive branch government employees in Argentina will get no pay raises this year and one out of every four ""political positions"" appointed by ministers will be cut, President Mauricio Macri said on Monday, deepening his austerity drive. 
The clampdown on political positions, including advisers appointed by government ministers, is viewed as an attack on a patronage system that has been in place for decades. 
The firings, expected to save $77 million a year, are symbolic of Macri's drive to regain market confidence.
""Austerity has to be part of politics,"" Macri said in a televised address.
He spent the first two years of his administration dismantling the trade and currency controls set up by his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez, who had expanded the role of government in the economy.
He was elected in 2015 with a mandate to free the markets and improve Argentina's business climate.
Macri, expected to seek re-election next year, denounced ""the corruption and clientelism"" of past administrations. Included in the measures announced on Monday, family members of ministers were banned from holding government jobs.
Macri scored a series of business-friendly legislative wins late last year after his coalition swept mid-term elections. But passage of his pension reform bill last month triggered violent protests and a decline in the president's approval ratings.
""The government wants to foster the idea that politically appointed officials share the burden of the fiscal adjustment. It also wants to convey the message that this administration really is different from its predecessors,"" said Ignacio Labaqui, analyst for consultancy Medley Global Advisors. 
Pressured by the country's powerful labor unions, the government canceled a special session of Congress planned for February to debate Macri's proposed labor reform.

The bill includes amnesty for companies that register workers who had been paid off the books. It aims to curb litigation by workers and would lighten social security taxes paid by employers. The private sector has long argued for more flexibility in labor regulations.

499,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",Death toll rises on second day of clashes in Yemeni port of Aden,"By Mohammed Mukhashaf
ADEN, Yemen (Reuters) - Four people were killed on Monday in a second day of fighting between rival factions seeking control of the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, where the internationally recognized administration is based, witnesses and officials said.
The clashes between southern separatists allied to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and forces loyal to Saudi-based President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi risk crippling their once united campaign against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement.
Witnesses reported fighting outside Yemeni government camps in the districts of Khor Maksar and Dar Saad in the north of Aden. The clashes involved tanks and heavy artillery targeting a hill, Jabal Hadeed, which overlooks Khor Maksar and Aden port.
The SABA state news agency, controlled by the Hadi government, said four people had died in Monday's fighting, bringing the total death toll since Sunday to 16 and the number of wounded to 141.
President Hadi issued a statement ordering the military to secure the city and assuring the population that his government was capable of handling the situation.
The witnesses said forces loyal to the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which was formed last year to push for the revival of the former independent state of South Yemen, were apparently trying to wrest control of two bases in Aden from Prime Minister Ahmed bin Daghr's government. 
In downtown Aden, most people stayed off the streets as government forces guarded the main road to al-Maasheeq palace where the government is based. 
Aden airport was closed for a second consecutive day because of the fighting, local officials said. 
WARNING
A government source said the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen in support of the Hadi administration should rein in the STC separatists or else the battle against the Houthis would suffer.
""The military commanders leading the battle in the western part of Yemen (against the Houthis) have given short notice to the Saudis and the UAE to intervene to end the fighting in Aden. Otherwise they will leave the battlefront and move back to Aden to assist President Hadi and the government,"" the source said.
Sunday's fighting broke out after the expiry of a deadline set last week by separatists from the STC for Hadi to dismiss the bin Daghr government, accusing it of corruption and mismanagement. The government denies the charges.
Bin Daghr has described the ultimatum as a coup against the internationally-recognized government, which the STC has accused of attacking civilians who had converged on the city's Parades Square (NYSE:SQ) from across southern Yemen for a rally.
The clashes in Aden have effectively divided the city into two zones, one controlled by the STC and one by the government.
Although Hadi remains in exile in Saudi Arabia, his administration and local allies nominally control about four-fifths of Yemen's territory. 

The factional fighting in the south compounds the misery of Yemenis whose country has been torn apart by three years of conflict between Hadi's forces and the Houthis.

The Jan. 19-25 voter survey by Buendia & Laredo showed Lopez Obrador winning 32 percent of support, while Ricardo Anaya, the former chairman of the conservative National Action Party (PAN) leading a right-left coalition, had 26 percent.
Back in third place, with 16 percent support ahead of the July 1 election, was Jose Antonio Meade, an ex-finance minister seeking the nomination of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the poll published in newspaper El Universal showed.
The PRI will not formally choose its candidate until Feb. 18. However, the party's leaders are behind Meade, and he is widely expected to be confirmed as their candidate despite some internal grumbling about how the campaign is proceeding.
A separate survey earlier this month also showed Meade failing to gain traction. If that trend persists, it would turn the election into a head-to-head contest between former Mexico City mayor Lopez Obrador, 64, and Anaya, 38.
A Dec. 6 Buendia & Laredo poll gave Lopez Obrador 31 percent backing of voters, Anaya 23 percent and Meade 16 percent.
However, the December survey had only 13 percent undecided voters, while there were 20 percent in this month's poll. That means the gaps separating the three main contenders would be wider in January if those voters were discounted.
Lopez Obrador, the runner-up in the past two presidential contests, has been a polarizing figure in Mexican politics, especially since he brought much of the capital to a standstill with massive protests when he narrowly lost the 2006 election.
But the new survey showed his image had improved. 
Some 49 percent of respondents held a positive view of him in January, compared with 44 percent in December. At the same time, the percentage of respondents with a negative opinion of him fell to 25 percent from 32 percent.
That net positive balance of 24 points was well ahead of Anaya, whose positives outweighed his negatives by 11 points.

The latest poll was based on 1,002 interviews and had a margin of error of 3.53 percentage points.

501,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 10:49AM ET</span>",Eleven Afghan soldiers killed in latest attack in Kabul,"By Mirwais Harooni and Hamid Shalizi
KABUL (Reuters) - Militants on Monday raided a military academy in Kabul, the Afghan capital, killing 11 soldiers, the fourth major attack in a spate of violence over the past nine days that is putting a new, more aggressive U.S. strategy under the spotlight.
Five gunmen attacked an army outpost near one of Afghanistan's main military academies on Monday and 11 soldiers were killed and 15 wounded before the attackers were subdued, the defense ministry said.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack near the Marshal Fahim military academy on the city's western outskirts, in which four of the gunmen were killed and one captured.
It came two days after an ambulance bomb in the city center killed more than 100 people and just over a week after another attack on the Hotel Intercontinental, also in Kabul, killed more than 20.
Both of those attacks were claimed by the Taliban.
Ministry of Defence officials said the five militants, armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic rifles, attacked the outpost near the well-defended academy just before dawn.
""The Afghan National Army is the country's defense force and makes sacrifices for the security and well-being of the people,"" the ministry said.
Security officials at the scene said the gunmen had used a ladder to get over a wall into the post.
In October, a suicide attacker rammed a car full of explosives into a bus carrying cadets from the academy, known as the Defence University, killing 15 of them.
While militants claiming allegiance to Islamic State operate in mountains in the eastern province of Nangarhar, little is known about the group and many analysts question whether they are solely responsible for the attacks they have claimed in Kabul and elsewhere.
Islamic State claimed an assault on the office of aid group Save the Children in the eastern city of Jalalabad on Wednesday in which six people were killed.
The attacks have put pressure on President Ashraf Ghani and his U.S. allies, who have expressed growing confidence that a new, more aggressive military strategy has succeeded in driving Taliban insurgents back from major provincial centers.
The United States has stepped up its assistance to Afghan security forces and its air strikes against the Taliban and other militant groups, aiming to break a stalemate and force the insurgents to the negotiating table.
MESSAGE TO TRUMP 
However, the Taliban have dismissed suggestions they have been weakened and said Saturday's bombing was a message to President Donald Trump.
""The Islamic Emirate has a clear message for Trump and his hand kissers, that if you go ahead with a policy of aggression and speak from the barrel of a gun, don't expect Afghans to grow flowers in response,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement, using the term the Islamist militants use to describe themselves.
The United States and Afghanistan have accused neighboring Pakistan of helping the Taliban in a bid to undermine old rival India's growing influence in Afghanistan.
Ghani, speaking alongside visiting Indonesian President Joko Widodo, said the Taliban claim of responsibility for the Saturday blast, even though it inflicted so many civilian casualties, showed that their ""overlord"" wanted to make a statement of defiance.
But Pakistan, which denies accusations it fosters the Afghan war, condemned the attack on Monday as it did the Saturday blast, saying it reiterated its ""strong condemnation of terrorism"".
The surge of violence is unlikely to sway the U.S. strategy, or breathe life into stalled efforts to get peace talks going.
The U.S. military and the Afghan government say big attacks on civilians are evidence that the militants are being squeezed in the countryside.
Trump condemned the Saturday attack, saying it ""renews our resolve and that of our Afghan partners"".
""We will not allow the Taliban to win!"" he said on Twitter on Sunday.
Ghani, embroiled in confrontation with provincial powerbrokers defying central rule, faces anger from an increasingly frustrated population, who want him to set aside political divisions and focus on security.
""People think the government is working very badly, that the security agencies think about themselves and don't care, and the international coalition just wants to fight with air strikes and doesn't have any good intelligence,"" said Najib Mahmood, political science professor at Kabul University.
Saturday's blast in one of the most heavily protected parts of the city, close to foreign embassies and government buildings, was the worst in the Afghan capital since a truck bomb near the German embassy killed 150 people in May.

The May blast triggered bloody anti-government protests but there has been no sign of any such agitation this week.

502,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>","North Korea cancels joint performance with South Korea, blames South media: Seoul","By Christine Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has canceled a joint cultural performance with South Korea scheduled for Feb. 4 blaming South Korean media for encouraging ""insulting"" public sentiment regarding the North, South Korea's unification ministry said on Monday.
The North said it had no choice but to call off the performance, which was to be held in the North Korean territory of Mount Kumgang, as South Korean media continued to insult what Pyongyang called ""sincere"" measures regarding the Winter Olympics Seoul will host next month, the ministry said.
Early in January, North and South Korea launched rare talks to bring North Koreans to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics after the North's leader Kim Jong Un said he was willing to open up discussions with Seoul.
The two Koreas had been in discussions regarding final details over the joint performance. They were also talking about a different concert in South Korea by a North Korean orchestra and sending South Korean athletes to train at a North Korean ski resort.
The North added that the agreement on the Mount Kumgang joint performance had come despite conflict with its internal celebrations, the unification ministry said. North Korea has at least two major holidays coming up next month - Kim Jong Il's birthday and a military founding anniversary.
Seoul said North Korea's decision to cancel the joint performance was ""very regrettable"" and stressed Pyongyang should uphold all agreements made between North and South Korea.
President Moon Jae-in's administration has faced criticism for its response to North Korea's participation in the Games, especially after it decided to form a combined women's ice hockey team with athletes from the two Koreas for the Winter Olympics. 
Many South Koreans have complained the unified women's hockey team - the only such joint team to be formed - was unfair to the South Korean players, going so far as creating over a hundred petitions against the unified team on the presidential Blue House's website.

The controversy has sent South Korean President Moon Jae-in's overall approval rating below 60 percent for the first time since he took office in May last year, according to a survey released last week by South Korean pollster Realmeter, dropping more than 6 percentage points since the previous week.

503,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",Egyptian politician emerges as sole election challenger to Sisi,"CAIRO (Reuters) - An Egyptian politician emerged just ahead of a deadline on Monday as the sole challenger to President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in an election in March the incumbent is set to win after other candidates withdrew citing repression.
Mousa Mostafa Mousa leads the Ghad party that has endorsed Sisi for a second term and even organized events to help nominate the former military commander as recently as last week.
Sisi was elected in 2014, a year after leading the army to oust President Mohamed Mursi, an Islamist. It is the third election since protests in 2011 unseated long-time ruler Hosni Mubarak.
Several leading opposition figures called on Sunday for an election boycott, blaming repression that has cleared the field of challengers and left Sisi's top opponent in jail.
At the time of Mousa's registration, his personal Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page included a cover photo with Sisi's face and ""we support you as president of Egypt"" written beneath it.
""We were supporting President Sisi before the decision to participate was taken,"" deputy head of the Ghad party Mahmoud Mousa told Reuters.
""We have a respectable program that we are offering to the Egyptian people and we are presenting ourselves just like any other candidate would,"" he said. 
Mousa said he registered his candidacy at the electoral commission after having collected the required number of nomination pledges, submitting his official paperwork just minutes before the final deadline.
Would-be candidates were required to register by 2 p.m. (1200 GMT) on Monday after clinching at least 20 nominations from parliament or 25,000 pledges from citizens across the country.
Mousa said he had netted 47,000 pledges and the backing of 27 lawmakers. The electoral commission said last week that Sisi had earned more than 1 million pledges. Over 500 of parliament's 595 lawmakers had already pledged support for Sisi. 
The vote, slated for March 26-28, has come under heavy criticism from the United Nations, rights groups, and opposition figures who say its environment has been compromised by intimidation of opposition supporters, arrests, and a nomination process stacked in favor of the incumbent.
The electoral commission has said that it will ensure the vote is fair and transparent.
The last-minute bid comes days after Hisham Genena, a former anti-corruption watchdog chief who had been working to elect former military chief of staff Sami Anan, was attacked and badly wounded outside his home on Saturday.
Anan's campaign was abruptly halted after he was arrested last week and accused of running for office without military permission.
Following the attack, a group of prominent figures including members of Anan's campaign, former Islamist presidential candidate Abdel Moneim Abol Foutoh, and Mohamed Anwar Sadat, who halted his own presidential bid out of concern for the safety of his campaigners, called for a boycott.

They said the state's policies were paving the way for extended limits to presidential terms and were ""removing any opportunity for the peaceful transfer of power"".

Two more officers died, and one was wounded just before midnight on Saturday in the rural Bolivar province, and the third attack took place about four hours later in the city of Soledad, injuring five police and one civilian.
""The authorship of these terrible actions is on the head of the National Liberation Army,"" Defense Minister Luis Carlos Villegas told local Caracol Radio, adding that the violence raised the question of whether the group wants peace.
The ELN and the government have been in formal peace talks for nearly a year, and the two sides agreed to their first-ever ceasefire in October. However, the guerrillas launched a new offensive when the ceasefire expired this month, killing security force members, bombing major oil pipelines and kidnapping an oil contractor.
In a statement on its main website on Monday, the ELN said it would support a new ceasefire but that attacks would continue in the absence of one. 
President Juan Manuel Santos, who said the government would not rest until the perpetrators of the bombings were found, will speak about the future of the talks later on Monday, Villegas said. Santos had recalled the government's negotiator at the Quito talks after the renewed offensive this month.
A man arrested after the first bombing in Barranquilla had been detained in 2015 in connection with an ELN cell, Villegas said, and the group was also responsible for a police station bombing in Ecuador on Saturday. No one was killed in that attack.
The urban front of the ELN put out a statement over the weekend claiming responsibility for the Barranquilla bombing, but others inside the organization said on Sunday they could not verify its authenticity.

505,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 09:08AM ET</span>",Merkel's embrace splits German Social Democrats over party identity,"By Joseph Nasr
GOERLITZ/COTTBUS, Germany (Reuters) - Cozying up to Angela Merkel, putting power above principles and jeopardizing the party's identity: this is how Social Democrats in the eastern German town of Goerlitz see their leaders' call to share power with the conservative chancellor.
They fear that renewing a coalition with the conservatives that has governed Germany since 2013 will further alienate voters, who in September handed the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) its worst election result since the post-war republic was founded in 1949.
SPD leader Martin Schulz's decision to renege on an election promise to end the alliance and go into opposition has provoked strong resistance in the party. His U-turn, made after Merkel failed to agree a deal with two smaller parties, has cast doubt on whether the 440,000 SPD members will approve a final coalition program that he is negotiating with the chancellor.
""This is a fight about our identity,"" said Gerhild Kreutziger, a 59-year-old educational consultant who leads the SPD's 60-member branch in Goerlitz.
""The coalition negotiations are less about SPD policies and more about continuing a harmonious coalition with Merkel. How can you implement good policies if you don't clash?,"" she added, discussing the state of the party with two SPD colleagues in a local cafe.
Goerlitz, a historic town on the Polish border, has experienced up and downs like many smaller east German communities since the fall of communism. It attracted investment from two major industrial employers, Siemens and Canada's Bombardier, but both are now planning hundreds of layoffs locally.
The coalition negotiations with Merkel have split the SPD across Germany and sparked a debate about how the party, which last won a national election in 2002, can restore trust with working-class voters who had formed the backbone of its support.
The problem is not unique. Socialist parties across Europe, especially in the Netherlands, France and Italy, have bled support to rivals offering a nationalistic alternative to voters who feel threatened by globalization and immigration.
Should Schulz agree terms with Merkel, SPD members will have to approve the deal in a postal ballot expected to be held in February.
Gauging the overall party mood is difficult. However, Kreutziger said 17 of the 20 members who attended a meeting in Goerlitz this month to discuss the ballot said they would vote against four more years with Merkel, convinced that the party could restore its credibility with voters only in opposition.
DILEMMA
Gudrun Dreischaerf, a 71-year-old former SPD voter, accused Schulz of talking more about reforming the European Union than bread-and-butter issues such as job security - an especially sensitive issue in the post-communist east where unemployment at seven percent compares with five percent in the west.
Dreischaerf switched to the hard-left Linke party, whose founders included ex-members of the defunct east German communist party, in the late 1990s in protest at pro-market economic reforms by then SPD chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
""Europe is not the top priority for people here,"" she said outside the town hall in Cottbus, a largely working class city 100 km (60 miles) north of Goerlitz. ""People want better jobs for their children. Temporary work and limited contracts were unheard of in my generation."" 
But SPD members in Cottbus believe their party would bleed more support if it went into opposition. Many voters want it to govern with the conservatives to end deadlock resulting from Merkel's failure to form a government with the Free Democrats and Greens.
Recent polls show the SPD falling below even the 20.5 percent it won in the inconclusive September vote. 
""People are confused,"" said SPD lawmaker Ulrich Freese, who represents Cottbus in the Bundestag.
""Some people won't vote for us because we are not going into opposition,"" he told Reuters. ""On the other hand if we don't go into government, many more wouldn't want to vote for us because we would have denied them good policies in the fields of employment, welfare, education and Europe.""
In Cottbus, a majority of the 262 SPD members will vote for the coalition agreement, said Gerhard Wenzel, who manages the party's office in the city.
Still, opponents of another alliance with Merkel put the party's problems down to its record of serving as a junior coalition partner during two of her three terms in office.
This alienates leftist voters who have come to associate the SPD with Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Christian Social Union (CSU) Bavarian allies. The SPD has also struggled to score points with the public for its signature policies such as a minimum wage and state pension increases, because the measures were implemented jointly with the conservatives.
""MERKEL WILL BE GONE""
""The CDU/CSU are good at taking credit for our policies as if they were their own,"" said Bettina Kauschinger, a 53-year-old who works in a hospital in Goerlitz, discussing the SPD's election campaign with Kreutziger.
Schulz lifted the SPD in opinion polls soon after his election as party leader a year ago, promising to make German society more equal.
But the surge fizzled out as his pitch failed to resonate in a country that overall has enjoyed a boom: the economy has grown in 11 of the 12 years Merkel has been in power and unemployment nationally is at a record low and falling.
Both camps in the SPD believe their party will have a better chance of winning once the chancellor finally goes.
A failure of the coalition talks would threaten her future and probably lead to an election re-run. Even if she succeeds, many Social Democrats doubt she will last a full term.
""She is not going to lead the conservatives in the next election,"" Kreutziger predicted. ""She will be gone, Schulz will also be gone and we will have a level playing field.""
But the party will have to do more than just hope Merkel steps down.

""I can't tell the difference between the CDU/CSU and the SPD,"" said Sophie Olschewski, a 20-year-old student in Cottbus who voted for the Linke. ""I'd rather have a strong opposition.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis called on European countries on Monday to do more to fight anti-Semitism, saying indifference on the issue was a virus that could allow the ideas of racial hatred to spread.
Francis issued his appeal in a speech to a Rome conference on the responsibility of states to fight anti-Semitism and crimes associated with it.
""We are responsible when we are able to respond. It is not merely a question of analyzing the causes of violence and refuting their (anti-Semitic crimes') perverse logic, but of being actively prepared to respond to them,"" he told the event organized by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
A number of European nations have made it illegal to deny the Holocaust, the Nazi attempt to exterminate European Jewry during World War Two.
Last week, Germany's lower house of parliament called for the creation of a new government post to oversee the fight against anti-Semitism, following the burning of Jewish symbols and Israeli flags.
""Indifference is a virus that is dangerously contagious in our time, a time when we are ever more connected with others, but are increasingly less attentive to others,"" the pope said.
Francis, who made an emotional visit to the former Nazi death camp at Auschwitz in 2016 and visited Rome's synagogue the same year, said the ""vaccine"" against ""so many deplorable forms of apathy"" is memory.
Quoting his predecessor, Pope John Paul, Francis said everyone should work for a future where ""the unspeakable iniquity of the Shoah will never again be possible."" Shoah is the Hebrew word for the Holocaust.
Poland, where Auschwitz is located, has also seen acts of anti-Semitism recently.
One, exposed by a television station, showed people in a forest last year chanting ""Sieg Heil"" on what would have been Adolf Hitler's 128th birthday.
About 60,000 people, some carrying banners with slogans such as ""pure blood, clear mind,"" marched in a far-right demonstration in Warsaw in November and arsonists set fire to a synagogue in Sweden last month.
Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, said: ""In country after country, we are watching a growing wave of far-right, ultra-national, and in some cases neo-Nazi parties gaining strength.""

""New Europe is suddenly looking an awful lot like the Europe of the 1930s,"" Lauder told the conference held at Rome's foreign ministry.

508,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 08:49AM ET</span>",Turkey detains 300 people over criticism of Syrian offensive,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey has detained more than 300 people for social media posts criticizing its military offensive in Syria, the government said on Monday, a day after President Tayyip Erdogan accused doctors who opposed the campaign of betrayal.
Since launching its 10-day-old air and ground offensive against the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria's northwestern region of Afrin, Turkish authorities have warned they would prosecute those opposing, criticizing or misrepresenting the incursion.
The Interior Ministry said on Monday a total of 311 people had been held for ""spreading terrorist propaganda"" on social media in the last 10 days. Detainees have included politicians, journalists and activists.
Turkey considers the U.S.-backed YPG, which controls Afrin, to be a terrorist group and an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which has fought an insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast since 1984.
The military operation has been widely supported by Turkey's mainly pro-government media and by most political parties, with the exception of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP). But there have been dissenting voices.
Over the weekend, Turkish media reported that 170 artists had written an open letter to lawmakers from Erdogan's ruling AK Party calling for an immediate end to Turkey's incursion.
Last week the Turkish Medical Association (TTB) denounced the cross-border operation, saying ""No to war, peace immediately.""
On Sunday, Erdogan accused the union of treason. ""Believe me, they are not intellectuals at all, they are a gang of slaves. They are the servants of imperialism,"" he told AK Party members in the northern province of Amasya.
""This 'No to war' cry by this mob ... is nothing other than the outburst of the betrayal in their souls ... This is real filth, this is the honorless stance that should be said 'no' to,"" Erdogan said.
Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said on Twitter on Saturday that the TTB and the Turkish Engineer and Architect Chambers Association (TMMOB), which has backed the medics, cannot use the word ""Turkish"" in their names, saying they did not represent Turkish medics, engineers and architects.
In a statement on Friday, the TTB said it rejected the accusations directed at it, adding remarks by senior government officials had made it a target of attacks. The Interior Ministry said later it had started an investigation into the association's actions.
On Monday, prosecutors launched an investigation into 11 members of the TTB's central administration over the association's ""war is a public problem"" remarks, the Hurriyet newspaper reported.
Since a failed coup in 2016, Ankara has enforced a crackdown that saw more than 50,000 people jailed and 150,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs, including members of the pro-Kurdish opposition party. The government says the moves were necessary given the security threats Turkey faces.
Critics accuse the government of unjustly targeting pro-Kurdish politicians. Some lawmakers from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) have been jailed on terrorism charges, which they deny.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The leaders of Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan on Monday set a one-month deadline for laying out the ways to break a deadlock in talks over a mega dam Addis Ababa is building along its share of the Nile, an official said.
Egypt and Ethiopia are at loggerheads over the construction of the Grand Renaissance Dam, a $4 billion-hydroelectric project that Cairo fears will reduce waters that run to its fields and reservoirs from Ethiopia's highlands and via Sudan. 
Ethiopia, which is financing the project alone and hopes to become the continent's biggest power generator and exporter, dismisses the claims. Sudan supports the dam because it will regulate floods and provide electricity and irrigation. 
Talks between the three governments have stalled for months over disagreement on the wording of a study on the dam's environmental impact. 
On Monday, Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and his Sudanese counterpart Omar Hassan al-Bashir met Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn on the sidelines of an African Union summit in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.
""They instructed their water and energy ministers to draw up in one month a report that thrashes out ways to resolve all outstanding issues regarding the dam,"" an Ethiopian official who attended the talks told Reuters.
The leaders have also agreed to hold heads of state meetings annually, and to set up a fund with the aim of building infrastructure such as a railway linking the three countries, he said.
At the meeting, Hailemariam said the project ""was never intended to harm any country but to fulfil vital electricity needs and enhance development cooperation in the region"", according to a report by state-run Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation.
Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia have agreed to finish the initial technical study within one month, the Egyptian state news agency said, citing the foreign minister. 
Tensions over the use of the world's longest river have long simmered between the Egypt and Ethiopia, raising fears the disputes could eventually boil over into conflict.
A major source of disagreement over the construction of the Grand Renaissance Dam is the speed at which its reservoir would be filled.
Now over 60 percent complete, the dam will produce 6,000 MW upon completion. It is centerpiece to Ethiopia's ambitious power exporting plans.

Sudan and Ethiopia have also previously expressed concern over a proposed baseline from which a study by a French firm commissioned to assess the dam's environmental and economic impact would measure the dam's effects.

GAZA (Reuters) - Schools, clinics and food distribution centers in the Gaza Strip were closed on Monday due to a one-day strike by the 13,000 employees of the United Nations agency that serves the Palestinians.
The Palestinian employees have been angered by a U.S. decision to cut its annual contribution toward the running of the United Nations' Relief and Welfare Agency (UNRWA), which runs 278 schools in Gaza attended by some 300,000 students.
The UNRWA is funded mainly by voluntary contributions from U.N. member states, with the United States by far the largest donor. Washington announced on Jan. 16 it would hold back $65 million - more than half its planned contribution this year - and demanded that the agency make unspecified reforms.
Those joining Monday's strike said the U.S. funding cut would worsen hardship in the Gaza Strip, and they marched to the U.N. headquarters in Gaza City waving Palestinian flags and brandishing banners that read ""Dignity is priceless"".
""I have a family of nine and I have never felt afraid for my job like today. U.S. aid cuts will affect the entire community,"" said 59-year-old English teacher Ahmed Abu Suleiman.
UNRWA spokesman Abu Hasna said the agency, which has launched an international appeal for funds, had enough money for three months of operations.
""We appreciate the fear and concern of employees for their jobs and for possible cuts in services,"" he said.
More than half of the two million people in the Gaza Strip are dependent on support from UNRWA and other humanitarian agencies. Unemployment in the enclave stands at 46 percent.
The strike comes amid Palestinian anger over U.S. President Donald Trump's Dec. 6 decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Trump criticized the Palestinian leadership for refusing to meet Vice President Mike Pence during his visit to the region and suggested such behavior provided grounds for cutting aid.
""When they disrespected us a week ago by not allowing our great vice president to see them, and we give them hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and support, tremendous numbers, numbers that nobody understands -- that money is on the table and that money is not going to them unless they sit down and negotiate peace,"" Trump said.

UNRWA was established by the U.N. General Assembly in 1949 after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war that followed the creation of the state of Israel.

The announcement came as the justice department filed its first criminal case against police officers in the battle against drugs, bolstering human rights activists' accusations of fabricated accounts of shoot-outs with drug suspects. 
The program of visits, known as ""Oplan Tokhang"", made a comeback with an assurance from police chief Ronaldo dela Rosa that it should be free of violence if offenders agreed to go quietly and did not resist.
But he could not promise a ""foolproof anti-drug campaign that would be bloodless"", Dela Rosa added, as the police were ""not dealing with people who are in their proper state of mind"". 
In the dialect of Duterte's southern hometown of Davao, ""Tokhang"" is a combination of the words ""knock"" and ""plead"".
Besides the visits, police have also run so-called ""buy-bust"" or sting operations and raided suspected drug dens and illicit laboratories.
In many of these operations, say rights activists, suspects did not get the chance to surrender, but were executed in cold blood instead. But police insist suspects died because they violently resisted arrest.
Nearly 4,000 drug suspects have died in gun battles with police since June 2016, when Duterte came to power. The government lost 85 police and soldiers in the drugs war, police data show. 
More than 1.2 million people had also turned themselves in after the home visits.
Duterte has stopped police anti-drugs operations twice due to questions over the conduct of the force, including the killing of a teenager in a supposed anti-drug operation.
On Monday, the justice department filed murder charges and two drug-related cases against three police officers who killed the teenager, Kian Loyd delos Santos, after witnesses disputed the police version of the killing.
National police spokesman Dionardo Carlos said the force welcomed the filing. 
""The police officers have to face their accusers in court and prove their innocence, they have to follow the procedures,"" he said, urging due process for the officers.
To ensure transparency, Dela Rosa invited human rights advocates, priests and the media to join the relaunched program of home visits. 
The police officers involved would also undergo a vetting process to weed out ""rogue"" officers, said Dela Rosa, adding that past abuses had involved the police seeking bribes to drop the names of people from the lists they compiled. 

""We are certainly hoping that it will be less controversial, because controversy will only blur the real intention, which is really the fight against dangerous drugs,"" Harry Roque, Duterte's spokesman, told a regular media briefing.

Wang stepped down from the seven-man Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of power in China, during a leadership reshuffle in October at the end of the once-in-five-years Communist Party Congress, amid intense interest in whether he would leave the post.
Aged 69, Wang had reached the age at which top officials tend to retire, but sources with ties to the leadership have told Reuters Xi could keep him on in some capacity, thanks to his loyalty and history of successfully tackling tough issues such as corruption.
Wang has been appointed a delegate to the largely rubber stamp parliament from the southern province of Hunan, according to a notice on the official Hunan Daily's WeChat account that lists all the province's parliamentary delegates. 
Wang was previously a parliament delegate from the same province.
The notice gave no other details or reason why Wang had been kept on as a delegate, and it was not possible to reach him for comment.
The move is significant because if Wang does not retire, that could set a precedent for Xi to stay on in power after he completes the traditional two terms in office. 
The national parliament opens in March, and provinces are now selecting their delegates to it.
It is unclear what new role Wang could be given, though leadership sources and diplomats say he might become the country's new vice president, with a possible focus on relations with the United States.
The State Council Information Office, which doubles as the party spokesman's office, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Wang, who keeps a low public profile but is often described as China's second most powerful politician, has not been totally out of the limelight since the end of the congress, for example, attending a banquet Xi hosted for U.S. President Donald Trump in November.
Wang was at the forefront of Xi's anti-corruption push launched some five years ago as head of the party's graft fighting Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which has been responsible for jailing dozens of top officials.
He has a strong economic background also, previously serving as a vice governor of the central bank, and, as a vice premier with an economic portfolio, helped oversee China's recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis.

Wang has experience managing relations with the United States too, heading the China delegation for the economic track at the once annual U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue.

Two women, Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong, a Vietnamese, have been charged with four North Korean fugitives for the murder. Prosecutors say the women smeared his face with VX, a lethal chemical poison at Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13. 
Defence lawyers say the women thought they were playing a prank for a reality show. They face the death penalty, if convicted. 
Kim arrived in Malaysia on Feb. 6 before traveling two days later to Langkawi Island, a tourist spot off Malaysia's west coast, the lead police investigator in the case, Wan Azirul Nizam, told the court.
But he was unable to confirm numerous details, saying he could not recall the name of the hotel where Kim stayed and did not know the name of the American man seen meeting with the North Korean on Feb. 9.
""Until today, the identity of the person being referred to could not be obtained,"" he said.
Siti Aisyah's lawyer, Gooi Soon Seng, had questioned Wan Azirul on a May 2017 report in the Japanese daily, Asahi Shimbun, that Kim had met a U.S. intelligence agent in Langkawi. 
The report said Kim was believed to have passed a large amount of data to the agent, citing a Malaysian forensics analysis of a laptop found in Kim's backpack after his death. 
Wan Azirul confirmed the laptop was sent to a forensics laboratory in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, which found the computer had last been used on Feb. 9.
The forensics report, provided to reporters at the hearing, also showed some data had been accessed from a USB pendrive inserted into the laptop on the same day.
But Wan Azirul said he was unsure whether Kim had passed on data in Langkawi or if the meeting was linked to the airport murder. 
Gooi accused the police witness of being evasive. 
""Come on, you have a total lapse in memory?"" he told Wan Azirul. ""You say you investigated but you've forgotten everything? Which hotel? What was this investigation for, if it wasn't related to this case?""

The trial resumes on Tuesday.

The judgment is seen as a victory for ethnic and religious minorities in the Muslim-majority nation who are pushing for greater recognition of their rights, amid what critics see as growing Islamic conservatism in its government.
Five judges of Malaysia's Federal Court said it was unconstitutional for just one parent to convert a minor to their religion.
""Both parents have equal rights,"" the Star Online news site quoted one of the judges, Zainun Ali, as saying. 
""The word ‘parent’ - is a case of being lost in translation,"" she added, referring to a Malaysian constitutional provision.
The decision upholds a lower court ruling in favor of Indira Gandhi - who challenged the conversion of her three children by her Muslim-convert former husband in 2009.
The conversion of her three children was null and void, the judges added.
Until now, the unilateral conversion of minors by Muslim converts had left women with little recourse, as their complaints would be referred to a sharia religious court, where non-Muslims have no standing to make claims.
""It's a great victory for many, because finally these unilateral conversions will stop,"" said Kulasegaran Murugeson, Indira's lead lawyer.
Muslims make up about 60 percent of a population of about 30 million, although Buddhists, Christians and Hindus account for a significant minority.
The ruling leaves police with the responsibility to locate and return Indira's youngest daughter, taken away by her ex-husband, Muhammad Riduan Abdullah, in 2009, when she was 11 months old, Kulasegaran said.
Muhammad Riduan has yet to return the child and is believed to have gone into hiding, despite a 2010 high court order that awarded Indira custody of all three children.
However, police have not acted on that order until now, because of a conflict in the jurisdiction of civil and sharia courts.
""The police must go aggressively (to retrieve the child),""
Kulasegaran said. ""Locating Muhammad Riduan is not impossible, and any extra day that goes by will only add to the pain of Indira and her family.""
The police will now obey the court order to track down Muhammad Riduan and the girl, media quoted the inspector-general of police, Mohamad Fuzi Harun, as saying.
The verdict was a ""huge victory for all Malaysians"" and for women like Indira who have faced ""grave violations"" of their rights, said Malaysian rights group the Women's Aid Organisation. 
The opposition and civil society groups have criticized Prime Minister Najib Razak's administration for taking a more conservative tack, such as backing a bill to widen sharia courts' jurisdiction over Muslims in northern Kelantan state.
The government also faced criticism for dropping, as being unconstitutional, a family law change that would have brought cases of unilateral conversion within the purview of civil law.

The parties are trying to thrash out an agreement on the vexed issue of family reunions for asylum seekers allowed to stay in Germany, with some in the center-left SPD pushing for a more lenient approach.
But the conservatives are keen to present a tougher line on immigration issues to avoid losing more votes to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which surged into parliament for the first time after last September's election.
Talks on the family reunion issue broke off overnight without agreement, but Malu Dreyer, an SPD deputy leader, said the parties were in the ""final stages"" of clinching an accord.
Dreyer told Deutschlandfunk radio there was a will among the negotiators ""that we really reach an agreement today"".
Merkel, who failed to form a government in talks with two smaller parties late last year, needs the talks with the SPD to succeed in order to secure a fourth term as chancellor.
Her conservative bloc and the SPD governed Germany, Europe's biggest economy, over the previous four years from 2013 to 2017 in what is known as a 'grand coalition'. That government took the decision in 2015 to take in more than a million migrants and refugees, many of them fleeing conflicts in the Middle East.
On the asylum seekers issue, the SPD and conservatives agreed in a blueprint this month to limit to 1,000 a month the number of people who can join immediate family members granted protection in Germany.
But the SPD is trying to refine the agreement on family reunions for some accepted asylum seekers. The conservatives have so far rejected demands by the SPD to raise that number by introducing a so-called ""hardship"" clause.
Dreyer said the negotiating parties also had unresolved differences on health insurance and employment policy.

""But there we are also not miles away from a solution,"" she added.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's parliament is drafting proposed revisions to the national criminal code that could ban all consensual sex outside marriage, sparking alarm among activists who it would breach basic rights and could be misused to target the LGBT community. 
The parliamentary committee drawing up recommendations to change the Dutch colonial-era criminal code has still to finalize its proposals.
But a draft, seen by Reuters on Monday, included measures to criminalize extramarital sex, same-sex relations, and co-habitation, all of which were previously unregulated by law. 
Adultery is already deemed a crime in Indonesia, the Southeast Asian country with the world's largest Muslim population.
Last month, the Constitutional Court narrowly voted to strike down a similar petition filed by the Family Love Alliance, one of the conservative groups behind the move to push legislation through parliament. 
""The truth is the majority of religions in Indonesia hold the same values, so...(the revisions) are representative of the majority and of all cultures in Indonesia,"" said Euis Sunarti, a member of the Family Love Alliance, which likens itself to conservative evangelical Christian groups in the United States.
The parliamentary committee has been holding consultations with the public, taking the opinion of religious scholars, legal experts and rights groups over how to change the criminal code where it relates to extramarital sex.
Most political parties are reported to be for the changes, particularly those that outlaw gay sex. 
Few Indonesian politicians have voiced support for LGBT rights for fear of alienating a largely conservative voter base ahead of legislative and presidential elections next year. 
Parliament has debated revisions to the criminal code, including regulations on corruption, sex and alcohol, for many years. But after repeated delays it is expected to finalize proposals during coming weeks.
Rights activists say the proposals, if approved, would be difficult to police without violating privacy and could threaten social development.
""The draft law will create new discriminatory offences that do not exist in the current criminal code. It will slow down Indonesia's efforts to develop their economy, society, knowledge, education etc....if law enforcement agencies are busy policing morality,"" said Andreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch.
""It's sounding like the Acehnese sharia code,"" he added, referring to the ultra-conservative province at the northern tip of Sumatra island, which is the only Indonesian region to implement Islamic law. 
Activists are particularly worried the new law may be used to target the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community, which has faced rising hostility in recent years.
A recent survey found that nearly 90 percent of Indonesians who understand the term LGBT feel ""threatened"" by the community and believe their religion forbids same-sex relations. 
Junimart Girsang, a member of parliament from the nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party of Stuggle (PDIP), said same-sex relations could not be accepted in the country.
""In legal terms, religious terms and ethical terms, we cannot have that in our country,"" he said.

The United States could release reports as early as Monday detailing the possibilities for expanding sanctions against Russia, including a list of oligarchs and potential restrictions on the holding of Russian government debt.
Moscow and Washington remain at odds over U.S. allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, something Russia denies, as well as over conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.
It is not clear whether the U.S. reports will definitely trigger new sanctions, but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call that Russia regarded them as an unfriendly attempt to sway the March presidential election.
""We do think this is a direct and obvious attempt timed to coincide with the elections in order to influence them,"" said Peskov. ""We do not agree with this and are convinced that there will be no influence.""
Russia holds a presidential election on March 18, which opinion polls show incumbent Vladimir Putin should easily win.

""The publication of this list on its own doesn’t mean anything,"" said Peskov. ""It isn’t the start of a new sanctions wave. So we will have to analyze what will happen next.""

519,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",'Fog' of Ukraine's war: Russian's death in Syria sheds light on secret mission,"By Maria Tsvetkova
MOSCOW/Donetsk, Ukraine (Reuters) - In the fall of 2015, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine were introduced to a moustachioed new commander who, like his predecessors, went by the codename Tuman - ""fog"" in Russian.
Also like his predecessors, he appeared to be a Russian national. He signed documents as General Primakov. 
When he was killed while on official assignment to Syria two years later, it turns out that this name was also fake, a deception to hide Russia's central role in a conflict that Moscow and the rebels maintain was entirely homegrown.
In fact, Valery Asapov was a Russian general working undercover.
The Kremlin has repeatedly denied providing military support for separatists who rejected a new pro-Western leadership in Kiev in 2014 and set up two states in eastern Ukraine, where many people identify as ethnically Russian.
Five rebels independently told Reuters that Asapov was a commander in the armed forces in one of them, the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. 
Specifically, two of the rebels said, Asapov commanded the rebels' key armed division, the First Army Corps.
Asapov's younger brother Vyacheslav also confirmed that his brother was in Ukraine. 
""He was there. For an entire year,"" he told Reuters in September, several days after giving a eulogy at his brother's funeral. 
""How did he feel about it? He was okay with it, like any military man,"" he said by telephone from the Asapovs' hometown in the Kirov region, 800 km (500 miles) east of Moscow. 
Asked to comment on Asapov's case, the Kremlin said it had no information and suggested sending questions to the defense ministry. The ministry did not reply to a request for comment. 
Three rebels said Asapov was not the first general seconded to be their leader, and that there continues to be a rotation of Russians in charge of the rebel army. 
Asked whether the defense ministry of the Donetsk republic plays any military role, a senior separatist officer told Reuters: ""No. The defense ministry deals only with politics and humanitarian activities.""
The rebels who spoke to Reuters asked not to be named because they did not want to be identified giving away secrets.
Asapov's story once again shows a deeper Russian involvement in the conflicts in both Ukraine and Syria than Moscow has been willing to admit. It also shows the inner workings of the strategy of ""hybrid warfare"", whereby Russia projects power by putting undercover people in command of local forces without publicly risking large numbers of boots on the ground. 
SANCTIONS 
Russian President Vladimir Putin himself has said no Russian troops have ever been deployed in Ukraine, not at the beginning of the rebellion in the east and not anytime since. 
Asked about instances of Russian servicemen captured in the former Soviet republic, Putin said in one case that a group crossed the Russian border into the country by accident.
In a second case, he conceded that those captured may have included ""people who dealt with certain issues including in military sphere"", but added: ""that does not mean we have regular Russian troops there.""
Based on the accounts of Russian servicemen, their relatives and witnesses, Reuters has reported on Russian regular troops entering eastern Ukraine at least twice amid fierce fighting in late August 2014 and around the time of the battle for Debaltseve in the Donetsk region in February 2015.
Kiev and the West say Russia invaded eastern Ukraine and have imposed sanctions on Russia and on individuals believed to have been involved in the conflict and the earlier annexation of Crimea.
The Ukraine government's sanctions list includes more than a thousand Russian and Ukrainian citizens, including Russian military officers. Based mostly on intelligence from Ukrainian agencies, it is difficult to verify independently without Russia's cooperation.
Asapov's name was added in 2016, labeled by Ukrainian intelligence as a ""war criminal"" for his senior position in the separatist forces.
At the time of his Ukraine mission, Asapov was formally based in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, 60 km (37 miles) from the Ukrainian border, according to a 2015 media report noting his transfer and court documents related to his request that family members be named in his dossier so that they could be eligible for privileges attendant on his rank.
Near the end of his official assignment in Rostov in the summer of 2016, Putin gave him the rank of lieutenant-general, according to a decree published online.
When he showed up in Ukraine, Asapov wore a uniform without insignia, said one of the separatists who met him at the time.
When he was formally introduced to the fighters, ""we were told our commander had arrived,"" the senior officer said. 
Many rebel officers knew Asapov was a Russian general without being told, he said.
""It was clear anyway... If Russia sends aid, ammunition here, they need to watch it so that this wouldn't be embezzled,"" he said.
The officer saw that Asapov signed documents as Primakov, and only learned his real name when he saw his pictures in reports about his death in Syria.
Another of the rebels recognized him only after a Reuters reporter showed him a picture of his portrait at his grave.
The separatists' command denies Asapov was in Ukraine.
""Asapov wasn't in Donbass (eastern Ukraine) for sure,"" Eduard Basurin, a deputy commander and a spokesman of rebel forces, told Reuters.
A Reuters reporter saw Basurin at Asapov's funeral, however. Basurin said he met the general in Moscow in the spring of 2015.
TRAINING
While Russia's role in Syria is public, the depth of its involvement has also been obscured. Officially, it conducts air strikes in support of the Damascus government and has a limited presence of special forces and military advisers on the ground.
Asapov's official role in Syria was chief military adviser, according to the defense ministry announcement of his death. 
At his funeral, Russia's military chief of staff Valery Gerasimov said he was commander of Syria's Fifth Attack Troop Corps of volunteers.
The corps was introduced by the government at the end of 2016 as a new force that would end attacks against Damascus but has not been heard of since..
The military importance of such ""volunteer"" units in both Ukraine and Syria is unclear. In Ukraine, Asapov appeared to focus on training, the senior rebel officer said - when he arrived in 2015, most of the fierce fighting was over. 
He traveled to military installations from his headquarters in Bosse in southern Donetsk and requested daily reports about the situation on the ground, according to the officer, who did a few of the reports.
He also secured supplies - after his arrival many local recruits were issued new uniforms, which they earlier had to buy, the rebel officer said.
The general also ran the launch of a firing range on a field near the town of Torez, recently renamed Chistyakove, according to four separatists, including two who worked at the range. At the same range he organized a competition among tank crews, a so-called Tank Biathlon, popularized by the Russian military.
Vyacheslav Asapov said he was told his brother was on the frontline coordinating Syrian forces when he was killed by a shell, aged 51. He died on the spot, along with his translator.
He said Valery looked tired when they met for the last time during a short break between stints in Syria last June.
""I don't think anyone is eager to go there. Neither was he,"" Vyacheslav said. As for Ukraine, ""What was there to say? He didn't talk about it much.""

Asapov was buried on Sept. 27 with full military honors at the Federal Military Memorial Cemetery outside Moscow. Several days later, two small flags of the pro-Russian separatists appeared on his grave.

""I will discuss with President Putin Iran's relentless efforts to establish a military presence in Syria, which we strongly oppose and are also taking action against,"" said Netanyahu, without elaborating, before boarding a plane for the visit, scheduled to last several hours.
Israel's air force said last year it had struck suspected arms shipments to Iran's ally, the Lebanese Hezbollah group, around 100 times.
Netanyahu said he and Putin ""meet periodically in order to ensure the military coordination between the Israel Defense Forces and the Russian forces in Syria"".
Russia intervened in the civil war on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2015. Iranian forces, Hezbollah and other Shi‘ite Muslim militias also back Assad.
Israel fears Iran could be left with a permanent garrison in Syria, extending a threat posed from neighboring Lebanon by Hezbollah, which has an extensive missile arsenal and last fought a war with the Israeli military in 2006.
Netanyahu said he also planned to discuss with Putin ""Iran's effort to turn Lebanon into one giant missile site, a site for precision missiles against the State of Israel, which we will not tolerate"".

522,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 05:08AM ET</span>","U.N. says 100,000 Rohingya in grave danger from monsoon rains","By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - More than 100,000 Rohingya refugees huddled in squalid, muddy camps in Bangladesh will be in grave danger from landslides when the mid-year monsoon season begins, a U.N. humanitarian report said.
There are now more than 900,000 Rohingyas in the Cox's Bazar area of Bangladesh, after 688,000 fled violence in Myanmar that flared up in late August. Aid workers say the camps sheltering the new arrivals are completely inadequate. 
""Landslide and flood risk hazard mapping reveal that at least 100,000 people are in grave danger from these risks and require relocation to new areas or within the neighborhoods that they live in,"" the U.N. report said. 
""The lack of space remains the main challenge for the sector as sites are highly congested leading to extremely hard living conditions with no space for service provisions and facilities. In addition, congestion brings increased protections risks and favors disease outbreak such as the diphtheria outbreak currently escalating in most of the sites.""
Although a rapid vaccination program appears to have staved off the risk of cholera, 4,865 have confirmed, probable or suspected diphtheria, and 35 have died. 
The World Health Organization has vaccinated over 500,000 Rohingyas against diphtheria and on Saturday health workers began giving 350,000 children a second dose. The WHO also has 2,500 doses of anti-toxin, which is in short supply globally, to treat the deadly effects of the disease.
But a new health concern has arisen - mumps. The U.N. report said there had been an increase in cases in the past few weeks, and Rohingya refugees and host communities had never been vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which is rarely fatal but can cause complications such as meningitis.
Most of the Rohingya refugees - almost 585,000 - are in an overcrowded area called Kutupalong-Balukhali. 
""A high percentage of the land is unsuitable for human settlement as risks of flooding and landslides are high and are further aggravated by the congestion and extensive terracing of the hills,"" the U.N. report said.
""The anticipated flooding and landslides in the upcoming monsoon season will make a bad situation much worse.""
A recent engineering assessment said all roads in the camp would be inaccessible for trucks, and the World Food Programme is considering using porters to distribute food, minutes of a Jan. 24 meeting of aid agencies involved in logistics said.
The Bangladeshi government allocated 2,000 acres (809 hectares) for a new camp in Ukhia, prompting an influx of people before anything was ready.

""Humanitarian partners are now building necessary infrastructure in challenging conditions, with extremely limited space,"" the U.N. report said.

523,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 04:51AM ET</span>",Voting to survive: Romanians elect mayors despite graft record,"By Radu-Sorin Marinas and Luiza Ilie
DRAGOMIRESTI, Romania (Reuters) - Romanian mayor Dragos Vladulescu has a criminal conviction in a country with one of the EU's worst corruption records, and yet local voters keep re-electing him and many think he's doing a great job.
For Vladulescu's admirers, what matters is that their mayor has upgraded or built new schools, clinics and even churches during his 14 years at the town hall. 
On top of that, the Social Democrat has installed street lighting, mains gas and water supplies, as well as paving muddy roads in their community of Dragomiresti, which lies in lush hill country about 90 km (45 miles) northwest of Bucharest.
Voters in the wealthier European Union states to the west would take such services for granted, but not in Romania, which is still catching up after enduring a particularly brutal form of communism under Nicolae Ceausescu.
So when a court found Vladulescu guilty of conflict of interest in 2014 for granting public works contracts to a company owned by his son-in-law, people shrugged it off and two years later re-elected him for a fourth term.
""Things are going well, he has done many good things here,"" said 64-year-old pensioner Gheorghe Baicoianu, while municipal workers shoveled away snow from bus stops in the village center. ""I certainly voted for him, he deserved it.""
The fact that the mayor was handed a six-month suspended jail sentence seemed not to trouble Baicoianu. ""I am not interested in other issues, only what I can see with my eyes in the locality,"" he told Reuters.
Dragomiresti is by no means unusual in Romania, which came fourth from bottom of the 28 EU nations in a 2016 corruption perceptions index compiled by the anti-graft group Transparency International. 
That year Vladulescu's Social Democrat Party (PSD) was re-elected nationally even though its leader Liviu Dragnea has also got a suspended jail sentence: two years in a vote-rigging case.
Dragnea is now on trial for abuse of office and prosecutors have opened a separate inquiry on suspicions that he formed a ""criminal group"" to siphon off cash from state projects, some of them EU-funded. This involves a company once controlled by a county council that Dragnea headed until 2012. He denies all the charges.
SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP
Sociologist Daniel Sandu says part of the PSD's success is a close relationship between its national leadership and its mayors. This involves how government money to build infrastructure and pay social benefits is channeled to a local level, funding the kind of public works that have made Vladulescu and other mayors so popular. 
""One way or another, the ruling party needs to control these mayors because they are the ones who bring votes, and mayors need the party because it helps them get funds,"" Sandu, a researcher at the European University Institute, told Reuters. ""There is a symbiotic relationship.""
All parties that have governed Romania since the 1989 fall of communism have been accused of favoring their own mayors and county administrations in allotting funds. 
Dragnea created a multi-billion euro state-funded program in 2013 when he was regional development minister. Under this, money for rural and municipal infrastructure projects is now distributed to the counties by a deputy prime minister, without the need for overall government oversight.
Reuters calculations show that Social Democrat mayors have generally done well out of this National Programme for Local Development (PNDL).
For 2017-2020 PSD-controlled county councils have been earmarked, on average, 17 percent more than those controlled by the opposition Liberal party, and about 40 percent more on average than counties run by leaders from Romania's ethnic Hungarian minority.
Dragnea's successor as regional development minister, Sevil Shhaideh, has denied preferential distributions. ""The poorest counties, with the largest populations and areas and with the most administrative units, will get the largest allotments,"" said Shhaideh, whose ministry drafted the PNDL allocations.
Shhaideh lost her ministerial post in a government reshuffle last October after prosecutors opened a corruption inquiry into her. She denies the allegations.
ALMOST FEUDAL
The European Commission has the Romanian judicial system under special monitoring, and the country's prosecutors are vigorously pursuing corruption cases, sending to trial hundreds of mayors, county councillors and lawmakers from across party lines.
The bulk of investigations involve public contracts awarded to firms in return for bribes, fraud with EU funds, rigged auctions and conflicts of interest. Jail sentences are, however, frequently suspended with relatively few officials behind bars.
Attempts by the PSD government to decriminalize several corruption offences last year triggered the country's largest street protests in decades. And yet the party, which won both the national and local elections, retains strong support.
Romania is booming, with the economy growing at annual rates of almost nine percent in 2017, but it remains poor. Per capita GDP was just 58 percent of the EU average in 2016, while 2011 data put Romanians' average annual earnings at less than 6,000 euros ($7,500) compared with almost 18,000 euros in Portugal, one of western Europe's poorest countries. 
Another problem is a disparity between cities such as Bucharest, which have largely benefited from Romania's transition to a market economy, and rural areas. 
""There are two very different Romanias,"" said Sandu. ""One feels like any prosperous and dynamic capital city in Europe. ""The other is served almost exclusively by a set of politicians who have developed an institutional power structure that is almost feudal.""
Outside the major cities, many small towns and villages lack basic services. A study by World Vision showed more than 200,000 children, particularly in rural areas, went to bed hungry.
The country has the highest rate of household deprivation in the EU, Eurostat data showed, with one in two Romanians struggling to keep their home warm or pay their bills on time.
For such people, spending by the local mayor is often a lifeline, so they vote for the candidate they think will produce the cash for their community.
""They are literally voting to survive,"" Sandu said. ""These people feel forgotten, abandoned, the losers of the transition and they believe their closest form of survival is the leader or party closest to them.""
AGING RAPIDLY 
Dragomiresti, a group of six villages with a total population of under 9,000, is far from the poorest municipality. 
But the community, which lies in Dambovita county, is aging rapidly. Most passersby in the center had family members working abroad, chiefly on farms in Spain and Italy.
Vladulescu, who won 58 percent of the vote in 2016, said he understood local concerns. ""Many mayors in Dambovita county have been re-elected for their second, third or fourth terms, and the key to their success is that they prioritize solving the problems of their citizens,"" he told Reuters. 
""I have done one thing or another every year in each village,"" he added. ""People understood very well how things stood; the fact they re-elected me is proof."" 
In 2016, many Romanians elected mayors who were under investigation or on trial, regardless of their party, including in cities such as Baia Mare and Brasov. 
Local administrations have an overall annual budget of just under 70 billion lei ($19 billion), a third of the country's consolidated budget revenue, and access to EU development funds. This includes funds from the PNDL, which the government has increased nearly fivefold to 30 billion lei for 2017-2020. 
Expert Forum (EFOR), an independent think tank which has analysed public contracts related to the PNDL in several counties, found that about half were awarded to only 5-6 private firms even though up to 50 compete for them.
""Connections are in most cases party-based and tend to be built around local power relations,"" an EFOR report said. ""Some companies are managed by unknown owners on paper but in reality they are controlled by politicians or other influential persons.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A group of Hong Kong lawyers on Monday condemned a ban on a democracy activist by the territory's government to prevent her from contesting a by-election, describing it as the suppression of free expression and a curb on voting. 
The weekend ban on Agnes Chow, a close ally of high-profile activist Joshua Wong, fuels wider fears of tightening political ""red lines"" by Beijing that could deny Hong Kong's restive young people any political outlet beyond street protest.
The 21-year-old Chow becomes the 13th politician barred from standing for office or disqualified from the legislature in recent years.
The group of 30 mostly liberal lawyers, including the current and former heads of the Bar Association, said they did not mean to endorse Chow's views, but wanted, instead, to protect candidates' freedoms.
""The decision has used political opinion or affiliation as a ground to deprive her of the right to stand for election – which is unreasonable, unlawful and unconstitutional,"" it said in a statement.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam took office last year, vowing to heal Hong Kong's political wounds, but her administration must also defend what Chinese President Xi Jinping has defined as ""red lines"" for the city: brooking no challenge to national sovereignty, security or the power of the central government.
The Asian financial hub has been governed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula since its return from British rule in 1997, allowing autonomy and freedom not enjoyed in mainland China, such as an independent judiciary and limited democracy.
Those freedoms, and Hong Kong's relationship with Beijing, are enshrined in the territory's mini-constitution known as the Basic Law that guarantees its capitalist way of life for 50 years.
The ban decision sparked anger among opposition leaders, who led a crowd of at least 2,000 people in protest against ""political censorship"" outside government headquarters on Sunday. 
""You are shutting the gates to us running for office,"" said a visibly upset Wong, just a few days after he was released from prison on bail pending appeal. ""We will open other gates to find a path for Hong Kong's democratic movement.""
Cases before Chow's involved radical candidates actively demanding independence or legislators who delivered profanity-laden oaths of office, but her disqualification effectively thwarts her Demosisto party, seen as an emerging outlet for the city's young people.

In calling for ""self-determination"", Demosisto leaders say they are not advocating independence but instead demanding a referendum on Hong Kong's future after 2047, which would include independence among other options.

China says Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamic extremists and separatists who plot violent attacks and stir up tensions between the mostly Muslim Uighur minority who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
In response, the government has organized mass police rallies and rolled out new surveillance and anti-terror measures throughout the region, including thousands of newly installed street-corner police stations in cities and towns.
A report first read at a government meeting on Jan. 22 by governor Shohrat Zakir and published on the official Xinjiang Daily newspaper said that 2017's campaign had made it clear that stabilizing society in Xinjiang would require more measures.
""There has been no fundamental change to the situation of Xinjiang being in a time of regular violent terror activities, an intense struggle against separatists and the painful throes of an intervention treatment,"" Zakir said. 
He added that the long-term peace and stability of Xinjiang and its society must be the overall goal of the regional government for the ""critical period"" of the next five years.
To meet this goal, the government will continue to deepen severe specialist operations, such as guaranteeing absolute security of key areas and the ""normalization"" of preventative measures in society, Zakir said.
China blames the violence in Xinjiang on Islamist extremists and separatists, some of whom it says have links to groups outside the country.

Rights groups and Uighur exiles say it is more a product of Uighur frustration at Chinese controls on their culture and religion. China denies any repression.

Reporters Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, who had worked on Reuters' coverage of the crisis in Myanmar's Rakhine state, will appear in a Yangon court on Thursday, when the prosecution is set to continue presenting evidence against them.
Panel chairman Surakiart Sathirathai, a former Thai foreign minister, said the case had progressed beyond the point where the board felt it could intervene. If it had been at the stage of arrests, ""then maybe we can do something about it"", he told the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper. 
Since the prosecution is in the midst of presenting its case, ""I think everyone has to respect the rule of law,"" he added.
Surakiart said he raised the issue ""on a personal basis"" with Myanmar's National Security Minister Thaung Tun.
""And he has assured us that the treatment of the Reuters reporters would be in accordance with the due process of law and proper criminal justice procedure,"" he added. 
""We have no intention to pressure the government to release anyone or any intention to interfere in the court procedures,"" the paper quoted Surakiart as saying.
Surakiart did not respond to a request from Reuters seeking comment.The two reporters have been jailed in Yangon's Insein prison since their arrests on Dec. 12.
The Advisory Board for the Committee for Implementation of the Recommendations on Rakhine State was set up by Myanmar last year, to advise on ways of adopting the findings of an earlier commission headed by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
ARGUMENT WITH SUU KYI
Last week, in an interview with Reuters, advisory board member Bill Richardson said he quit the panel after getting into an argument with Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi during a meeting on Monday with other board members, when he brought up the case of the two reporters.
Suu Kyi's response was ""furious"", saying the case ""was not part of the work of the advisory board"", said Richardson, a former governor of the U.s. state of New Mexico.
The argument continued at a dinner later that evening, when Richardson also brought up the issue of a mass grave where 10 Rohingyas had been killed and buried. 
""She was upset when I said there should be an investigation of the mass graves issue, that they had to increase their international support for the treatment of the Rohingyas, the terrible refugee crisis,"" Richardson said in a Reuters television interview. 
""She exploded. She was very unhappy, and it shows that she didn't want to hear frank advice.""
The military stated after its own investigation into the mass grave that security forces were involved in the killings.  
Suu Kyi's office said on Saturday it would not be commenting further on the exchange with Richardson. 
""We already published a statement and also the advisory board published a statement,"" said Zaw Htay, Suu Kyi's spokesman.
""The judge will decide whether the journalists committed the crime or not. Even in America, they wouldn't involve themselves in a case while the case is ongoing in a court hearing.""
Zaw Htay was not available for comment on Monday.
Around 688,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from Rakhine to neighboring Bangladesh after attacks on security posts in Rakhine on Aug. 25 triggered a fierce military response, which the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing.

JUBA (Reuters) - A South Sudanese rebel group said on Monday it had released 15 army soldiers it had been holding to The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), in line with a ceasefire agreed by the government and rebel groups last month.
SPLA-IO spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel told Reuters the rebel group had released the prisoners on Sunday and that it was collecting names of prisoners of war from battlefields across the Equatoria region, which borders Uganda. 
More prisoners will be released in the coming days, he said. 
International monitors have said the truce negotiated by the East African regional bloc IGAD in December -- which included a commitment to release detainees -- was violated within hours. 
Contacted by Reuters on Monday, the ICRC referred to a statement it released on Sunday saying it had ""informed parties involved in the conflict in South Sudan that it can facilitate any potential release of persons detained in relation to the conflict."" 
South Sudan descended into civil war in 2013 after clashes between troops loyal to former vice president Riek Machar and President Salva Kiir. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and a third of the population have fled their homes.

Babis has been trying to form a government since his landslide victory in an October election but failed to secure parliamentary support for a minority cabinet this month as he also battles allegations of subsidy fraud. He denies any wrongdoing. 
The Social Democratic Party (CSSD), Communists and the far-right anti-EU SPD party have said they might join a coalition with Babis' ANO party or support it from outside.
""We will continue negotiations with (those three parties), only in the case of CSSD we want to wait for their convention in February so that we know who in fact represents the party,"" Babis told Pravo newspaper in an interview published on Monday.
The Communists have said they want some of their program to be picked up by the government in exchange for their support, while the Social Democrats and SPD have said they will not back a government that includes a person charged with a crime.
Babis has meanwhile said he would not accept the current Social Democrat leader Milan Chovanec, a former interior minister, in the new government.
""After what I experienced with Mr. Chovanec, I definitely will not sit in a government with him,"" Babis told Pravo.
Zeman said after his narrow victory in the presidential election on Saturday that he would let Babis have more time to form a government.

Babis has insisted his cabinet will take a pro-EU course and not give in to demands to hold a referendum on leaving the European Union, as Britain did in 2016.

MANILA (Reuters) - Jeepneys, the flamboyant passenger trucks of the Philippines, are nearing the end of their reign as the ""Kings of the Road"", but they're not going down without a fight.
Government moves to overhaul outdated public transport, making it safer and more environment friendly, will put the brakes on a mode of travel that has long been the surest and cheapest option in a country of 105 million people. 
But the operators and drivers of the 200,000 jeepneys that have plied the nation's roads and highways for decades are defiant, denouncing moves to oust them as ""anti-poor"" and a threat to their livelihoods.
""It is a big hassle to us poor people since we are the ones suffering,"" said one jeepney driver, upset after traffic police pulled him over because his vehicle was belching black smoke.
Jeepneys have evolved from surplus army jeeps left behind by the U.S. military after World War Two to become brightly-painted vehicles festooned with religious slogans, horoscope signs or family names. 
At a cost of 8 pesos ($0.16) for a journey of 4 km (2.5 miles) in Manila, the capital, they are easily affordable, but the ride is far from comfortable.
A typical jeepney packs in 10 to 16 commuters, sitting knee-to-knee on twin benches, and lacks air-conditioning or windows to shield occupants from the heat, rain and choking fumes.
In Metro Manila, one of Asia's most gridlocked mega-cities, passengers can sit there for hours. 
There are no seatbelts and commuters have only ceiling bars to keep from being thrown off their seats as drivers race to beat traffic lights or edge out competitors for waiting passengers.
The government wants to force unsound and shabby jeepneys off the streets in favor of bigger, cleaner, safer and more modern replacements, some electric, others using cleaner fuel.
But drivers complain that the newer units, priced around 1.8 million pesos ($35,327), are prohibitively expensive, and government subsidies are paltry.
Some fear vested interests are at play.
""They only want to kick out the operators so they could let corporations take over,"" said George San Mateo, head of transport group PISTON, as he led a protest last week outside the transport regulator's office. 
""The government is using this crackdown on dilapidated and smoke-belching jeepneys to force poor operators to buy new ones they cannot afford.""
Regulators have said the plan, backed by President Rodrigo Duterte, aims simply to modernize public transport.
""There's a lot of public utility jeepneys which are old and dirty, so we have to address it,"" Martin Delgra, chairman of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, told reporters.
""We cannot compromise safety when it comes to roadworthiness.""

Ministers have been sent a legal letter warning that 50 million pounds of funding for the province, part of a 1 billion pound deal agreed between May and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - was unlawful because it was made without parliamentary agreement.
The challenge has been brought by Investment manager Gina Miller, who successfully won a court battle in 2017 to force the government to seek parliamentary approval before starting divorce talks with the European Union, and the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB).
""It beggars belief that this government is once again putting itself above the law and seeking to undermine the normal constitutional and legal processes,"" Miller said in a statement.
""Spending public money requires proper parliamentary scrutiny and accountability – and the making of these payments is no different.""
May called a snap election last June but lost her parliamentary majority and now relies on support from lawmakers in the small DUP to govern.
Miller and the IWGB say the government have broken an assurance given in August last year that payments to Northern Ireland could not be made without prior parliamentary approval.
Their lawyers have sent a letter demanding a response from ministers by Feb. 2 that any payment allocated to the British province will be returned and no further sums will be made without the agreement of lawmakers, or they will begin court action against the government.

The anti-immigrant Freedom Party, junior coalition government partner to Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservatives, was founded by former Nazis and has repeatedly excluded members in Nazi scandals. It says it has left its Nazi past behind.
The FPO's top candidate for elections in the province of Lower Austria, Udo Landbauer, was deputy leader of a fraternity that produced a songbook in 1997 that included references to killing Jews.
Authorities are investigating the issue.
President Alexander Van der Bellen eventually called for Landbauer to resign. 
Asked by ORF radio whether he can rule out stepping down, Landbauer, 31, said, ""Decidedly.""
Austria's main Jewish body, the IKG, and Israel have upheld their boycott of FPO officials even after they joined government last month upon gaining third place, with 26 percent of votes, in parliamentary elections in October.
The chief of Lower Austria's conservatives, which got around half of the votes in Sunday's elections, said she was ready to work with the Freedom Party, which gained 15 percent, but ruled out bringing Landbauer into the province's cabinet.

534,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2018 11:40PM ET</span>",Heat wave leaves thousands of Australian homes without power,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - More than 10,000 homes in Australia's second most populous state were stuck without power on Monday as a surge in demand amid scorching heat overloaded the grid, in the latest blow to the nation's stretched power sector.
The outages on distribution networks, which hit more than 50,000 homes on Sunday, came less than a year after Australia's biggest city, Sydney, was hit by blackouts during a heatwave, and 16 months after a state-wide outage in South Australia.
The latest blackouts, however, were caused by grid failures, rather than supply shortages, which had sparked a national debate over the nation's rush to adopt renewable energy at the expense of coal-fired generation.
Temperatures topped 40 degrees C (104°F) over the weekend in the state of Victoria, driving up power demand as homes cranked up their air conditioners and pool pumps and even forcing the Australian Open to close the stadium roof for the men's championship match on Sunday night.
Crews worked through the night to restore power, but some homes were likely to remain affected until Monday evening, United Energy, majority-owned by Hong Kong's CK Infrastructure Holdings, said.
""The prolonged high temperatures and humidity through the weekend ... resulted in multiple power outages,"" a United Energy spokeswoman said, adding that the main cause was fuse faults at overloaded substations.
The Australian Energy Market Operator, which coordinates energy supply from power stations and has been monitoring supply after last year's failures, said there was ample supply over the weekend, when demand hit a record for a Sunday.
""It was a really good test,"" said AEMO spokesman Stuart Allott, adding that there was more than 1,380 megawatts of spare capacity when Victoria's demand peaked on Sunday.
The market operator came under pressure last year to beef up power supply after the closure of one of Victoria's biggest power stations, but Australia has weathered a searing summer so far with the help of more gas-fired power and a huge battery installed by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc in South Australia.
Grid data in Thomson Reuters Eikon showed that Victoria required electricity imports from neighboring South Australia and Tasmania to meet its record demand.
Wholesale dispatch power prices in Victoria shot above A$3,000 ($2,425) per megawatt hour (MWh) on Sunday, compared with a usual price of below A$100 per MWh, but still well below the A$14,000 market price cap.
""The issues seem quite localized around specific residential distribution areas,"" said Andrew Koscharsky, director for energy at commodity trading house RCMA, which deals in Australian wholesale electricity.
Victorian state premier Daniel Andrews warned that distribution companies may have to pay compensation to customers.
""We will work with companies and we'll compel them, if we have to, both to look at compensation and to look at improvements in that network,"" he told reporters on Monday.
Temperatures are set to drop in the coming days, but the next heat wave is expected in early February.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand military planes on Monday were scouring a section of the Pacific Ocean for more survivors from a missing ferry after eight people were rescued from a dingy that was adrift for days.
The survivors, including an unconscious teenage girl, were safely transferred to a nearby fishing vessel late on Sunday, Defence Force Air Commodore Darryn Webb told Radio New Zealand.
The air search resumed at first light on Monday, he said.
The New Zealand Defence Force had originally said there were seven survivors, but later revised the number to eight in a statement.
The 17-metre (56-foot) ferry with 50 people on board was reported missing on Jan. 20, two days after it departed Nonouti Island on a 250-km (155-mile) trip to Betio in Kiribati.
""They (the search crew) will be feeling mixed emotions now that they've discovered a dinghy with some survivors but not everyone on board,"" Webb said.
The Defence Force believed there could be a life raft with more surviving passengers, he added.
""We remain optimistic that we may find some more survivors,"" he said.
New Zealand has been coordinating the search since Saturday and a Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3K2 Orion aircraft spotted the dinghy within two hours of reaching the search area on Sunday morning, the NZDF said in a statement.
Before it left Nonouti Island, the missing ferry, a wooden catamaran, underwent repairs to its propeller shaft after running aground.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Monday Australian military equipment manufacturers will be offered government-backed loans as part of a A$3.8 billion ($3.1 billion) package to become one of the world's top 10 defense exporters.
Australia said in 2016 it would boost defense spending by A$30 billion by 2021, purchasing frigates, armored personnel carriers, strike fighter jets, drones and a fleet of new submarines - many of which would be built at home.
The defense industry has struggled to obtain finance from traditional lenders that have been unwilling to fund the arms industry, so Australia has created a A$3.8 billion loan scheme for companies seeking finance to export military equipment. 
""Australia is around the 20th largest exporter. Given the size of our defense budget we should be higher up the scale than that,"" Turnbull told reporters in Sydney.
""The goal is to get into the top 10,"" he said.
Christopher Pyne, the minister for the defense industry, said Australia would target sales to the United States, Canada, Britain and New Zealand.
Australia's annual defense budget was worth A$34.6 billion this year.
The scheme is also meant to arrest a slide in Australia's manufacturing sector and provide some support for its economy, which has been hampered by record-low wage growth.
Australia saw a record number of jobs created in 2017 but its manufacturing sector has shrunk significantly following the end of domestic car manufacturing.
Employment in manufacturing peaked in mid-1989 at roughly 1.17 million, or 15 percent of the entire workforce. That shrank to 877,000, or 7 percent, late last year. 
Australia has seen a wave of new jobs but companies are not keen on paying employees more, leaving wage growth near record lows in an unwelcome drag on consumer spending and inflation.
Australia's expansion plans come amid increased global demand for military hardware, led by China and Middle East nations, prompting criticism of Canberra from aid agencies who argue Australia could make human rights violations worse if weapons were sold to the wrong buyers.
Analysts said Australia would need to significantly expand sales beyond its traditional partners to have any chance of fulfilling its ambition.
""There are possibilities, but I doubt U.S. interest especially will go beyond niche capabilities,"" said Euan Graham, director of the international security program at Australian think tank the Lowy Institute.

(Reuters) - Two-thirds of Americans are uncomfortable about the idea of riding in self-driving cars, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, underscoring one of many challenges for companies spending billions of dollars on the development of autonomous vehicles.
While 27 percent of respondents said they would feel comfortable riding in a self-driving car, poll data indicated that most people were far more trusting of humans than robots and artificial intelligence under a variety of scenarios.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll found a wide disparity of opinion by gender and age, with men generally more comfortable than women about using self-driving vehicles and millennials more comfortable than baby boomers. (http://tmsnrt.rs/2DD4h4W)
Among men, 38 percent said they would feel comfortable riding in a self-driving car and 55 percent said they would not. Among women, only 16 percent said they would feel comfortable and 77 percent said they would not. 
Among those skeptical of driverless cars was California resident Phoebe Barron. ""I don't want to be the first guinea pig,"" she said in an interview.
Colorado resident Sonja Coy told Reuters she had a more positive view. Self-driving cars ""are a great innovation and technology with a lot of potential,"" she said. 
""However, I'm concerned with how liability will fall in the case of accidents, where there are both self-driving and regular cars on the road,"" Coy said.
Like most people, she said she had not yet ridden in a self-driving vehicle. Companies testing the vehicles in the United States and elsewhere have provided limited public access so far.
""We're talking about abstract things that many people have not experienced firsthand,"" said Jeremy Carlson, principal automotive analyst with IHS Markit.
Automotive and technology industry executives are pushing U.S. lawmakers to pass legislation that would loosen restrictions on testing and deploying self-driving cars. However, the legislation is currently stalled in the Senate.
In the meantime, companies from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo are planning to deploy the first wave of self-driving vehicles over the next three years. 
Industry officials and analysts have said providing convincing reassurances about safety is an urgent task for advocates of autonomous vehicle technology.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted in mid-January and collected responses from 2,592 adults.

Other recent surveys have also highlighted widespread doubts among U.S. consumers about self-driving cars, in the absence of any direct experience with them.

The House of Lords Constitution Committee said in a report published on Monday that the legislation to end Britain's European Union membership has ""fundamental flaws"", including ministerial powers it considers too sweeping. 
""We acknowledge the scale, challenge and unprecedented nature of the task of converting existing EU law into UK law, but as it stands this bill is constitutionally unacceptable,"" said committee chairwoman Ann Taylor.
The legislation is likely to be given a rough ride by the largely pro-EU lawmakers in the upper house and comes as Prime Minister May battles rebellion within her own party over the best route out of the bloc, which Britain is scheduled to leave in March 2019. 
The Lords committee expressed concern that the government will use the Brexit process to reshape EU laws without proper parliamentary scrutiny as they move into British law.
""The bill grants ministers overly-broad powers to do whatever they think is 'appropriate' to correct 'deficiencies' in retained EU law,"" the report said. ""This gives ministers far greater latitude than is constitutionally acceptable.""
The committee also urged the government to reach agreement about which powers currently held in Brussels will return to Britain's central government and which will be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
The legislation was cleared by the House of Commons this month and will begin its journey through the House of Lords on Jan. 30. It is expected to take until the summer for it to become law.

ZARQA, Jordan (Reuters) - The United States has delivered the last batch of Black Hawk helicopters for Jordan's rapid deployment force to bolster border defenses and engage in cross-border operations against Islamic militants.
U.S. officials say that military aid to Jordan, one of the largest recipients of its foreign military financing, helps to build the kingdom's military capabilities as part of a wider regional strategy.
Washington has announced it plans to stay in Syria long after Islamic State has been defeated and has military bases in the northeastern part of the war-torn country.
In a handover ceremony attended by U.S. Central Command chief General Joseph Votel and Jordan's Chief of Staff General Mahmoud Freihat, the helicopters landed in a mock hostage rescue by special forces.
""The United States remains committed to supporting the Jordanian air force efforts to protect Jordan's borders and deter counter acts of terror and contribute to defeat ISIS coalition operations,"" said Henry Wooster, Charge d'Affaires of the U.S. Embassy in Jordan, during the ceremony at the King Abdullah air base 35 km northeast of the capital.
Congress appropriated $470 million in fiscal year 2017 for the Jordanian army with a big chunk to pilot training, spareparts, weapons and hangers for the twelve UH-60 Black Hawks, Wooster said.
The military aid deliveries address some concerns King Abdullah expressed last year to the administration of President Barack Obama and top U.S. lawmakers about lack of military funding and responsiveness to one of its key regional allies.
Later Votel told CNN the staunch U.S. ally was a key partner with the Pentagon in the region. 
""Jordan has been a fantastic partner for a number of years here, I think what you saw in our demonstration here today is the maturity of our relationship. Jordanians are operating top of the line equipment and doing a great job with it,"" Votel said.
Jordan is among a few Arab states that have taken part in a U.S.-led air campaign against the hardline militant group.
The Black Hawk helicopters are central to the U.S.-funded quick reaction force set up by Jordan to counter Islamic State, which remains a threat despite having been driven out of large areas of neighboring Iraq and Syria.
""The force is capable of moving troops and supplies anywhere in Jordan on short notice to reinforce border security and repel potential incursions,"" Wooster said.
U.S. Patriot missiles are stationed in the kingdom and the U.S. army has hundreds of trainers in the country.
Jordan's location makes it an ideal logistics and supply hub for the Unites States, including its Tanf garrison in the southeastern Syrian desert. 
""U.S. Jordanian military cooperation is very strong and a key component in our joint effort to defeat Daesh,"" said Brigadier General Jaber al-Abbadi, Jordan's air force commander.
The Pentagon was planning to spend several hundreds of millions of dollars in expanding and upgrading the Muwaffak Salti air base located near the Syrian-Jordanian border in the northern part of the country, a Western diplomat said.
Jordanian officials confirmed the expanding U.S. military aid program.
""Jordan is currently working with the U.S. to enhance our capabilities in the military, especially the air force,"" General al-Abbadi added.
Since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, Washington has spent millions of dollars to help Amman set up an elaborate surveillance system known as the Border Security Programme to stem infiltration by militants from Syria and Iraq.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland's moderate President Sauli Niinisto cruised to a rare first round election win on Sunday as his delicate balancing of ties with neighbor Russia and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance resonated with voters.
The 69-year-old Niinisto, known for cultivating good relations with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, won his second six-year term with an overwhelming 62.7 percent of the vote. His closest rival, Pekka Haavisto of the Greens of Finland, secured just 12.4 percent.
""I am very surprised at this kind of support. I must think hard how to be worthy of it,"" Niinisto told reporters.
""I have no intention of making changes just for the sake of making changes. We will follow very closely what is happening outside of Finland, globally, and if needed, then we will surely react.""
Pro-EU Niinisto became the first candidate to win a first round victory since the electoral system was changed to a direct popular vote in 1994.
Eurosceptic politicians, Laura Huhtasaari from the nationalist Finns Party and independent Paavo Vayrynen, won 6.9 percent and 6.2 percent of votes, respectively. Turnout was 69.9 percent.
During his first term, Niinisto was instrumental in maintaining relations with Moscow, despite the country backing western economic sanctions against Russia over its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
Finland, which shares an 833-mile (1,340 km) border and a difficult history with Russia, has also developed closer ties with NATO but stopped short of full membership in line with a tradition of avoiding confrontation with Russia.
The president is in charge of foreign and defense policy together with the government, but otherwise the post has become largely ceremonial in the past few decades.
Niinisto has appeared as a low-profile middle-man between East and West, in sharp contrast to his Baltic counterparts who regularly speak out against Moscow.
He was the first Western leader to meet Putin following the annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula, and he has also actively pushed for an air safety agreement in the Baltic region.
'FATHER OF THE NATION'
Niinisto hopes for the EU to strengthen its defense cooperation, and declines to lock in a stance on Finland's future NATO membership.
""I think there is no reason to seek a (NATO) membership as long as circumstances are as they are now,"" Niinisto said on Sunday. ""But if there are crucial changes in the environment, then we might be in a different situation.""
Niinisto originally belonged to the co-ruling, center-right National Coalition Party but campaigned this time around as an independent.
""When ties between European Union and Russia are tense, people are satisfied that Niinisto has been able to maintain pragmatic and functional dialogue with Russia,"" said Markku Jokisipila, director at the Centre for Parliamentary Studies of the University of Turku.
Apart from his long service in politics, Niinisto also taps into sympathy from many Finns because of a series of personal dramas.
A lawyer by training, he was finance minister in the 1990s, becoming known for his government's austerity measures following Finland's recession, as well as the decision to join the euro area.
He lost his first wife in a car accident in 1995. He was in Thailand during the deadly 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami and survived by climbing up an electricity pole with his son.
He expects a baby with his wife Jenni Haukio, 40.
""His habits reflect his experience and ordeal, and that combined with his very moderate policy statements makes him a kind of 'father of a nation' figure,"" said Juho Rahkonen, Research Manager at pollster Taloustutkimus.
The result underlined how presidential candidates are to a large extent given priority over their parties, analysts said.
Matti Vanhanen, a candidate from Prime Minister Juha Sipila's Centre Party, received only 4.1 percent of votes, while the biggest opposition party Social Democrats' candidate, Tuula Haatainen, won just 3.3 percent.

While around 20 percent of Finns back the idea of joining NATO, the only pro-NATO candidate, Nils Torvalds from the Swedish People's Party, won only 1.5 percent of votes.

JERUSALEM/WARSAW (Reuters) - Israel's prime minister and Holocaust survivors on Sunday bridled at a draft Polish law that would make it illegal to suggest Poland bore any responsibility for Nazi atrocities committed on its soil.
The Israeli foreign ministry summoned Poland's charge d'affaires - the ambassador was abroad – to object to the bill, which is still going through parliament.
""We will under no circumstances accept any attempt to rewrite history,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in lengthy public remarks to his cabinet.
Netanyahu and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki talked by phone late on Sunday, the Israeli leader's office said, and they ""had agreed to open immediate dialogue between teams from both countries to try to reach understandings on the legislation.""
Before World War Two, Poland was home to Europe's largest Jewish community of some 3.2 million. Nazi Germany attacked and occupied Poland in 1939 and later built death camps including Auschwitz and Treblinka on Polish soil. Most of the Jews that lived in Poland were killed by the Nazi occupiers.
The Polish government said in a statement the legislation aimed to stop the Polish people or state being blamed for Nazi crimes.
The bill, passed by the lower house of parliament on Friday, would make the use of phrases such as ""Polish death camps"" punishable by up to three years in prison. 
To become law, the bill, which could yet be amended, must be approved by the Senate and Polish President Andrzej Duda.
""We will accept no limitation on truthful historical research,"" Netanyahu earlier told his cabinet.
""Our ambassador in Warsaw, at my instruction, spoke with the prime minister of Poland during last night's ceremony commemorating the Holocaust at Auschwitz, and emphasized these positions of ours,"" he said, referring to a service to mark the 73rd anniversary of the death camp's liberation.
Warsaw says the bill will not limit freedom to research or speak about the Holocaust. 
""Jews, Poles, and all victims should be guardians of the memory of all who were murdered by German Nazis. Auschwitz-Birkenau is not a Polish name, and 'Arbeit Macht Frei' is not a Polish phrase,"" Morawiecki said on Twitter on Saturday.
The German phrase, which translates as ""work sets you free"", was set into the wrought iron gates at Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps.
The Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) said that Poland had been in the past many times presented as an ally of Hitler, which made it necessary to protect its reputation.
Poland lost about 3 million of its non-Jewish citizens, including many of its intellectuals and members of the elites during World War Two. The capital Warsaw was razed to the ground in 1944 after a failed uprising in which 200,000 civilians died.
BILL BANS ""POLISH DEATH CAMPS"" REFERENCE
Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust remembrance center, said the phrase ""Polish death camps"" would be a historical misrepresentation but that the bill was ""liable to blur the historical truths regarding the assistance the Germans received from the Polish population"".
At Israel's request, Duda's top policy adviser will meet Israel's ambassador on Monday to discuss the legislation.
Holocaust survivors interviewed in Israel's best-selling daily, Yedioth Ahronoth, gave first-hand accounts of how Poles refused them help or turned them over to German authorities.
""There were good Polish people ... but there were also Poles who were very cruel,"" Esther Lieber, 81, told the newspaper. ""When they came to round us up and put us in the ghetto, father said to run away quickly. We were very scared and fled into the woods. The Poles threw stones at us and cursed us.""

Yad Vashem says about 30,000 to 35,000 Jews, around one percent of all of Polish Jewry, were saved with the help of Poles. More than 6,700 Poles, the largest number of rescuers from a single country, have been honored by Yad Vashem as ""Righteous Among the Nations"".

More than 25,000 murders were recorded last year as rival drug gangs increasingly splintered into smaller, more blood-thirsty groups after more than a decade of a military-led campaign to battle the cartels.
Violence is a central issue ahead of the presidential election in July. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party is trailing in third place in recent polls. 
Sales said federal police troops would be deployed in the states of Colima and Baja California Sur, the resort town of Cancun and the border city of Ciudad Juarez, among others. He said more details would be forthcoming within days.
Earlier this month, the United States slapped its most stringent travel warnings on the states of Colima, Michoacan, Sinaloa, Tamaulipas and Guerrero, ranking them as bad as war-ravaged Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.
At least 25 people were murdered in Mexico this weekend, according to officials and local media, including nine men who were executed at a house party in a suburb of the wealthy northern industrial city of Monterrey.
Masked gunmen burst into a home in San Nicholas de los Garza as a group watched a local soccer team play on television, according to state prosecutors. Seven were killed at the scene and two more died later at a hospital.
There were a wave of attacks in night spots late Saturday and early Sunday. A group of armed men killed three people in a bar in the resort city of Cancun, a Chilean tourist was killed in the Pacific beach resort of Acapulco, and two more were killed in a bar in the capital of Veracruz state.

Six more were killed in the border city of Ciudad Juarez and four more died in the border state of Tamaulipas, where at least 10 were killed during the week at outlaw road blockades and in shootouts, local media reported.

HAVANA (Reuters) - U.S. supporters of improved relations with Cuba joined the top leadership of the Caribbean country on Sunday to inaugurate a replica of a New York statue of its independence hero Jose Marti.
Just a few years ago, the hundreds gathered for the event overseen by Cuban President Raul Castro would have been in a celebratory mood, but the brief ceremony at daybreak in Havana's colonial district was a sober affair.
With the advent of the Republican administration in Washington, a pall has fallen over the two countries' fragile detente.
U.S. President Donald Trump, whose hometown of New York donated the statue, has imposed new restrictions on travel and trade with the Communist-run island and disparaged what he calls the “terrible and misguided” policy of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, toward Cuba.
Throughout Sunday's event, Castro and other officials sat stone-faced.
""I was hoping for a party, but since I arrived yesterday, we have all been commiserating over the situation,"" said a banker who donated to the $2.5 million project and asked for anonymity.
Since August, tensions between the two countries have deteriorated further over a series of alleged attacks affecting the health of U.S. diplomats in Havana.
The United States has withdrawn a majority of its diplomats from the city and expelled 17 Cubans from their Washington embassy, all but ending consular services and most contact.
After Obama and Castro announced a detente in 2014, the Bronx Museum of the Arts decided to gather donations to make a copy of the sculpture as a gift for Havana.
The equestrian statue depicts Marti moments before his death in a cavalry charge in 1895, during the fight against Spanish colonial rule.
A handful of U.S. politicians and many more businessmen and representatives from the arts and Cuban-American community attended the event, which marked the 165th anniversary of Marti’s birth.
Joseph Mizzi, chairman of the museum’s board of trustees, said the statue symbolized the friendship between the people of both countries.
A letter was read from New York Mayor Bill de Blasio stating his city was proud of its friendship with Cuba.

Marti, a poet and political essayist, was living in New York when he drew up plans for an invasion of Cuba as part of the rebellion against Spain.

Earlier this month, Namazi, who was detained in February 2016 and later convicted of espionage charges that he denied, was taken to the hospital for the fourth time in the past year after a severe drop in his blood pressure, an irregular heartbeat, depletion of energy and his coloring turning white, his lawyer, Jared Genser, said in a statement. 
Namazi had emergency heart surgery in September to install a pacemaker, Genser said, adding that Namazi's doctors had said prison conditions were ""dangerous"" for him and would worsen his health.
""I beg the Iranian authorities to show compassion and grant my father a permanent release so he can spend his remaining time with his family before we face an irreversible tragedy,"" his son Babak Namazi said in a statement. 
In October 2015, the Revolutionary Guards detained Namazi's son Siamak, a businessman in his mid-40s who also has dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, as he was visiting family in Tehran.
Both Babak and Siamak Namazi were sentenced in the autumn of 2016 to 10 years in prison for spying and cooperating with the U.S. government. They denied the charges. 
""We welcome the release of Baquer Namazi given his deteriorating health but we note that his release is only temporary,"" said Heather Nauert, U.S. State Department spokeswoman. She added that the United States urged the full release of Namazi and his son ""as well as other Americans unjustly held by the Iranian government.""
Iran does not recognize dual citizenship and judiciary officials have said both men would be treated as Iranian citizens in the legal process.

547,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",Several high-profile Egyptians call for presidential election boycott,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Several leading opposition figures called on Sunday for a boycott of Egypt's March election, citing a wave of repression that has cleared the field of challengers to President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
A string of candidates have withdrawn from the election on concerns over intimidation and the arrest of Sisi's leading challenger, leaving the former general the sole contender only a day before the Jan. 29 nomination deadline.
Former military commander Sisi was elected in 2014, a year after leading the army to the ousting of Islamist President Mohamed Mursi. The election will be the third since protests in 2011 unseated long-time ruler Hosni Mubarak.
""We call on our great people to boycott these elections entirely, and to not recognize anything that results from it,"" figures from across the political spectrum said in a joint statement.
Signatories included Abdel Moneim Abol Foutoh, an Islamist who garnered nearly a fifth of first round votes in a 2012 presidential race; Hesham Genena, a prominent former anti-corruption watchdog chief; and Mohamed Anwar Sadat, who halted his own presidential bid this month out of concern for the safety of his campaigners.
Representatives from the president's office and the electoral commission were not immediately available for comment on Sunday. The president's office has not commented previously on the election race.
The electoral commission has said that it will ensure the vote is fair and transparent. 
Sunday's statement calling for a boycott said that the state's policies were paving the way for extended limits to presidential terms and are ""removing any opportunity for the peaceful transfer of power"".
In a separate statement Sadat called on party leaders and public figures to join him in a peaceful march to the presidential palace to demand a meeting with Sisi to discuss ""democratic transition"" and a repressive media environment, though he did not specify a date.
The call to boycott comes a day after Genena was attacked and badly wounded outside his home in what his lawyer described as an attempted kidnapping.
Genena had been working to elect former military chief-of-staff Sami Anan, whose campaign had emerged as the most formidable challenge to Sisi before Anan was arrested last week and accused of running for office without military permission.

In separate television interviews, Senators Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham expressed dismay at reports the Republican president had told the top White House lawyer to order U.S. Justice Department officials to fire Mueller.
""I’ve got legislation protecting Mr. Mueller, and I’d be glad to pass it tomorrow,"" Graham told the ABC News ""This Week"" program. 
On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Collins said: ""It certainly wouldn’t hurt to put that extra safeguard in place, given the latest stories."" 
Tensions over Mueller's probe are hovering over Trump's year-old presidency as he prepares to give his first State of the Union Address on Tuesday.
The New York Times reported on Thursday that Trump ordered White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mueller in June but backed down after McGahn threatened to resign rather than carry out the order.
McGahn was ""fed up"" after Trump's order, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. He did not issue an ultimatum directly to the president but told then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and then-chief strategist Steve Bannon that he wanted to quit, the source said.
Graham and three Democratic senators introduced legislation last August that would protect special counsels, including Mueller, by requiring that a panel of federal judges review any action to remove them.
The likelihood that such a bill would become law have seemed remote. Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have shown little enthusiasm for the idea.
""I don't think there's a need for legislation right now to protect Mueller,"" House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program. ""The president and his team have fully cooperated"" with the special counsel, he said.
Republicans hold the majority in both the House and Senate.
Mueller is investigating whether Trump associates and the Kremlin colluded during the 2016 presidential election. Russia denies such collusion, and Trump frequently denounces the probe as a ""witch hunt.""
Both Collins and Graham said they saw no sign that Trump is currently trying to fire Mueller.
""I think what happened here is the president had a bad idea,"" Collins said. ""He talked with his counsel, who explained to an angry and frustrated president why it was a bad idea.""

Graham said: ""It's pretty clear to me everyone in the White House knows it’d be the end of President Trump’s presidency if he tried to fire Mr. Mueller.""

549,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>","Compromise, German SPD's Schulz urges his own party and Merkel","BERLIN (Reuters) - The leader of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) called on party rank-and-file to show readiness to compromise when they vote on the outcome of coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, amid growing nervousness about the ballot.
Leader Martin Schulz promised the party's restive membership a vote to ratify any decision to sign up for four more years of ""grand coalition"" government with the conservatives, tying both his and Merkel's careers to the poll's outcome.
""I have to convince the party's 440,000 members,"" he told ARD television immediately before leaving for Sunday evening talks with his conservative counterparts, adding a warning for Merkel and Horst Seehofer, leader of the Bavarian conservatives.
""We are certainly ready to compromise. But we also expect the conservatives to move,"" he said, in an apparent attempt to leverage the threat of a veto by party membership in order to extract concessions from a reluctant conservative camp.
As he spoke, Merkel and Seehofer were holding one-to-one talks in preparation for Schulz's arrival. The two camps hope to reach a final coalition deal by next Sunday, which would allow a new government to be formed by Easter.
Party members are unhappy with a draft deal reached with the conservatives, especially in the areas of health insurance and family reunification for refugees, where the radical ""Jusos"" youth wing wants Germany to be more generous.
The Jusos are busy recruiting new members to the party in the hope that they will vote down the coalition deal, making way for the SPD to reinvent itself in opposition after scoring disastrous losses in September's national election.
This is adding to pressure on negotiators to reach a deal and end an unprecedented four months' interregnum in Europe's political and economic behemoth.
The party's presidency will decide on Monday on when to set the cut-off date after which new members will not be eligible to participate in the ballot.
In a sign that even the hardest-line conservatives are concerned an SPD membership veto could end up scuppering a deal, a senior Bavarian conservative invited the SPD to make proposals on family reunification, implying there was room for compromise.
""The crucial thing is that the immigration cap of between 180,000 and 220,000 arrivals a year not be exceeded,"" said Joachim Herrmann, Bavaria's interior minister, in an interview with the Passauer Neue Presse. Until now, Bavaria's conservatives have been the strongest opponents of compromise.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - Gunmen killed at least three Malian soldiers in an attack on a military post in the northeast on Sunday, security sources and a local official said, capping a week of violence that has stoked concerns about worsening security in the arid region.
The unknown assailants came before dawn and surrounded the post in the town of Menaka in Mali's remote desert near the border with Niger, killing three soldiers, a security source said. A local official said five were killed after a gunfire exchange that lasted 40 minutes.
An official Malian spokesman was not available to comment. 
The scrubland of West Africa's Sahel region has been the scene of growing militant violence over the past year, some perpetrated by groups with links to Islamic State and al Qaeda who roam the vast desert stretches and cross international borders often without detection. 
The deteriorating situation has drawn a growing international military response including from France and the United States aimed at restoring security in Mali and the wider Sahel that includes Niger, Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Chad. 
French forces pushed back a northern Islamist insurgency in Mali in 2013, but since then attacks have spread further south towards the capital, Bamako, despite the presence of a U.N. peacekeeping mission. 
On Saturday, a group of around 30 heavily armed fighters attacked a military camp in Soumpi, located in the center of the country near the southern boundary of Mali's Timbuktu region.
On Thursday, a landmine blew up a civilian passenger vehicle, again in the country's center, killing 26. The vehicle was passing through an area where militants loyal to Islamic State are known to operate.
Mali and its western neighbor Senegal plan to deploy 1,000 troops soon in an operation to pacify central Mali, but regional experts have raised concerns that military intervention will not solve a crisis in an impoverished rural region whose troubles have complex, local roots.

The latest poll marked a decline from November and December, when 26 percent and 22 percent of Peruvians approved of the business-friendly former Wall Street banker's performance.
In late December, Kuczynski granted the 79-year-old Fujimori a pardon on medical grounds, allowing him to leave prison.
Fujimori had been serving a 25-year sentence for graft and human rights crimes during his 1990-2000 right-wing populist government.
But eight in 10 respondents believe the pardon was part of political deal, and not given for humanitarian reasons, according to the poll of 1,293 respondents conducted by GfK Jan. 22-24 and published in local newspaper La Republica. The margin of error was 2.8 percent.
Reuters reported last week that Kuczynski negotiated Fujimori's release with the ex-leader's son, Kenji, in exchange for political support in Congress, citing sources.
The poll found 50 percent of Peruvians supported the pardon, while 49 percent were opposed. That reflected deep divisions over the legacy of Fujimori.
Some credit him with stabilizing the economy and defeating leftist rebels during his 10-year rule starting in 1990, but others see him as a corrupt dictator. 

Both Kuczynski's and Kenji's representatives have denied that the pardon was politically motivated.

One of the new attacks killed two officers and wounded a third just before midnight in rural Bolivar province, police said in a statement, while the other occurred in Soledad about four hours later, according to a police source.
Six people were wounded by the explosion there, five of them police officers, the police source said.
Dumek Turbay, the governor of Bolivar province, wrote on Twitter that the violence was ""disgusting and vile"".
Authorities have arrested one person in connection to Saturday morning's bombing in the port city of Barranquilla, which officials said could have been retaliation for police raids targeting criminal gangs.
Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the wounded after that explosion and vowed the government would not rest until the perpetrators were caught. 

Colombia has myriad crime gangs, some of which operate across large swaths of rural territory and others in major cities. Many are involved in the production and trafficking of cocaine, largely to the United States and Europe, as well as extortion and other crimes.

Chanoknan Ruamsap said in a post on her Facebook account on Sunday that she received a summons earlier this month to hear a royal insult charge under Article 112 for posting a profile of the king from the BBC's Thai-language service, which some deemed offensive. 
Reuters could not immediately reach the Thai authorities or the BBC for comment.
""It appears that I had been charged with 112 for sharing the BBC article in December 2016,"" Chanoknan said.
""I had less than 30 minutes to decide whether to stay or leave. It was a hard decision because this time I wouldn't be able to come back.""
The BBC article was published shortly after King Maha Vajiralongkorn ascended the throne in December 2016 following the death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died that October aged 88.
Thailand has the world's toughest lese-majeste law, known as Article 112. The law sets a sentence of up to 15 years in prison for each offense of royal insult committed.
Jatupat Boonpattararaksa, an activist who has staged several anti-junta protests, was arrested in 2016 and was sentenced last year to two and a half years in prison for posting the same BBC article.
Prosecutions under both the Computer Crime Act and the royal defamation law have increased sharply since a military junta took power in a 2014 coup. Since the coup, at least 94 people have been prosecuted for lese majeste. As many as 43 people have been sentenced, the iLaw group that monitors royal insult cases said earlier this month.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who heads the junta, has repeatedly vowed to stamp out critics of the monarchy and has also called for stronger prosecution of lese-majeste cases since the coup.
Critics of the junta say the law has been used to silence its opponents while international rights groups and some Bangkok-based Western diplomats have decried Thailand's harsh sentences for lese-majeste convictions.

Mahathir Mohamad, the 92-year-old former premier seen as the most serious challenger to Prime Minister Najib Razak in an election that must be held by August, met the EU ambassadors on Thursday and asked for help to ensure that the vote is conducted fairly, local media reports said, quoting opposition leaders.
The Malaysian foreign minister slammed the meeting in a statement on Sunday, saying that issues raised at the meeting affected the country's dignity and sovereignty.
Anifah Aman said that Malaysia will not stop foreign ambassadors from conducting international diplomacy, in line with the Vienna Convention. But it would take strong action to protect its sovereignty. 
""The government will not hesitate, in defending the rights of the people and the sovereignty and dignity of the country, to take appropriately strong action on any foreign party that contravenes such norms and values as enshrined in the convention,"" Anifah said in a statement.
The EU ambassadors could not be reached immediately for comment while the embassies were closed for the weekend.
Opposition parties have long accused the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which has been in power since Malaysia's independence in 1957, of election rigging and fraud. The accusations have been consistently denied by the government.
Mahathir, who served as Prime Minister for 22 years, has himself been critical of Western intervention in the past and was reported to have stopped opposition leaders from meeting foreign envoys during his rule. 
Anifah said that last week's meeting could also affect Malaysia's efforts to defend the nation's palm oil industry after the EU's decision to back a ban on using palm oil to make biofuels. 
Malaysia is reviewing its trade with the European Union after the ban.
""This (meeting) clearly impacts the government's efforts to defend the country's sovereignty and image, including the government's efforts to defend the nation's palm oil industry,"" Anifah said in the statement.
Mahathir will become the world' oldest prime minister if he defeats Najib and wins the elections this year. But Najib is still widely expected to win the vote, despite being accused of graft and mismanagement.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Cabinet Office minister David Lidington urged his party to unite to heal growing rifts over how to leave the European Union that could threaten the prime minister's fragile grip on the leadership.
After a series of public rows in recent days, Lidington, who works closely with Prime Minister Theresa May, said all sides of the ruling center-right Conservative party should unite to confront Jeremy Corbyn's opposition Labour party.
""What I say to all my colleagues is the Conservative family needs to come together in a spirit of mutual respect and look at what the bigger picture is showing,"" Lidington told the BBC. 
May is struggling to juggle competing demands from within her party on the best route out of the bloc which Britain is scheduled to leave in March 2019.
In comments likely to galvanize supporters of a clean break with the EU, U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the way May is negotiating Brexit. He said he would take a tougher line in the talks in an interview that will be broadcast later on Sunday. [nL8N1PN0AC]
Lidington stepped in after a series of public clashes over Brexit, the latest of which saw the former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers warn that Britain risked remaining in the EU ""in all but name"".
Villiers, a cabinet minister under Prime Minister David Cameron and who campaigned to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum, used an article in the Sunday Telegraph to warn against a deal that could lead to a ""a dilution of Brexit"".
Many Brexit backers are voicing concern that the referendum result may be betrayed with the government agreeing to have a two-year transition period with the EU in which little changes.
Britain's finance minister Philip Hammond enraged members of his party last week for saying the UK's trade relations with the EU would change only ""very modestly"" after Brexit.
May has appeared vulnerable after calling an election last June only to lose her parliamentary majority. She has remained in power in part because her party remains too divided to rally around a potential successor.
Corbyn has also faced criticism from his party to clarify what relationship he wants with the EU amid signs of growing support for a second vote on whether to leave the trading bloc.
On Sunday, Corbyn said he is not calling for a second referendum, but said his party may consider making future payments into the EU budget for access to the single market.

""That's some way down the line whether we need to do that or not,"" he said.

Cairo - solely dependent on the Nile for its water - is at odds with Ethiopia over the construction of the Grand Renaissance Dam, which it fears could reduce waters cascading down from Ethiopian highlands and through the deserts of Sudan to its fields and reservoirs.
Ethiopia says the $4 billion-dam will have no such impact.
""The aim is to agree on the resumption of the consultations,"" said a diplomat attending an African Union summit in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, where the three leaders are gathered. The diplomat was speaking on condition of anonymity. 
An Egyptian government source confirmed that Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi would participate, saying he extended his stay to do so.
Sisi will meet Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir and Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, according to the diplomat.
Discussions have been deadlocked for months over the wording of a study on the dam's environmental impact. In December, Egypt proposed that the World Bank be allowed to help settle the dispute, a call dismissed by Ethiopia. 
Countries that share the Nile river have argued over the use of its waters for decades - and analysts have repeatedly warned that the disputes could eventually boil over into conflict.
A bone of contention for both Ethiopia and Egypt is the speed at which the dam's reservoir would be filled.
The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam - now over 60 percent complete and which will churn out 6,000 MW upon completion - is centerpiece to the country's ambitious power exporting plans.

559,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2018 08:58AM ET</span>",Russian police detain opposition leader Navalny at protest,"By Maria Tsvetkova, Denis Pinchuk and Jack Stubbs
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian police wrestled opposition leader Alexei Navalny into a patrol wagon on Sunday, moments after he appeared at a rally to urge voters to boycott what he said would be a rigged presidential election in March.
Navalny has little chance of influencing the election, likely to be won comfortably by President Vladimir Putin, but his ability to use social media to mobilize crowds of mostly young protesters in major cities has irked the Kremlin.
The numbers who showed up at protests across Russia on Sunday - some shouting ""Putin is a thief"" - were lower than previous demonstrations Navalny had staged, according to estimates from Reuters reporters, indicating the momentum may have shifted away from him. 
Video footage posted on social media showed Navalny appear on Moscow's main thoroughfare, Tverskaya Street, a few hundred meters (yards) from the Kremlin, to join several hundred supporters taking part in the protest, which the authorities had said was illegal.
He had only walked a short distance when he was surrounded by helmet-clad police officers. They grabbed him and forced him to the ground on the pavement, and then dragged him feet first into the patrol wagon, the video footage showed.
Navalny's personal Twitter feed carried a post to his followers saying he had been detained. ""That does not matter. Come to Tverskaya. You're not coming out for me, but for your future,"" the post said.
He was taken to a police precinct in central Moscow, Navalny's Internet site reported. Police said in a statement he would be charged with violating laws on holding demonstrations. The maximum penalty Navalny faces for the offence is 30 days in jail.
PROTEST NUMBERS
Navalny emerged as a threat to the Kremlin's tight grip on power on June 12 last year, when thousands of his followers defied police prohibitions to protest in cities across Russia. The scale of the protests, some of the biggest in six years, took the Kremlin by surprise.
On Sunday, several hundred people gathered in Moscow's central Pushkin square, ignoring police appeals over a loud-hailer for them to disperse. 
Hundreds of people also protested in St. Petersburg, Russia's second-biggest city, in Yekaterinburg in the Ural mountains, and other major centers. 
By 15:00 Moscow time (12:00 GMT), police had detained 180 protesters nationwide, according to OVD-Info, a non-governmental group that tracks the arrests. 
But Navalny, who says he has faced a campaign of harassment from the authorities, has struggled to mobilize the same numbers in the two nationwide protests he has called since the breakthrough protest in June.
In Moscow on Sunday, the protesters who had accompanied Navalny until his detention were at times hard to distinguish from the flow of shoppers and sight-seers on Tverskaya Street.
A Reuters reporter heard two American tourists asking if Putin ""is coming to this parade?"" A few metres (yards) from where Navalny was detained, a tour guide was telling a group of clients about the history of a pre-revolutionary mansion.
DOMINANT LEADER
Putin, 65, has been in power, either as president or prime minister, since 2000, longer than veteran Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and outstripped only by dictator Josef Stalin.
Many voters credit him with restoring stability after the turbulence following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and of restoring Russia's influence abroad through his foreign policy.
The Kremlin says the presidential election will be fair. Officials say Navalny and his supporters have minimal support and are irresponsibly trying to foment social anger which could lead to turmoil.
Putin's opponents though say he is maintaining his grip on power by eroding democracy.
In the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, just under 900 miles (1,450 km) east of Moscow, around 1,000 protesters gathered in temperatures of nearly -10 Celsius (50 Fahrenheit) to back Navalny's boycott call.
""No election? No to elections,"" a placard being held by one young man read. Other protesters waved Russian flags or red and white placards calling for a boycott.
""We don't yet have the right to vote,"" Masha, 16, who declined to give her surname, told Reuters. ""But we need to think about the future and we want to live in a country where there will be honest elections.""
Earlier on Sunday, police forced their way into Navalny's Moscow office using power tools, citing reports of a bomb threat, an online feed run by Navalny's supporters showed.
Police shut down a TV studio at Navalny's office during the same raid which had been broadcasting online news bulletins, but another studio in a different location continued to operate.

The fact Navalny appeared at Sunday's rally was a coup of sorts. The previous time he had tried to attend one of his demonstrations, in June last year, police detained him at his apartment building on the morning of the protest.

ROME (Reuters) - Former prime minister Matteo Renzi triggered uproar in his center-left Democratic Party (PD) at the weekend by packing the group's electoral list with close allies and shutting the door on internal rivals.
The ruling PD is trailing in the opinion polls ahead of a March 4 national election and looks certain to lose power, with Silvio Berlusconi's center-right bloc on course to win most seats, albeit falling short of an absolute majority.
Parties have to present their candidates by Monday and there has been enormous friction in all groups as the deadline nears. However, the PD faced particular turmoil amid accusations that Renzi was taking advantage of the vote to neuter his critics.
Support for the PD has eroded steadily over the past two years, with prolonged budget austerity and Renzi's abrasive leadership style grating with voters in the eurozone's third largest economy.
Renzi resigned as prime minister in 2016 after losing a referendum on constitutional reform and then had to face down an internal leadership battle. Many of his opponents' backers found out on Saturday that they had been excluded from the lists.
""This is a mortal blow to the values of the party,"" said Beppe Lumia, one of a large number of PD parliamentarians barred from re-election. 
""Renzi has settled his scores,"" said Marco Meloni, another PD lawmaker pushed out from his seat.
TOUGH ASSIGNMENT
Renzi faced a tough task. While the PD held almost 300 seats in the outgoing lower house, polls predict it will win between 130-170 this time around, meaning there was a desperate scrabble amongst lawmakers to secure safe spots on the party lists.
""It has been one of the most devastating experiences that I have gone through,"" Renzi said after spending hours hunched over an excel spreadsheet working out his roster of candidates.
Industry Minister Carlo Calenda, who is not a member of any party but is seen as close to Renzi, took to Twitter to question the selection: ""What is the point of not picking serious, well-prepared people who have fought so many important battles,"" he wrote, reeling off a list of lawmakers left out in the cold.
The PD suffered one schism in 2016, with a group of prominent leftists, including former prime minister Massimo D'Alema, walking out and accusing Renzi of pushing the party to the right of the political spectrum.
With a number of centre-right veterans finding safe berths in the PD lists, these accusations resurfaced, and some of Renzi's critics accused him of readying the party for a pact with Berlusconi in the event of a hung parliament.
Renzi, who has ruled out any eventual coalition deal with Berlusconi, urged calm, saying the PD could yet pull off victory, despite ebbing support in the opinion polls.
""Don't underestimate the PD. We are convinced that we have put together the best list for victory,"" he told reporters.

Michel Delpuech, head of the Paris police body, told reporters that around 1,500 people had been moved out of homes in the Ile de France region comprising the French capital and its suburbs.
""The waters will only go away slowly,"" added Delpuech.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump would take a ""tougher"" approach to Brexit negotiations than Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May, he said in a television interview to be broadcast later on Sunday. 
In the interview with British channel  ITV  (LON:ITV), Trump said the European Union was ""not cracked up to what it's supposed to be"" and claimed he had predicted the result of the June 2016 referendum in which Britons voted to leave the EU. Trump was elected to the U.S. presidency later the same year. 
When asked if May was in a ""good position"" regarding the ongoing Brexit talks, Trump replied: ""Would it be the way I negotiate? No, I wouldn't negotiate it the way it's [being] negotiated ... I would have had a different attitude."" 
Pressed on how his approach would be different, he said: ""I would have said the European Union is not cracked up to what it's supposed to be. I would have taken a tougher stand in getting out.""
May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his inauguration in January last year and they were filmed emerging from the White House holding hands. 
But the ""special relationship"" between the two nations has since faced several ups and downs, including Trump rebuking May on Twitter after she criticized him for retweeting British far-right anti-Islam videos.
He said in an earlier extract from the same interview that he had not intended to cause offence in Britain by sharing the videos and that he would apologize if the original posters were horrible racists.
Trump's comments on militant attacks in Britain have angered some and he has often exchanged barbs on social media with London Mayor Sadiq Khan. 
Trump also said in the interview that he had anticipated the Brexit referendum result because of many Britons' concerns over immigration -- also a key plank of his U.S. election campaign. 
""I said [that] because of trade, but mostly immigration, Brexit is going to be a big upset. And I was right,"" he said. ""I know the British people and understand them.""
""They don't want people coming from all over the world into Britain, they don't know anything about these people.""
Trump also said he had been invited by May to make two visits to Britain this year. 
Earlier this month, he canceled a trip to London to open a new embassy, saying he did not want to endorse a bad deal agreed by the Obama administration to sell the old one for ""peanuts"".
Some Britons are angry at the prospect of a visit by Trump, with large protests expected when he does arrive.
Asked in the interview if he had been invited to the wedding of Britain's Prince Harry and his American fiancee Meghan Markle, Trump said: ""Not that I know of.""
He declined to say if he would like to attend the wedding at Windsor Castle but added: ""I want them to be happy. I really want them to be happy. 

""They look like a lovely couple.""

ADEN/MARIB, Yemen (Reuters) - Several people were killed as Yemeni armed groups allied to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates fought in the southern city of Aden on Sunday, local medical staff said, deepening a rift between forces that had been on the same side.
The worst clashes yet between UAE-backed southern separatists and forces loyal to the Saudi-based government risk crippling their once united war effort against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen's north.
An unprecedented military adventure for the usually cautious Gulf states, the campaign in their much poorer and less politically stable neighbor was aimed at sending a decisive signal that they would oppose Iranian expansion in their midst.
But Yemen has been torn apart by three years of conflict and the factional fighting in the south compounds the misery.
Prime Minister Ahmed bin Dagher denounced moves by southern separatists as a coup, saying the situation was moving toward ""a comprehensive military confrontation ... (which is) a direct gift to the Houthis and Iran"".
Gunmen were deployed throughout most districts of Aden on Sunday and there was heavy automatic gunfire and explosions in the southern port city, according to Reuters witnesses.
Armed separatists wrested a key military base and several government buildings from soldiers loyal to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi as residents reported that hundreds of pro-Southern demonstrators had gathered in a main square.
The clashes come as a deadline imposed by the separatists for the government to resign expired on Sunday.
RECREATING SOUTH YEMEN
Although Hadi remains in exile in Saudi Arabia, his administration nominally controls about four-fifths of Yemen's territory, but political and military leaders in Aden now want to revive the former independent state of South Yemen.
The southern separatists - the Southern Resistance Forces - last week accused Hadi's cabinet of corruption and inefficiency and demanded they quit.
A top military adviser to President Hadi, Mohammed Ali al-Miqdashi, said any move toward rebellion would render the southerners an enemy.
""There is no difference between the Houthis and anyone else who rebels against the legitimate government, no matter who they are - left, right, south, east,"" said Miqdashi, speaking at a remote military base near the central Yemeni city of Marib, late on Saturday.
A senior southern political source accused the government of pushing the dispute toward an armed showdown.
""The Hadi government was nervous about any demonstration by the people, so they tried to stop it by force thinking that if there were a battle, the coalition would intervene and save them,"" the source said.
In a statement late on Saturday before the clashes began, the Saudi-led coalition urged all parties to seek ""calm and restraint, adhering to the language of a calm dialogue.""

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said there was intense fighting accompanied by large blasts, heavy shelling and air raids after an attack by jihadist rebels. It said the Syrian army of President Bashar al-Assad had fired dozens of rockets and shells into eastern Ghouta since the ceasefire was reported to have begun.
A military media unit run by Assad's ally Hezbollah said the Syrian army had repulsed an attack by jihadist rebels in eastern Ghouta, detonating an insurgent car bomb. It had then responded to the assault with shelling and air strikes, it said.
A resident of Damascus said bombardment could be heard coming from eastern Ghouta on Sunday morning and smoke was visible.
Late on Friday, a rebel official said that Assad's ally Russia had promised the opposition delegation at peace talks in Vienna that it would put pressure on Damascus to enforce a truce in eastern Ghouta.
The ceasefire was never publicly confirmed by the Syrian government.
International concern has been rising over the fate of 400,000 people living in besieged, rebel-held eastern Ghouta as acute food and medicine shortages have contributed to what the United Nations has called the worst malnutrition of the war.

China and Japan have long sparred over their painful history, with Beijing frequently accusing Tokyo of not properly atoning for Japan's invasion of China before and during the war.
Ties between China and Japan, the world's second- and third-largest economies, have also been plagued by a long-running territorial dispute over a cluster of East China Sea islets and suspicion in China about efforts by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to amend Japan's pacifist constitution.
However the two countries have sought to improve ties, and Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in November on the sidelines of a regional summit in Vietnam.
Wang told Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono that his trip to Beijing, coming so early in the year, showed Japan's strong wish to improve relations, and China approves of this as better ties are in both nation's interests.
However, while there has been positive progress there are also many ""disturbances and obstacles"", Wang said, while also noting comments from Abe on wanting to improve relations.
""China-Japan ties always sail against the current, either forging ahead or drifting backward,"" Wang said, in comments made in front of reporters. 
""We hope that the Japanese side will neither relax in its efforts nor fall back, and turn the spoken statements into concrete actions...""
Kono said that the two countries shared a major responsibility in safeguarding the stability and prosperity of Asia and the world at large. 
""Not only do we need to manage our bilateral relations, but we also need to work together to deal with issues facing the entire globe, in particular the issue of North Korea, which is the matter at hand for international society as a whole. We desire to extend mutual cooperation between our two countries in working toward resolving this issue.""

Japan has repeatedly pressed China to do more to help rein in North Korea's missile and nuclear programs. China says it is committed to enforcing U.N. sanctions, but that all parties need to do more to reduce tensions and restart talks.

Ain Dara is an iron age temple with remains of large carved basalt blocks and wall reliefs. Pictures circulating online, which Reuters could not independently verify, showed an apparent shell crater in the site.
A statement from the Syrian government's antiquities department carried by Syrian state media called for international pressure on Turkey ""to prevent the targeting of archaeological and cultural sites"".
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said Ain Dara was exposed to Turkish shelling, causing significant damage but no casualties.
The Turkish military was not immediately available for comment.
Turkey's operation against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in Afrin began a week ago and has included heavy bombardment but limited advances by its army or allied Syrian rebel groups.
The Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad has condemned the Turkish assault, but it also opposes the YPG and Kurdish aspirations for autonomy in northern parts of Syria.
Syria's civil war which began in 2011, has led to major damage to many historical remains including widespread destruction in the UNESCO World Heritage sites of Palmyra and the Old City of Aleppo.

The right-leaning Saskatchewan Party chose Scott Moe to replace Brad Wall as party leader and the province's premier. Moe is expected to be sworn in as premier in the coming days.
Moe won the race after five rounds of voting, beating out five rivals who sought to replace Wall, who is retiring after serving as premier for a decade.
Saskatchewan is home to some of the world's biggest potash and uranium reserves, which are mined by companies including Nutrien Ltd and Cameco Corp. The provincial government earns royalties from production of its mined resources, as well as of crude oil.
Moe will become premier as the province struggles to end budget deficits caused by steep declines in commodity prices.
Wall has been an outspoken critic of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government and its plans for a carbon-pricing system.
Moe, a former provincial environment minister, has vowed to continue to fight the Liberal government plan, saying it would do nothing to reduce carbon emissions while costing Saskatchewan's economy more than C$2 billion ($1.6 billion).

The Swedish government has said that Gui, who has published books on the personal lives of President Xi Jinping and other Communist Party leaders, was taken into custody last week while traveling with Swedish diplomats to seek medical treatment in Beijing.
The European Union's ambassador to China has called on the Chinese authorities to release Gui immediately, echoing demands from Stockholm.
""We are deeply concerned that Swedish citizen Gui Minhai was detained,"" State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
""We call on Chinese authorities to explain the reasons and legal basis for Mr. Gui's arrest and detention, disclose his whereabouts, and allow him freedom of movement and the freedom to leave China,"" she said.
The United States and European allies would continue to promote ""greater respect for human rights in China,"" she said.
Asked this week about the Swedish and EU demands for Gui's release, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman described the appeals as ""baseless.""
Gui had been abducted in Thailand while on holiday in 2015, one of five Hong Kong booksellers who went missing that year and later appeared in custody on mainland China. The four others have returned to Hong Kong.
Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with a guarantee of wide-ranging freedoms, including freedom of speech, but critics accuse Communist Party rulers in Beijing of creeping interference in the city's affairs.
Chinese authorities said Gui was freed in October after serving a two-year sentence for a traffic-related crime in 2003.
Gui's daughter Angela told Radio Sweden he was taken off a train by plainclothes police while en route to the capital to get medical attention for a neurological ailment.
Sweden's Foreign Ministry has twice summoned China's ambassador to Stockholm to explain the situation.

The ballots will mark the party's electoral debut after thousands of members handed in their weapons under a deal signed with the government of President Juan Manuel Santos in 2016 that ended more than 52 years of war. The group has renamed itself the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force, preserving its FARC initials.
""I am committed to heading up a transitional government which will create the conditions for the birth of a new Colombia,"" said long-time rebel leader and presidential candidate Rodrigo Londono, known by his nom de guerre Timochenko, to cheering supporters in a working-class neighborhood in southern Bogota.
""May the voice of those below, those millions and millions of poor who have never counted, may they be listened to, may they decide their future,"" Londono added.
The group's platform includes free university education, improvements to healthcare paid for by the rich, the construction of roads and electrical lines, and spending on scientific research. 
Hundreds of supporters, many wearing shirts with the party's rose logo, danced to a campaign jingle and waved white flags emblazoned with ""Timo President,"" referring to Londono's nickname.
Besides the May presidential election, the party will field 74 candidates in legislative elections in March, hoping to win more than the 10 seats that it is guaranteed through 2026 under the terms of the peace deal.

Many Colombians remain angry at the FARC, infamous for kidnappings, bombings and displacements, and believe its members should be in prison, not running for congressional seats. Recent opinion polls have shown little support for the party.

JERUSALEM/WARSAW (Reuters) - Israel called on Poland on Saturday to amend a bill approved this week by Polish lawmakers that would make it illegal to suggest Poland bore any responsibility for crimes against humanity committed by Nazi Germany on its soil.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he instructed his ambassador to meet Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki to express opposition to the bill, which would make using phrases like ""Polish death camps"" punishable by up to three years in prison.
""The law is baseless, I strongly oppose it. One cannot change history and the Holocaust cannot be denied,"" Netanyahu said, in comments mirrored by other senior Israeli officials. 
Poland's Deputy Justice Minister Patryk Jaki, who authored the bill, said on Twitter it was not directed against Israel.
""Important Israeli politicians and media are attacking us for the bill ... On top of that they claim that Poles are 'co-responsible' for the Holocaust,"" he said, adding that ""this is proof how necessary this bill is.""
The Polish government said the bill did not aim to limit freedom to research or discuss the Holocaust, or to restrict freedom of artistic activity related to the issue.
Poles have fought for years against the use of phrases like ""Polish death camps"", which suggest the Polish state was at least partly responsible for the camps where millions of people, mostly Jews, were killed by Nazi Germany. The camps were built and operated by the Nazis after they invaded Poland in 1939.
The Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem said it opposed the bill, even though it said Poland was justified in objecting to the term ""Polish death camps"" which it called a misrepresentation.
""Restrictions on statements by scholars and others regarding the Polish people's direct or indirect complicity with the crimes committed on their land during the Holocaust are a serious distortion,"" it said.
The Polish government did not surrender to Nazi Germany and its government did not collaborate with the Nazis.

Polish government spokeswoman Joanna Kopcinska wrote on Twitter that the legislation aimed ""to show the truth about the terrible crimes committed on Poles, Jews, and other nations that were in the 20th century victims of brutal totalitarian regimes - German Nazi regime and Soviet communism.""

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek Cypriots head to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president tasked with breaking a deadlock in unification talks, ending a conflict that harms Greco-Turkish relations and frustrates Ankara's ambitions of joining the European Union.
Sunday's vote is being contested by nine candidates including incumbent conservative Nicos Anastasiades presently leading opinion polls. Barring a major upset, the vote will not produce a clear winner, leading to a runoff on Feb. 4.
Whoever wins will have to find a way to restart peace talks, which collapsed in acrimony in Switzerland in July 2017 over the future role Turkey may play on the island.
Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup, and the EU member state hosts one of the world's longest serving peacekeeping forces with Greek Cypriots in the south, and Turkish Cypriots in the north.
Sunday's vote is likely to be a closely-fought race for second place between Nikolas Papadopoulos, son of the late President Tassos Papadopoulos who led Greek Cypriots into rejecting of a United Nations unification blueprint in 2004, and Stavros Malas, a genetics scientist backed by the left-wing AKEL party.
Papadopoulos takes hard line in negotiations and has accused Anastasiades of making too many concessions. 
It will be the second time in the ring for Malas, who got through to a runoff which Anastasiades eventually won in 2013. He believes peace negotiations should resume as quickly as possible.
""There is going to be a window of opportunity for talks to resume,"" said Spyros Sofos, Research Coordinator at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Lund University in Sweden.
""I think the president who will come out of this election is likely to pursue a peace and reunification process,"" said Sofos, who added however that getting a public on-side for any deal might get tricky in a referendum.

Just over 550,000 Greek Cypriots have the right to vote. Among the candidates is a nationalist who believes Cyprus should be united with Greece. He was once arrested by police for attempting to hurl his fists through the windscreen of a car used by Britain's Queen Elizabeth during a Commonwealth summit in Cyprus in 1993.

Puigdemont, living in Brussels since October, is wanted in Spain on charges of sedition and rebellion for spearheading an independence movement. He is due to face a vote of confidence as the region's only presidential candidate on Jan. 30.
Supporters of Puigdemont have said he could rule the region remotely by video link.
The Constitutional Court - the country's highest legal authority on constitutional matters - said it would make a decision on whether to consider the Spanish government's challenge to Puigdemont's legitimacy as presidential candidate once it has spoken to all parties concerned.
Under Spanish law, once the court officially accepts the government's challenge for consideration, Puigdemont's candidacy will be suspended while the court decides on its legitimacy.
This will be a setback for pro-independence parties, who hold a majority in the Catalan parliament following December elections, and who have put forward Puigdemont as the only candidate to lead the region.
The Spanish government challenged his appointment as sole presidential candidate in the Constitutional Court on Friday, saying that a fugitive from justice could not become the head of the regional administration.

However, Puigdemont's party, Junts per Catalunya (""Together for Catalonia"") said on Saturday there was no basis under Spanish law for him to be barred from standing as president.

The decision to free him, and the release of several other well-known tycoons on Friday, suggested the main part of the corruption probe was winding down after it sent shockwaves through Saudi Arabia's business and political establishment.
In his first interview since being detained, conducted hours before his release, Prince Alwaleed told Reuters he maintained his innocence of any corruption in talks with the authorities.
He said he expected to keep full control of his global investment firm  Kingdom  Holding Co (SE:4280) without being required to hand assets to the state. He said he had been able to communicate with executives at his business while detained.
Prince Alwaleed, who is in his early 60s, described his confinement as a ""misunderstanding"" and said he supported reform efforts by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
""There are no charges. There are just some discussions between me and the government,"" he said.
Prince Alwaleed had been confined at the Ritz-Carlton since early November, along with dozens of other senior officials and businessmen, part of the crown prince's plan to reform oil superpower Saudi Arabia and consolidate his position.
FOREIGN INVESTOR CONCERNS
When asked if the attorney general was convinced of Prince Alwaleed's innocence, the senior Saudi official said:
""I will not negate or confirm what he says. Generally this falls back to those who concluded the settlement, and for sure there is no settlement unless there are violations, and they are not concluded without the accused admitting it in writing and promising not to repeat it.""
The source declined to give further details, but confirmed that Prince Alwaleed would remain head of Kingdom Holding.
A Gulf banker who deals with Saudi Arabia said the authorities appeared keen to conclude the probe partly because foreign investors were concerned their assets or local business partners could be targeted in the wide-ranging crackdown.
Prince Alwaleed's detention was particularly worrying for foreigners because of his international prominence as an investor in top Western companies such as Twitter (N:TWTR) and  Citigroup  (N:C), and in top hotels including the George V in Paris and the Plaza in New York, the banker said.
""The government is signaling that it wants to move to a new phase now, away from the crackdown and into other economic reforms,"" the banker said. 
Outside Prince Alwaleed's Riyadh palace, dozens of cars lined the entrances as a huge Saudi flag flapped above. Guards cracked jokes and drank coffee. His office said the prince was out visiting family, but declined to give any details.
The attorney general said earlier this week that 90 detainees had been released after their were charges dropped, while others traded cash, real estate and other assets for their freedom. The authorities were still holding 95 people, he said. Some are expected to be put on trial.
""NOTHING TO HIDE""
An official Saudi source said on Friday that several prominent businessmen had reached financial settlements with the authorities, including Waleed al-Ibrahim, owner of regional television network MBC, who was released. Terms of his settlement were not revealed.
Saudi authorities have said they expect to raise some $100 billion for the government through such settlements - a huge windfall for the state, which has seen its finances squeezed by low oil prices. Some private analysts think that target will be hard to hit, given how many suspects have seen charges dropped.
Allegations against Prince Alwaleed included money laundering, bribery and extorting officials, a Saudi official told Reuters in November. The prince's net worth has been estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion.
While declaring his innocence in the Reuters interview, the prince appeared greyer and thinner than in his last public appearance, a television interview in October, and had grown a beard while in detention. 
""I have nothing to hide at all. I'm so comfortable, I'm so relaxed. I shave here, like at home. My barber comes here. I'm like at home, frankly speaking,"" he said, adding he had been able to communicate with family members while in detention. 
He granted the 30-minute interview to Reuters, including a tour of his suite, partly to disprove rumors about mistreatment and that he had been moved from the hotel to a prison. 
Prince Alwaleed showed off the comforts of his gold-accented private office, dining room and kitchen, which was fully stocked with his preferred vegetarian meals. 
In the corner of his office sat tennis shoes, which he said he used regularly for exercise. A television played business news programs, and a mug with an image of his own face on it was perched on the desk.
After being released, Prince Alwaleed said, he would stay in Saudi Arabia and would return to the challenge of juggling his global business interests. 

""I will not leave Saudi Arabia, for sure. This is my country.""

No details about the nationalities of those rescued were given, nor was there further information about the deaths.
The migrants were picked up from two barges, two rubber dinghies and one small boat in five separate rescue operations.
During one of the rescues, two helicopters from the Italian navy were used to pick-up seven children with water in their lungs and transport them to the nearest hospital in Tunisia where they were given the necessary care, the coast guard added. 
Immigration is a key issue ahead of a national election in Italy on March 4. The ruling Democratic Party has pointed to a sharp fall in arrivals from Libya since July as proof that it is now managing what before seemed like an endless flow of migrant boats.
Arrivals fell by a third last year to 119,000 compared with a year earlier, and they tumbled by two thirds in the second half of the year. The declines came after a deal with the Tripoli government sealed in February, which foresaw aid and training for the Libyans to fight people smuggling and to bolster their coastguard. 
More than 20,000 are estimated to have died attempting the crossing to Italy in the past four years, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates, making it the deadliest border for migrants in the world.
As of Jan. 25, 4,742 people had reached Europe by sea so far this year, the IOM said.

Yuri Dmitriev, 61, is on trial in northwest Russia on charges brought by state prosecutors of involving his adopted daughter, then 11, in child pornography, of illegally possessing ""the main elements of"" a firearm, and of depravity involving a minor. 
The Memorial human rights group, for which he works, said, citing Novaya Gazeta, that Dmitriev arrived at home on Saturday morning.
He denies the charges, saying he took the pictures of the daughter were made for a diary to present the evidence of he improved state of health for the state child care organizations.
Some of Russia's leading cultural figures say Dmitriev was framed because his focus on Stalin's crimes - he found a mass grave with up to 9,000 bodies dating from the Soviet dictator's Great Terror in the 1930s - jars with the latter-day Kremlin narrative that Russia must not be ashamed of its past.
The narrative has taken on added importance ahead of a March presidential election which polls show incumbent Vladimir Putin, who uses his country's World War Two victory when Stalin was in charge to bolster national pride, is on track to win.

Earlier this week, the government barred a satirical film 'The Death of Stalin' from Russian movie theaters, deeming it inappropriate to release the film on the eve of the 75th anniversary of the World War Two Battle of Stalingrad.

Five bodies were found in Benghazi's Laithi neighborhood on Friday, residents told Reuters. Pictures posted on social media appeared to show the bodies, bloodied and mutilated, lying in the dirt.
The pictures could not be independently verified, and security officials in Benghazi declined to comment.
In Derna, 250 kilometers (155 miles) east of Benghazi, the bodies of three people who appeared to have been summarily killed were found dumped in the city on Thursday, medical sources said. 
""UNSMIL is appalled by new reports of retribution killings in Libya,"" the U.N.'s Libya mission, UNSMIL, said on its Twitter account.
""The brutal pattern of violence must end. Those in effective control of fighters and those ordering, committing such crimes are liable under international law.""
The reports came after a twin car bombing in Benghazi left 35 people dead and dozens injured on Tuesday, and on Wednesday pictures and video emerged purporting to show the summary execution of 10 prisoners outside the mosque where the bombing took place.
Benghazi is controlled by the Libyan National Army (LNA), the dominant force in eastern Libya. It is led by Khalifa Haftar and fought Islamists and other opponents in Benghazi from 2014 until late last year as part of a wider conflict that developed in Libya after a 2011 uprising. 
Notes had been left with the bodies found in Benghazi accusing the victims of militant Islamist loyalties, said residents, who did not want to be named for security reasons. 
There have been a number of cases of bodies with gunshot wounds and showing signs of abuse found in Benghazi in areas under LNA control.
In Derna, the LNA has long been battling the Derna Mujahideen Shura Council (DMSC), an armed alliance that controls the city.
The DMSC said it had arrested three people earlier this week for allegedly plotting attacks on behalf of the LNA. A Derna resident said the three were the same men whose bodies were found on Thursday. 
The DMSC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Elite Polish climbers were on Saturday ascending Pakistan's treacherous ""Killer Mountain"" in the dark to save a French woman mountaineer and a fellow Pole, officials said, hoping the daring effort could see them reach the French climber on Sunday.
Military helicopters buzzing over the 8,126 meter (26,660 feet) Nanga Parbat mountain spotted Elisabeth Revol of France at about 6,700m mark during daylight hours, a Pakistani official said, but were unable to communicate with Tomasz Mackiewicz from Poland, who is believed to be in a crevasse.
After abandoning their ascent at about 7,400m on Pakistan's second highest mountain, Revol on Friday helped Mackiewicz, who is suffering from frostbite and snow blindness, come down to 7,280 meters and set him up in a tent to spend the night, before descending and calling for help on a satellite phone.
The race against time effort will continue into the night after Pakistan's military picked up several Polish climbers attempting the first winter ascent of nearby K2, the world's second-highest mountain, and flew them to Nanga Parbat on Saturday to lead the rescue.
Brig. Shahid Sardar, a representative of military-owned Askari Aviation, told Reuters that Revol was spotted near Nanga Parbat's Base Camp 2, while the Polish rescue team had been dropped off at Base Camp 1. 
""We are hoping they will reach the French lady by tomorrow, but there is no contact with the Polish climber. It is a very complex rescue operation,"" Sardar said.
""We should know by mid-day tomorrow.""
Masha Gordon, who is coordinating a crowdfunding campaign to finance the helicopter rescue, said Polish climbers - including elite mountaineers Adam Bielicki and Denis Urubko - were dropped off at Base Camp 1 at 4,800m and had begun their ascent.
""They have a tracker on them and have last been seen at 5,225m. They will continue climbing up through the night,"" Gordon posted on the GoFundMe rescue page, which showed 74,000 euros ($92,000) had been raised by Saturday.
The campaign is aiming to raise 100,000 euros, while the Polish government said it would provide financial guarantees and support for the operation.
Revol knows Mackiewicz's location high up on Nanga Parbat, where in winter perceived temperatures can reach minus 60 degrees Celsius.
""Elisabeth took a decision to start a descent down from 6,700m toward them provided she can find fixed ropes,"" Gordon added. ""She has no battery power left. We believe in the strength of her spirit.""
Pakistan's military said two Pakistan Army helicopters carrying four rescuers were undertaking the mission.
Pakistan rivals Nepal for the number of peaks over 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) and is considered climbers' paradise, but fatalities are also common.
Nanga Parbat obtained its ""Killer Mountain"" moniker due to the high number of lives it has claimed over the years. In June a Spanish man and an Argentinian perished in an avalanche while trying to scale its peak.
The first successful winter ascent of the mountain was made as recently as February 2016. Mackiewicz has made six previous attempts to scale Nanga Parbat in winter.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez called for unity on Saturday after a bitterly disputed election last year as he was sworn in for a second term, even as police skirmished with protesters in the streets.
Hernandez, a conservative supported by the United States, appeared set to lose the Nov. 26 election until an abrupt halt in the vote count and a shift in the results took victory away from his center-left rival, Salvador Nasralla.
Allegations of fraud sparked deadly protests that killed more than 30 people in the impoverished Central American country, which has been plagued by battles between security forces, local gangs and drug traffickers.
As Hernandez spoke at a stadium at his swearing-in, supporters and troops chanted ""unity"" and waved the blue and white Honduran flag.
""If a house is divided against itself, it cannot stand,"" he said, quoting the New Testament. ""I promise to carry out a process of reconciliation among all Hondurans.""
On Saturday, thousands of demonstrators clashed with troops and police, who fired tear gas to disperse the crowd that had gathered a couple of miles from the stadium where Hernandez took office.
Nasralla, a sportscaster and game show host, and his ally Manuel Zelaya, a former leftist president who was overthrown in a 2009 coup, led demonstrators on Saturday.
Antonio Tejada, a 33-year-old laborer at the protests, said Hernandez ""had stolen the presidency against the will of the people."" 
""We will keep fighting until he is out of power,"" he said.
International observers said last year's election was marred by irregularities and the Organization of American States called for a new vote. 
But the result was eventually ratified by the country's electoral tribunal and both Mexico and the United States backed the incumbent.
Following a contentious decision by the Supreme Court in 2015, Hernandez is the first president to be re-elected since the end of military rule nearly four decades ago.
Hernandez has pledged to maintain a hard-line strategy in his fight against the country's gangs, which has helped curb the murder rate, despite human rights groups' allegations of abuses. 
He was applauded by investors in his first term for cutting the deficit and boosting economic growth and he pledged to bring peace to Honduras and promote prosperity on Saturday.

About 60 percent of Hondurans are mired in poverty while much of the country is terrorized by gang violence, driving tens of thousands of people a year to flee for the United States.

At least another six people were injured and are hospitalized in Fortaleza, said Andre Costa, who heads the Ceara state security secretariat, which oversees police forces. 
Costa told journalists that a motive was not yet known, but authorities were investigating whether the killings were part of an ongoing fight between two drug gangs. 
No suspects are in custody.
Eyewitnesses told the Globo TV network that three cars full of armed men arrived at the dance club around 12:30 a.m. and fired rounds into the front of the building for at least a half-hour before fleeing.

HANOVER, Germany (Reuters) - Germany's Greens broke with their broad-church tradition on Saturday by electing as leaders two figures from the centrist wing, a move that would make them more palatable as coalition partners for Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives.
A move to the center could heighten pressure on the Social Democrats (SPD), who are attempting to use their leverage as the conservatives' last remaining possible coalition partner to put a left-wing stamp on a future government.
Long among Europe's most successful environmentalist parties, the Greens have moved from radical origins to become a major center-left force, governing in coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD) for seven years to 2005.
But talks last year on forming a Merkel-led three-way coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) broke down, with complaints that some of the Greens' environmentalist demands were too costly. 
The party, which elects a male and a female co-leader, has traditionally split the two posts between a centrist candidate and a more radical figure from the ""Fundi"" wing.
But at a congress in the northern city of Hanover, delegates elected Robert Habeck and Annalena Baerbock, both from the party's ""Realo"" wing, a move that could create fiercer competition for the beleaguered SPD.
""If we see the supposed contradiction between radicalism and statesmanship as an opportunity and not as a weakness then today really is just the start,"" said Baerbock, adding that she wanted to end dirty coal generation while addressing social dislocation in mining regions.
The SPD, which scored its worst result since 1933 in September's national election, is trying to win back disillusioned voters by securing worker-friendly spending commitments from the conservatives, with whom they are in talks on forming a coalition.
With the collapse of talks on forming a ""Jamaica"" coalition - named because the three parties' colors match the island nation's flag - a renewed SPD alliance became Merkel's best chance of securing a fourth term.
But a more centrist Green party could open space for renewed talks on a Jamaica coalition if current coalition talks fail.
One of two ""people's parties"" that dominated Germany's post-war history, the SPD polled just 19 percent on the eve of coalition talks with the conservatives, placing it only eight points ahead of the Greens.

ANKARA/BEIRUT (Reuters) - The United States has pledged to stop supplying weapons to a Kurdish militia in Syria, Turkey said on Saturday, calling on Washington to immediately remove its troops from a Syrian town of Manbij that Turkish forces plan to target.
Turkey's air and ground offensive in northwest Syria's Afrin region against the Kurdish YPG militia has opened a new front in the seven-year, multi-sided Syrian civil war and strained ties with NATO ally Washington.
Ankara views the YPG as terrorists and as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and has been infuriated by U.S. support, including arms and training, for the militia. The Kurdish fighters have played a prominent role in U.S.-led efforts to combat the hardline Islamic State in Syria.
Since the start of the eight-day-old incursion, dubbed ""Operation Olive Branch"" by Ankara, President Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkish forces would push east towards the town of Manbij, potentially putting them in confrontation with U.S. troops deployed there.
U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster told Erdogan's spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, in a telephone call that the United States would no longer provide weapons to the YPG, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday.
""It was emphasised that Turkey's legitimate security concerns must be paid attention to. It was agreed that close coordination would be carried out in order to avoid misunderstandings,"" it said.
The agreement is likely to be seen by Ankara as a substantial diplomatic victory from the incursion, where Turkish troops and their Syrian rebel allies appear to have made modest advances, as heavy rain and poor weather have hampered air strikes and progress on the ground.
Turkey's foreign minister said the United States needed to follow up its promise with concrete action, including the immediate withdrawal of its troops from the vicinity of Manbij.
""The United States needs to break its link with (the) terrorist organisation and make them drop their weapons completely. They need to collect the weapons they gave, they need to withdraw from Manbij immediately,"" Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters on Saturday.
The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment about ending arms to the YPG or exiting Manbij. 
ERDOGAN LOOKS EAST
Erdogan said this week that Turkish forces would sweep Kurdish fighters from the length of Syrian border and could push all the way east to the frontier with Iraq, a move that would risk a possible confrontation with U.S. forces allied to the Kurds.
Any drive by Turkish forces toward Manbij, part of Kurdish-held territory some 100 km (60 miles) east of Afrin, could also threaten U.S. efforts to stabilize northern Syria. The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, officially as part of the international coalition against Islamic State.
U.S. forces were deployed in and around Manbij to deter Turkish and U.S.-backed rebels from attacking each other and have also carried out training missions in the area.
A senior official for the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Syrian fighters spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG, said any wider Turkish assault would face an ""appropriate response"".
Redur Xelil also said in an interview that he was sure the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, which has backed the SDF in its battle against the jihadists, was trying to put pressure on Turkey to limit its offensive.
DEATH TOLL
Turkey and its Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel allies have killed a total of 394 militants since the incursion began, Erdogan said on Saturday. Turkey and the FSA rebel factions have together lost 20 people he said, without giving a breakdown.
The SDF has accused Turkey of exaggerating the number of Kurdish fighters it had killed.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitoring group, said that 36 civilians in Afrin, including 10 children, have died so far.

A total of 59 YPG fighters and at least 69 fighters from the Turkey-backed FSA have died in clashed, the Observatory said. Seven Turkish soldiers have been killed and another seven are missing, it said.

WARSAW (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Saturday that working groups on fixing what the U.S. sees as flaws in the Iranian nuclear deal have already begun to meet, trying to determine the scope of what is needed and how much Iran needs to be engaged in it.
Tillerson, ending a week-long European trip in Warsaw, said that he had secured support from Britain, France and Germany - all parties to the 2015 agreement - to work on the deal that President Donald Trump has warned he will walk away from unless changes are made. 
""It's always darkest before the dawn,"" Tillerson told journalists. ""The working groups have already begun to meet on efforts to agree principles, what is the scope of what we attempt to address and also how much we engage Iran on discussions to address these issues,"" he said.
The nuclear deal gave Iran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in return for curbs on its atomic program.
Trump vowed to stop waiving U.S. sanctions unless the Europeans agreed to strengthen the deal's terms by consenting to a side agreement that would effectively eliminate provisions that allow Iran to gradually resume some advanced atomic work. Trump also wants tighter restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile program.
Iran has rejected any renegotiation. 
Tillerson said the nuclear deal was only a ""small"" part of U.S. policy in the Middle East and Washington was more immediately concerned about other issues including Iran's support for the Houthi rebels in Yemen and its supplying weapons to militias in the region.
""Our work group also is intending to identify areas of greater cooperation (with) Europe to push back on Iran's malign behaviour,"" he said.
RUSSIA BLAMED 
Despite statements from Russia earlier this week that Washington's accusations against Moscow that it and the Syrian army were behind a chemical attack in eastern Ghouta were ""unfounded"", Tillerson reiterated that ultimately Russia bore responsibility.
""I stand by my comments,"" he said.
""The chemical weapons ... are being used to hit the civilian population, the most vulnerable - children inside of Syria ... We are holding Russia responsible for addressing this. They are (Bashar al-) Assad's ally.""
Russia is providing direct military support in Syria against various rebel groups trying to oust Assad, and giving diplomatic cover in the U.N. Security Council.

The Moscow-brokered meeting aimed at ending Syria's war is due to take place next week. It was postponed last November due to differences between the would-be attendees, including over participation of the Kurds, a sticking point for Turkey.
RIA news agency cited a draft communique of the congress, saying it would call for Syria to remain a united country and for a vote on the future of the country.
""The Syrian people independently determine the future of its country democratically by way of the vote,"" the agency quoted the document as saying.
Nine rounds of U.N. peace talks between the warring sides have made little progress toward ending the civil war in which hundreds of thousands have been killed and 11 million - a majority of the Syrian population - driven from their homes.

Early investigations indicated that Iraqi forces had called in an air strike against a local police force in the town of al-Baghdadi, 170 km (106 miles) north-west of Baghdad, assuming that they were militants, military and security officials said.
The local police group hit by the strike had come to the area without coordinating with an Iraqi army detachment that had been sent there to arrest an Islamic State suspect, an Iraqi military spokesman said in a statement. 
The strike was called in after the army detachment arrested the suspect and withdrew from the area, he added. 
A spokesman of the U.S.-led international coalition said all its air strikes are carried out at the request of the Iraqi security forces.
""Any and all support comes at request/approval of Iraq; NO unilateral coalition operations in Iraq,"" said the spokesman, U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, in a tweet.

The anti-immigrant Freedom Party (FPO), junior coalition government partner to Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservatives, was founded by former Nazis and has repeatedly excluded members in Nazi scandals. It says it has left its Nazi past behind.
""It's not just a case of whitewashing ... but a ridicule of mass murder during the Holocaust, especially the ridicule of the gassing of millions of Jews in Auschwitz,"" Van der Bellen said on the TV program Mittagsjournal on Austrian broadcaster Oe1.
""I mean, where are we? To just accept that without any commentary, and saying the courts must decide over the matter, that's not my position.""
Landbauer, the FPO's top candidate in Lower Austria, which holds a provincial election this weekend, was deputy leader of a fraternity which came under close attention this week when it emerged that it produced a songbook in 1997 that included references to killing Jews.
Landbauer suspended his membership of the fraternity after the scandal erupted and denied any knowledge of such songs.
He said the judiciary had to deal with the case, but added that the book in question had been produced when he was 11 years old, meaning he could not be held responsible for it.
Prosecutors have opened an investigation against persons unknown.
PEACEFUL PROTEST
On Friday, thousands of Austrians marched peacefully in protest against an annual Viennese ball held by the Freedom Party, continuing a wave of demonstrations since its return to government last month.
The Academics' Ball in the former imperial palace in central Vienna draws protests every year. But while previous years' demonstrations have mainly comprised members of anti-fascist and left-wing groups, Friday's protest drew a larger and more varied crowd. 
Police put the number of people taking part in the march at 8,000 while organizers said the turnout was 10,000.
Several FPO ministers had said they would not attend the ball, which included many members of far-right fraternities to which several senior party figures also belong.
However, the head of the FPO, Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache, did attend, with his wife.

""Bahrain is now clearly sliding in a new and very dangerous direction with 37 people arrested yesterday alone,"" said Brian Dooley of U.S.-based Human Rights First. 
""The fairly weak level of restraint that was there before has all but gone,"" he said, adding that countries influential in Bahrain such as the United States and Britain needed to step up their criticism.
Bahrain, where the Shi'ite Muslim majority is ruled by a Sunni Muslim royal family, has pursued a crackdown on opposition activists since quashing 2011 protests calling for democracy.
Authorities have closed opposition political groupings, revoked dissidents' passports and arrested suspected militants. Activists say many arrests are for political reasons and breach detainees' human rights. 
Bahrain, where the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet is based, denies clamping down on dissent. It says it faces a militant threat backed by arch-foe Iran on the opposite side of the Gulf.
The Bahraini Embassy in Britain, responding to a request for comment, cited an earlier statement which said that the Gulf state was committed ""to transparency and the protection and safeguarding of Human Rights enshrined in the Constitution, as well as in international treaties and obligations"".
Human rights activists, at a news conference in Lebanon on Thursday, said the situation has taken a turn for the worse with 19 people now sitting on death row, renewed reports of torture in detention and military courts now trying civilians. 
In January 2017 Bahrain executed three Shi'ite men convicted of killing three policemen in a 2014 bomb attack. They were the first such executions in over two decades, and sparked protests.
Bahrain is due to hold parliamentary elections in 2018. 
The activists also said they have concerning new information about the health of detained prominent rights campaigner Nabeel Rajab, and demand he be given access to adequate healthcare. 
""Recently alarming signals have multiplied ... regarding his detention condition,"" said Dimitris Christopoulos, president of human rights organization FIDH, calling for his release. Rajab is FIDH's deputy secretary general. 
Rajab, a leading figure in the 2011 pro-democracy protests, has been in and out of detention since that time. He faces up to 15 years in jail over Twitter statements he made about the war in Yemen. A verdict is expected on Feb. 21. 
""Nabeel is in real danger,"" said Sheikh Maytham Al-Salman from the Bahrain Center for Human Rights.
Bahraini authorities said Rajab had received medical checks twice in December and January and his health was ""stable"".
""We take very seriously the safety and wellbeing, including healthcare both in terms of access and adequacy, of any person, whether in prison or in detention,"" the director general of the prisons authority said in a statement.

A team of 21 Islamic State fighters crossed Iran's western border and were placed under surveillance before the Guards, the most powerful military force in the Islamic Republic, attacked them on Saturday morning, Sepah News reported.
Most of the militants have been arrested, the report said, but there was no mention of the number of people killed or wounded in the clash.
Last June, Islamic State attacked the Iranian parliament in Tehran and the mausoleum of the Islamic Republic’s founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, killing at least 18 and wounding dozens.
The attackers were all Iranian Kurds from the Kurdish region of western Iran near the Iraqi border.
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards fired several missiles at Islamic State bases in Syria on June 18 in response to that attack.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha had said a general election would take place in November 2018. The date has been postponed several times since the military took power in a 2014 coup. 
The protest on Saturday was a reaction to a decision by Thai lawmakers this week to change an election law, which meant the vote would be pushed back possibly until January or February next year. 
Critics and analysts have said the move could be a ploy by the ruling junta to hold on to power.
""We are gathering here today to demand that the election take place this year, in November, like General Prayuth Chan-ocha has promised,"" prominent activist Rangsiman Rome told a crowd of protesters chanting that they wanted to go to the polls. 
Rangsiman and Sirawith Seritiwat, another activist leader, also threatened that there will be protests next month. 
""On February 10, unless the junta says elections will take place in November this year, we will meet at Democracy Monument,"" Sirawith said. 
The gathering ended after almost two hours without violence.

LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - Residents around an erupting volcano in central Philippines have should prepare to flee to safer areas because of risks from huge debris that could be swept from slopes by heavy rains, state volcanologists said on Saturday.
The most active volcano in the poor Southeast Asian country has been spewing lava and ash for the last two weeks and may have a major eruption within days, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said.
The provincial government has expanded its danger zone to a 9 km (5.6 miles) radius of Mount Mayon in Albay province from the 8 km radius set by volcanologists.
More than 75,000 people had been moved out from the danger zone to sheltered areas but many farmers and quarry workers were defying evacuation orders to work in stone quarries, on farms, and to tend livestock.
""It's a real threat so we are urging everyone to prepare and evacuate when told by authorities,"" said Mariton Bornas, head of the volcanology agency's monitoring and eruption prediction, adding there are fresh lahar (mudflow) deposits in the 2,462 meter (8,977 feet) Mayon's slopes.
""It's really a dangerous combination for the communities. Lahar from Mayon can carry huge boulder and it can bury communities, wash away people and everything in its path, but also because of impact.""
She said boulders as huge as cars and houses could roll down Mayon’s slopes swiftly in minutes.
Heavy rains poured in central Philippines, flooding shelter areas and raising risks of lahar flows.
In Salvacion village, many farmers were sneaking inside the danger zone to plant and look after farm animals saying they need to earn a living.
""I don't think the volcano will erupt,” Istong Jayvee told Reuters. “It already let out fire. It will quiet down soon.""
Farm worker Edna Medina said they are ready anytime to flee when the volcano erupts.
""When the volcano does erupt, we'll get out of here using our motorcycle then head straight for the main road out,” she added.
Volcanologists have raised Mayon’s alert to level 4, one notch below the highest level.

ADEN (Reuters) - Yemen's internationally-recognized government said on Saturday it had banned public gatherings in Aden ahead of a deadline given by southern separatists to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to dismiss the cabinet.
The Southern Transitional Council, comprising senior political figures allied to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), announced last Sunday it planned to oust the government of Ahmed bin Daghr over allegations of corruption and mismanagement if Hadi did not dismiss it within a week.
The new crisis could jeopardize a rare opportunity offered by the death of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh last month that had given a Saudi-led coalition the chance to isolate Iran-aligned Houthi fighters and end a devastating war that began in 2015.
In a statement carried by the state-run Saba news agency, the Yemeni Interior Ministry said it had ""decided to ban any gatherings, sit-ins or marches in the interim capital, Aden.
""These actions will be considered acts that target stability and calm,"" the statement said, adding that all armed groups will also be banned from entering Aden.
GATHERING EXPECTED ON SUNDAY
Residents said they had not seen any extra security in Aden, where armed forces loyal to Hadi's government, the Southern Transitional Council and the Saudi-led coalition are all present.
But witnesses said government forces were deployed on roads leading to the presidential palace in the Maasheeq area, where the government is based.
Witnesses also said that thousands of people had arrived in Aden from across the former South Yemen, which merged with North Yemen in 1990, to participate in a gathering expected to be held on Sunday.
Yemen has been torn by armed conflict since the Houthis captured the capital Sanaa in 2014 before they marched south towards Aden the following year in a military campaign that culminated with Hadi fleeing into exile.
The Saudi-led coalition that entered the war after Hadi sought refuge in Saudi Arabia in March 2015 has helped local fighters free Aden from Houthi control and made other military gains in different parts of the country. But the Houthis continue to control most of northern Yemen, including Sanaa.
The Southern Transitional Council was formed last year to push for a split between the former South Yemen and North Yemen.

Southern forces have previously clashed with Hadi supporters, including members of the Islamist Islah party, over control of strategic areas, such as Aden airport and oil facilities.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras failed to get backing from the main opposition leader on Saturday to build consensus ahead of intensified talks between Greece and Macedonia on resolving a decades-old name row.
Athens and Skopje have agreed to step up negotiations to reach an accord in a dispute which has stymied the ambitions of the tiny but strategically-placed ex-Yugloslav republic in joining NATO and the European Union.
Greece believes the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim over its own northern region of that name. Hundreds of thousands of Greeks rallied in the northern city of Thessaloniki earlier this month to protest against the use of the name ""Macedonia"" in any solution to the row.
There have been some suggestions there could be a two-name 
solution such as Northern Macedonia or Macedonia-Skopje. 
""We will not divide Greeks to unite Skopje,"" Conservative New Democracy party leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a televised address after a meeting with Tsipras.
He said resolving the name dispute was not just a foreign policy matter but a serious issue relating to Greece's history and ""the very identity of Greeks"".
As a member of both, Greece's assent is needed for its neighbor to join NATO and the EU, but the name ""Macedonia"" is perceived to denote irredentist ambitions against its own northern province of Macedonia.
It is an issue that sometimes mystifies foreigners, but which is deeply felt among many Greeks.
Mitsotakis, whose party is leading in opinion polls, blamed Tsipras for not asking for constitutional changes in Skopje as a ""necessary precondition"" for any talks, noting that the window of opportunity for a deal has closed. 
A United Nations envoy, Matthew Nimetz, is due in both countries next week to further discussions.
Talks between the two states have been inconclusive since 1991, when Macedonia withdrew from former Yugoslavia. It was admitted into the United Nations in 1993 under the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, sometimes referred to as FYROM.
Talks are taking place against a backdrop of mounting public sentiment in Greece against any deal which could include the name Macedonia. The large turnout at the Thessaloniki rally on Jan. 21 was unexpected, and another demonstration is scheduled in Athens on Feb. 4.

On Friday, Greece's influential Orthodox Church entered the fray, saying it was against any accord with the neighboring country including the name Macedonia.

The government and the United Nations said last month that South Sudan needs $1.7 billion in aid this year to help 6 million people - half its population - cope with the effects of war, hunger and economic decline. 
Paul Dhel, deputy chairperson of the South Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, attributed the decision to waive the $3,500 fee for international NGOs, and $500 for local organizations, to the urgent humanitarian situation facing the country.
""The registration is completely for free. This one is going to boost humanitarian work in the country,"" he told Reuters, saying the waiver would run for a year.
South Sudan has been criticized in the past for imposing massive charges on aid groups and their workers to register them to operate in the country.
The U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, pressed President Salva Kiir at a meeting in Juba last year to facilitate the work of humanitarian groups, securing an order from the president to his troops to provide unfettered access to humanitarian convoys.
Haley welcomed the waiver, saying the fees charged for work permits for foreign aid workers should also be reviewed.

""Work permit fees – often ranging between $2,000 to $4,000 per international staff member – remain a much greater financial burden,"" she said in a statement.

Hisham Genena, a former anti-corruption watchdog chief, was working to elect former military chief-of-staff Lieutenant General Sami Anan, the last challenger seen as a potential threat to the re-election of Sisi in elections slated for March. 
Anan's campaign was abruptly shuttered after he was arrested this week and accused of running for office without military permission.
Genena had just left his home in a suburb outside Cairo when two cars stopped him and a group of men attacked him with knives and sticks, Anan's spokesman, Hazem Hosny, told Reuters. The identity of the men is unknown. 
The Interior Ministry could not be immediately reached for comment.
Security sources said the alleged attackers were being questioned at a police station along with Genena. The sources said the injuries were the result of a fight between Genena and the group of men. 
""His knee is broken and he is bleeding from several parts of his body ... they were trying to kill him,"" his wife, Wafaa Kedieh, told Reuters.
On Tuesday, an army statement read on state TV said Anan's presidential bid amounted to ""a serious breach of the laws of military service"" because as a military officer he was required to end his service and get permission before seeking office.
As Egypt's top auditor, Genena had stirred controversy by publicly concluding that government corruption has cost the country billions of dollars. He was sacked by Sisi in 2016.

KABUL (Reuters) - A bomb hidden in an ambulance killed at least 40 people and wounded about 140 in Afghanistan on Saturday when it blew up in an area of the capital near foreign embassies and government buildings.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast, a week after it claimed an attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul in which more than 20 people were killed.
""It is a massacre,"" said Dejan Panic, coordinator in Afghanistan for the Italian aid group Emergency, which runs a nearby trauma hospital. In a message on Twitter, the group said more than 50 wounded had been brought in to that hospital alone.
Health ministry spokesman Wahid Majroh said at least 40 people were killed and 140 wounded in the blast, which tore through a crowded street in a busy part of the city at lunchtime.
Saturday is a working day in Afghanistan.
Mirwais Yasini, a member of parliament who was nearby when the explosion occurred, said the ambulance approached the checkpoint, close to an office of the High Peace Council and several foreign embassies, and blew up.
Buildings hundreds of meters (yards) away were shaken by the force of the explosion, which left torn bodies strewn on the street nearby amid rubble and debris.
People helped walking-wounded away as ambulances with sirens wailing inched their way through the traffic-clogged streets of the city center.
The latest attack will add pressure on President Ashraf Ghani and his U.S. allies, who have expressed growing confidence that a new more aggressive military strategy has succeeded in driving Taliban insurgents back from major provincial centers.
The United States has stepped up its assistance to Afghan security forces and increased its air strikes against the Taliban and other militant groups, aiming to break a stalemate and force the insurgents to the negotiating table.

However, the Taliban have dismissed suggestions that they have been weakened by the new strategy and the latest attacks have demonstrated that their capacity to mount deadly, high- profile attacks remains undiminished.

603,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",Irish Prime Minister says he will campaign for liberalization of abortion laws,"LONDON (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Saturday that he would campaign for a liberalization of the country's restrictive abortion laws ahead of a referendum in the coming months, adding that his views on the issue had evolved. 
Varadkar's government plans to hold the referendum as soon as May to loosen some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world. His Fine Gael party has agreed to let individual members campaign on either side of the debate. 
While the country remains overwhelmingly Catholic - a complete ban on abortion was only lifted in 2013 - public opinion has become far more socially liberal in recent years. 
Varadkar, a medical doctor by training, in 2014 described himself as pro-life, but also said that the rules in Ireland, where terminations are only allowed in cases where the mother's life is in danger, were too tight. 
""I believe Ireland's abortion laws are too restrictive and need to be liberalised,"" Varadkar said in an interview with BBC radio on Saturday. ""I'll be campaigning for them to be changed.""
MISUNDERSTOOD
Asked about his previous position, Varadkar said that his views had evolved in recent years. 
""I think sometimes that pro-life and pro-choice can be misunderstood ... I think even people who are in favor of abortion in certain circumstances are pro-life,"" he said. 
""These terms pro-life and pro-choice don't really comprehend the complexity of this issue, which is a very private and personal one and one, I think, that contains a lot of gray areas.""
Ireland has yet to decide the exact wording of the referendum. A cross-party parliamentary committee last month recommended that the state legislate to allow terminations with no restrictions up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy, a more liberal position than some had anticipated.
An opinion poll on Friday found that a majority of Irish voters would support a proposal to allow abortion up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy, but that many older voters opposed the change.

No ceasefire was formally announced by Russia or the Syrian government, whose army has besieged the enclave outside Damascus for years and has stepped up its bombardment there in recent months. 
Five bombardments targeted eastern Ghouta overnight, including with rocket strikes and artillery shells, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. 
Russia is the main external supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his war against rebels seeking to oust him. 
A ninth round of U.N.-sponsored peace talks ended in Vienna on Friday without result. 
Ayman al-Asemi, a member of the Free Syrian Army's military council, said late on Friday that Russia had made a pledge to opposition negotiators in Vienna that it would press Damascus to enforce a ceasefire in eastern Ghouta. 
However, Nasser al-Hariri, head of the opposition delegation in Vienna, did not mention eastern Ghouta or any ceasefire agreement during a news conference on Saturday. 
The Vienna talks ended with the opposition saying it would not attend a Syrian peace congress that Russia is holding next week in Sochi. 
Hariri said the decision not to attend was made after a vote among the opposition groups that form the delegation and that he hoped the Sochi meeting would still prove useful. He said Russia had not put pressure on the delegation to attend. 
International concern has been rising over the fate of eastern Ghouta, where the United Nations says acute food and medicine shortages have contributed to the worst malnutrition seen in the Syrian civil war. 

The enclave is home to almost 400,000 people and is in an agreed ""de-escalation zone"" under Russian-led truce deals for rebel-held territory, but the fighting there has continued.

ANKARA (Reuters) - The United States has told Turkey it will not provide any more weapons to the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday, as Turkey's offensive against the U.S.-backed YPG in Syria entered its eighth day.
The Turkish incursion in northwest Syria's Afrin region against the YPG has opened a new front in the multi-sided Syrian civil war, but has also further strained ties with NATO ally Washington.
Washington has angered Ankara by providing arms, training and air support to the Syrian Kurdish forces. Turkey sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a deadly insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast for three decades.
The Turkish presidency said in a statement on Saturday that Ibrahim Kalin, spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan, and U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster held a phone call on Friday in which McMaster confirmed the United States would no longer provide weapons to the YPG.
On Thursday, the Pentagon said it carefully tracked weapons provided to the YPG and would continue discussions with Turkey, after Ankara urged Washington to end its support for the YPG or risk confronting Turkish forces on the ground in Syria.
On Friday, Erdogan said Turkish forces would sweep Kurdish fighters from the Syrian border and could push all the way east to the frontier with Iraq - a move which risks a possible confrontation with U.S. forces allied to the Kurds.
Since the start of the incursion, dubbed ""Operation Olive Branch"" by Ankara, Erdogan has said Turkish forces would push east towards the town of Manbij, part of Kurdish-held territory some 100 km (60 miles) east of Afrin, where U.S. troops were deployed to deter Turkish and U.S.-backed rebels from clashing.
Any Turkish advance towards Manbij could threaten U.S. efforts to stabilize northern Syria, where the United States has about 2,000 troops, officially as part of the international coalition against Islamic State.
In a sign of growing bilateral tensions, Ankara and Washington disagreed over the main message of a phone call between Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump held on Wednesday.
The White House said Trump had urged Erdogan to curtail the military operation in Syria, while Turkey said Erdogan had told Trump that U.S. troops should withdraw from Manbij. 
Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said she had seen media reports about the phone call, but was not aware of any change in U.S. posture.

The Turkish presidency said Kalin and McMaster had agreed for Turkey and the United States to remain in close coordination to ""avoid misunderstandings"".

Agnes Chow, a member of the pro-democracy Demosisto party which wants self-determination for the city, had planned to run for the Hong Kong Island constituency. 
""'Self-determination' or changing the HKSAR system by referendum which includes the choice of independence is inconsistent with the constitutional and legal status of the HKSAR as stipulated in the Basic Law,"" the government said in a statement, referring to the mini-constitution.
Hong Kong is a special administrative region (SAR) of China, governed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula since its return from British rule in 1997, allowing freedoms not enjoyed on mainland China that include an independent judiciary but not a fully democratic vote. 
""Hong Kong Demosisto has never had a pro-independence stance but we believe Hong Kong people have the right to self-determination on the future of Hong Kong,"" Chow told reporters. 
""Our political freedom should be well protected under the legal system of Hong Kong. The decision to disqualify my candidacy means that the political rights are being handicapped.""
Demosisto described the ban as ""payback"" against an entire generation.
""Demosisto members have both been imprisoned and barred from entering the political establishment. The government’s motivation is to demolish the youth’s desire to push forward social change in Hong Kong,"" it said in a statement. ""Momentum gained from the Umbrella movement will be absent from the legislature."" 
On Tuesday, Chow's close friend and student protest leader Joshua Wong was released on bail, less than a week after he was jailed for a second time for the Umbrella movement pro-democracy protests in 2014 that blocked the Chinese-ruled city's major roads for months.
The protests marked the semi-autonomous city's largest show of defiance against Beijing rule since 1997.
The by-election is one of several made necessary after the Chinese parliament issued a legal interpretation that eventually led to the debarring of six opposition lawmakers, leaving the pro-democracy camp with 24 seats in the 70-seat legislature and also effectively taking away some of its veto powers.
If Chow's candidacy had been approved and she had gone on to win her seat, she would have been Hong Kong's youngest ever lawmaker.

608,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2018 12:38AM ET</span>",Pakistan police killing of a Pashtun youth fuels anger over 'encounters',"By Syed Raza Hassan
KARACHI (Reuters) - Nationwide protests at the police killing of a young ethnic Pashtun man in Pakistan's largest city have shone a spotlight on allegations of persecution by the authorities against refugees from the country's conflict-ridden northwest.
The country's Supreme Court launched an inquiry on Jan. 19 into the death of 27-year-old aspiring fashion model Naqibullah Mehsud. He was one of four men killed six days earlier in what police initially said was a shoot-out with suspected Islamist militants. The Supreme Court plans to begin hearings on the case on Saturday.
The police team that killed Mehsud was under the command of senior superintendent Anwar Ahmed Khan, who has been suspended since Jan. 20 on the recommendation of a police inquiry committee. The committee was set up after Mehsud's father, Muhammad Khan Mehsud, who denies his son had any militant links, filed a kidnapping and killing complaint against him.
Anwar told Reuters he had done nothing wrong and said the investigation into his officers' actions could allow the Taliban to regain a foothold in ethnic Pashtun parts of the city.
""I had no knowledge of Naqibullah Mehsud. My staff told me that he is a militant with a criminal history,"" he said. 
Police data from 2011 reviewed by Reuters shows that in the seven years Anwar has been in charge of Karachi's Malir district, which has a large Pashtun population, at least 450 people have been killed in 200 clashes with police that involved weapons. The data does not give details of the circumstances of the shootings.
A senior police official, who asked not to be identified, said that the majority of those killed were ethnic Pashtuns. Pakistan's ethnic Pashtun borderlands have been a hotbed of Islamist militancy in recent decades.
MILITANT POLICY
Pakistani police refer to any armed clash with suspects as an ""encounter"". Some human rights activists and families of victims have for years alleged that such incidents are often staged to cover up extrajudicial killings.
Anwar told Reuters that armed operations to kill suspects were official police policy in Sindh Province, of which Karachi is the capital, to combat the threat from militants.
""There was an on-going official policy ... for carrying out encounters to take out criminals and I have broken no law,"" he said.
The provincial police chief denied there was such a policy.
""I don't need to respond to irresponsible allegations,"" Inspector General of Sindh police Allah Dino Khawaja said in a brief text message in reply to Reuters' questions. ""He has to appear before the investigation to defend and prove his claims.""
Sindh police said in a statement on Jan. 20 it had launched an inquiry ""to ascertain the facts regarding the police encounter in which Naqibullah Mehsud was killed"".
Some campaigners among the sprawling city's Pashtun community say the story is not unusual. But it is the first to receive nationwide attention - in part because Mehsud, known as Naqib, does not fit the image of the militant from Pakistan's lawless northern heartlands.
""He had a passion for wearing good clothes ... even in the picture of his body circulating on social media, he is seen wearing good clothes,"" his cousin Noor Rehman told Reuters, while holding back tears.
Another senior police officer said no evidence linking Naqib to militancy had been found.
""His particulars were checked in all the criminal databases of police and nothing came up,"" the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
Pakistan's chief justice on Tuesday summoned Anwar to appear for questioning at its first hearing this weekend. Earlier that day, he was not allowed to board a flight leaving Pakistan for Dubai, Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency said.
Anwar told Reuters he does not plan to appear before the court. He said his children are studying in Dubai and he frequently visits.
TARGET GROUP
Pashtuns are Pakistan's second largest ethnic group, and many have moved to the country's big cities to escape violence along the Afghan border. 
But since the emergence of the Pakistani Taliban, whose leadership also comes from the Mehsud tribe in South Waziristan, Pashtuns who spoke to Reuters in Karachi say they are all now seen as potential militants. 
""This is not just about the fact that police are killing people, it is about racial profiling,"" Jibran Nasir, a human rights lawyer who said he was filing a petition with the Senate's human rights committee, told Reuters.
""Naqib had a very public profile. Looking at pictures of Naqib modeling ... no one is willing to believe he had anything to do with Taliban. The problem here is not every Pashtun killed and profiled here is a model.""
Figures posted by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on its website show 1,226 people were killed in 784 police encounters nationwide in the past two years. 
In the days after Mehsud was killed, thousands of activists and Pashtun students staged protests in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Islamabad and Quetta.
In Sohrab Goth, the majority Pashtun suburb of Karachi where Naqib's family live, three families told Reuters they had lost relatives in such incidents.
    Reuters was shown death certificates and newspaper clippings, but was not able to independently confirm the circumstances of their deaths.
Sohail Anwer Sial, home minister in the Sindh provincial government whose department is responsible for the police, said the authorities were taking action over the Mehsud case, but that one or two incidents did not mean the entire police force was corrupt. 
""The same police force ... eradicated violence from the city during Karachi operation', which began in 2013 against militants,"" he said. ""One person's actions cannot be allowed to malign the system.""

According to witness reports, Karla Garrufe, 21, died on Thursday morning after being gunned down by a man whose car she had bumped into from behind, said Miguel Angel Guerrero, a spokesman for prosecutors in Tijuana.
A witness said that after the two began arguing, the man pulled out a gun, shot her and drove off, he added.
The suspect has not been caught, prosecutors said.
In a statement, Uber expressed its condolences over what it called the ""terrible"" incident and said it was working with authorities to clear up the case. Uber said Garrufe was disconnected from the app when the shooting occurred.
Tijuana, which lies on the border with California, has been one of the areas worst hit by a spike in violence in Mexico that pushed murders to a record high last year.

U.S. PACIFIC COMMAND HEADQUARTERS, Hawaii (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis stressed diplomacy as the way to deal with the North Korean crisis on Friday during talks with his South Korean counterpart in Hawaii, a day after Seoul's top diplomat said a military solution would be unacceptable. 
""Diplomacy should (impose) reason on Kim's reckless rhetoric and dangerous provocations,"" Mattis said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 
He added that the response to the threat remained ""diplomacy led, backed up with military options available to ensure that our diplomats are understood to be speaking from a position of strength.""
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has said all options are on the table when it comes to North Korea's pursuit of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the United States.
But Mattis has consistently stressed non-military actions, including international sanctions. He renewed that message as he met South Korean Minister of Defense Song Young-moo at the U.S. Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii. 
Song said he expected to discuss North Korea with Mattis, but noted firm coordination between the two militaries.
""We both understand each other well and that as an alliance, we always go together,"" he said, speaking through a translator.
The exchange came a day after South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program must be resolved diplomatically, and added that she was certain Washington would consult her government first if a military option were to be considered.
She declined to comment if Washington had given Seoul clear assurance but added: ""This is our fate that is at stake. Any option that is to be taken on the Korean Peninsula, cannot be implemented without us going along.""
After their first formal talks in more than two years this month, officials from the two Koreas have been visiting each other to facilitate the North's participation in the Olympics, to be held in the South's alpine resort town of Pyeongchang.
North Korea has waged a publicity campaign around its attendance, calling on Thursday for ""all Koreans at home and abroad"" to promote inter-Korean cooperation. 
Kim's regime has also set a new anniversary to mark the formation of its military on Feb. 8 - the day before the start of the Games. Analysts say the nation may observe the day with a large military parade.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who will represent the United States at the Olympics, said on Tuesday he would seek to counter what he described as an effort by North Korea to ""hijack"" the Games with a propaganda campaign.

611,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>",Syrian opposition says will boycott Russia-brokered peace talks in Sochi,"By Francois Murphy
VIENNA (Reuters) - The Syrian opposition will not attend a peace conference Russia is hosting next week, a spokesman said on Saturday, dismissing the meeting as an attempt by the Syrian government's close ally to ""sideline"" the current United Nations peace process.
He was speaking at the end of two days of U.N.-brokered talks between the Syrian government and opposition, after which the host said the United Nations had not decided whether to attend the conference in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
Western powers and some Arab states believe Sochi is an attempt to create a separate peace process that would undermine the United Nations' efforts while laying the groundwork for a solution more suitable to Assad and his allies Russia and Iran.
""This whole round in Vienna was supposed to be a crucial one, a test for commitment. And we didn't see this commitment. And the U.N. didn't see this commitment,"" said Yahya al-Aridi, a spokesman for the opposition delegation at the Vienna talks.
Nine rounds of U.N. peace talks between the warring sides have made little progress toward ending the civil war in which hundreds of thousands have been killed and 11 million - a majority of the Syrian population - driven from their homes.
Previous rounds of talks have been held sporadically in Geneva, with a mandate to discuss new elections, reformed governance, a new constitution and the fight against terrorism.
Having regained the upper hand on the battlefield after nearly seven years of conflict, Assad appears unwilling to negotiate with his enemies at all, let alone step down as part of any peaceful solution as rebels and opposition groups have demanded.
""It's quite clear that somebody there is obstructing the whole process and wanting to sideline the importance of Geneva, the political process as a whole,"" al-Aridi said. 
As the talks dragged into Friday evening, another spokesman for the opposition said it had received a pledge from Russia that it would press the Syrian army to enforce a ceasefire in the besieged rebel enclave of eastern Ghouta, near Damascus.
Syrian army and Russian jets have for the last two months been escalating their bombardment of the area, killing dozens of civilians and injuring hundreds, rebels and aid workers say.
With Aridi later announcing that the opposition would not attend the talks, it was unclear where that left the ceasefire plan.
'TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE'
Syrian government forces are pursuing offensives against two remaining rebel pockets, Idlib in the northwest and eastern Ghouta near Damascus. Turkey has poured troops into the north to fight Kurdish militias that have established regional autonomy and are seen by Ankara as a menace to its security.
A document drawn up by the United States, Jordan, Britain, France and Saudi Arabia made recommendations to the Vienna talks' host, U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura, for what they called a ""practical approach"" to what would be a ""slow"" U.N. political process.
The document's recommendations included ""a specific and immediate focus on discussion of a reformed constitution and organization of free and fair elections"", language that was echoed by the opposition delegation in Vienna.
But the Syrian government's envoy to the talks, Bashar al-Ja'afari, dismissed the document as ""totally unacceptable"".
""Our people have not and will never accept a solution that is parachuted onto them or that is carried on tanks,"" he said in a statement to reporters.
""The goal of the conference in Sochi is to engage in a national intra-Syrian dialogue without foreign interference. The conference will be attended by about 1,600 participants who will reflect the various components of Syrian society,"" he added.
Al-Aridi, however, said Sochi was aimed at giving the appearance of reconciliation among Syrians and many of those participants had been chosen by Damascus. 
The opposition scheduled a news conference for 0900 GMT on Saturday.
De Mistura said U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres would decide how the United Nations would respond to the invitation to attend Sochi. He added that Russia said Sochi was aimed at supporting the U.N. process.

""I took note of the statement by the Russian Federation that the outcome of the (Sochi) congress would be brought to Geneva as a contribution to the intra-Syrian talks process under the auspices of the U.N."", he said.

612,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 07:37PM ET</span>","Pro-Russian president, academic challenger face off in dead-heat Czech presidential vote","By Robert Muller
PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czechs finish voting on Saturday in a presidential election run-off where pro-western academic Jiri Drahos is trying to oust incumbent Milos Zeman, whose courting of Russia and China and leaning toward far-right groups have split the nation.
The election is seen as a referendum on Zeman, 73. The last prominent figure among active politicians from the country's transitional period in the 1990s, he has pleased some but alienated others by publicly belittling opponents ranging from the last prime minister to intellectual elites to the press.
The vote, expected to be almost even, reflects the divisions between liberals and conservatives seen elsewhere in Europe and the United States. Zeman has taken a tough stance on migration and backed Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
The Czech constitution gives presidents limited executive powers, but Zeman has not hesitated to test the boundaries. In 2013, for example, he appointed a caretaker government of his allies for five months in 2013 against the will of parliament.
While the last poll put Drahos, 68, three percentage points ahead of the incumbent, betting odds showed the opposite, slightly favoring Zeman.
A victory by Drahos could bring a voice more in tune with the European Union into the Czech politics and set it apart from its ex-communist peers Poland and Hungary, who have locked horns with the EU.
""Zeman never questioned the Czech membership in the EU, but on the other hand he said he would welcome a referendum on exit and in practice he significantly deviated from both EU and NATO,"" said political analyst Michael Romancov.
""It is clear that Jiri Drahos is unequivocally pro-EU and an euro-Atlantic candidate.""
Zeman has benefited from rising Czech hostility to immigration, although the country received just 116 asylum applications between January and November last year.
Both he and Drahos have rejected the refugee quotas, but unlike Zeman, Drahos has said he country should differentiate between economic migrants and war refugees and follow its asylum procedures. 
Prime Minister Andrej Babis, a businessman who has ruled as a caretaker since his minority cabinet lost a confidence vote in parliament last week, is backing Zeman. 
Zeman also backs Babis. His term ends on March 7, but he has pledged to give Babis a second chance to form a government regardless of the election result. He even said that the process would be accelerated if he lost to Drahos.
The two candidates are as dissimilar personally as they are politically. Zeman is brash, with a self-advertised appetite for alcohol and tobacco. His health is a concern - he suffers from diabetes, which makes him walk with a cane. Drahos is a soft-spoken chemistry professor.
And by the same token, voters are split between those who see Zeman as embarrassment and those who think Drahos is colorless and lack in want of strong views.
""I vote Drahos, because he is more acceptable and he will represent our country well,"" said Marie Havlickova, a pensioner.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 07:37PM ET</span>",Prominent businessmen reach settlements in Saudi corruption probe: source,"By Katie Paul
RIYADH (Reuters) - Several prominent businessmen have reached financial settlements with Saudi Arabian authorities in the kingdom's sweeping crackdown on corruption, an official source told Reuters on Friday.
They include Waleed al-Ibrahim, owner of regional television network MBC; Fawaz  Alhokair , a major shareholder in fashion retailer Fawaz Abdulaziz Alhokair Co (SE:4240); Khalid al-Tuwaijri, a former chief of the Royal Court; and Turki bin Nasser, a former head of the country's meteorology and environmental protection agency, the source said.
The source, speaking on condition of anonymity under briefing rules, did not reveal the terms of the settlements, but he denied a report in London's Financial Times that said Ibrahim was giving up his ownership of MBC. 
""The report is totally untrue and his ownership has not changed even by one share,"" the source told Reuters. ""The settlement was related to other matters which we are not entitled to discuss, and he left today.""
An email sent to MBC employees by MBC's chief executive Sam Barnett and seen by Reuters said Ibrahim had been released from detention and was with members of his family in Riyadh.
Ibrahim and the other men could not immediately be reached for comment, and it was not clear what allegations they had faced.
Dozens of princes, senior officials and top businessmen were detained when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched the crackdown in early November. Suspects were accused of crimes such as money laundering, bribery and extorting officials.
Authorities said they aimed to reach financial settlements with most suspects and believed they could raise some $100 billion for the government this way - a huge windfall for the state, which has seen its finances squeezed by low oil prices.
The latest settlements suggest the main part of the purge may be drawing to a close, a relief for investors in the companies run by the suspects, some of which have seen their share prices tumble.
Earlier this week, the attorney general said authorities were still holding 95 people in the campaign, while 90 detainees had been released after having charges dropped and others had traded cash, real estate and other assets for their freedom. Some suspects will face trial if they do not settle.
In late November, senior Saudi Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, once seen as a leading contender to the throne, was freed after reaching a settlement with authorities that involved paying more than $1 billion, according to a Saudi official.

One top businessman who is still being held is billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman and owner of global investment firm  Kingdom  Holding (SE:4280). A Saudi official told Reuters this month that he was negotiating a possible settlement but so far had not agreed on terms.

MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States added Russian officials and energy firms to a sanctions blacklist on Friday, days before details of further possible penalties against Moscow are due to be released.
Washington could release reports as early as Monday laying out the possibilities for expanded sanctions against Russia over its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, an accusation the Kremlin has repeatedly denied.
Leading Democrats in the U.S. Congress wrote to Trump on Friday, demanding that the administration use Monday's deadline to retaliate for what they described as cyber attacks intended to influence other countries' elections.
A Treasury Department spokesperson said the department is ""actively working"" on reports required under the ""Countering America's Adversaries Through Terrorism Act"" and aimed to release them consistent with timelines in the legislation.
Russia is already under U.S. sanctions over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and support for separatist rebels fighting in eastern Ukraine.
On Friday, Treasury said it had added 21 people and nine companies to the sanctions list, including some that were involved in the delivery of  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) gas turbines to Crimea.
It said Friday's announcement was not related to the reports due on Monday.
""This action underscores the U.S. government’s opposition to Russia’s occupation of Crimea and firm refusal to recognize its attempted annexation of the peninsula,"" the department said in a statement.
MANY TENSIONS
The Ukraine-related sanctions represent one of many areas of tension between the United States and Russia, including over how to end the Syrian civil war and whether to hold to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, despite U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign emphasis on improving ties with Moscow.
One person added to the list was Russian Deputy Energy Minister Andrey Cherezov, who was put under sanctions by the European Union over his role in the delivery of turbines to Crimea last year.
Also added was Sergey Topor-Gilka, head of the Russian engineering company Technopromexport, as well as multiple subsidiaries of oil producer Surgutneftegaz (MM:SNGS).
A spokeswoman for Rostec, which is already subject to U.S. sanctions and is the parent company of Technopromexport, said the company regretted that the main U.S. main tool in international relations was pressure and not dialogue.
The Russian Energy Ministry declined immediate comment.
Daniel Fried, a former U.S. State Department expert, said he viewed Friday's announcement as ""sanctions maintenance"" - essentially targeting individuals and entities that have taken the place of others who have earlier been sanctioned.
""To make sure a sanctions regime is effective, you need to update it periodically. You don’t simply target people and let it sit, because other people fill in and do the same bad deeds that you targeted the first ones for,"" Fried said.
RIA news agency quoted Vladimir Dzhabarov, deputy chairman of the international affairs committee of Russia's upper house of parliament, as saying: ""This is not a policy of sanctions, it is a policy of containing a growing Russia as much as possible. The Americans declared war on us. We draw conclusions from this and move on.""
Separately, the United States could release reports as early as Monday outlining the scope for expanding sanctions against Russia, including a list of prominent oligarchs and potential restrictions on the holding of Russian government debt.
The sanctions law Trump signed on Aug. 2 requires Treasury to prepare a list of the most significant Russian oligarchs ""as determined by their closeness to the Russian regime and their net worth.""
This will be accompanied by a report ""describing in detail the potential effects of expanding sanctions ... to include sovereign debt and the full range of derivative products.""

Both reports are due to be sent to Congress by the end of January, weeks before Russia is due to vote in a presidential election that President Vladimir Putin is widely expected to win.

LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Aung San Suu Kyi remains Myanmar's best hope for change, veteran U.S. mediator Bill Richardson said on Friday, days after he got into a fight with the Nobel laureate and quit an international panel advising her government on the Rohingya crisis.
Richardson said Suu Kyi - whom he described as a long-time friend - had developed a ""siege mentality"" in her position as Myanmar's State Counsellor, the country's civilian leader, but added that Western governments should continue to engage with her.
""The relationship with the West, with human rights groups, with the United Nations, with the international media is terrible,"" he told Reuters by phone from New Mexico on Friday.
""And I think Aung San Suu Kyi has brought this upon herself, the constant disparagement of the international community, which I think can be helpful to her ... She seems isolated. She doesn't travel much into the country. I think she's developed a classic bubble.""
Richardson said he resigned from the advisory board on Wednesday, during its first visit to troubled Rakhine State, saying it was conducting a ""whitewash"". Suu Kyi's office said on Thursday her government had asked Richardson to step down and accused him of pursuing ""his own agenda"".
Suu Kyi's government said on Friday it did not want discuss the details of the exchange between Suu Kyi and Richardson any further. 
Around 688,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from Rakhine to Bangladesh in recent months to escape an army crackdown following insurgent attacks on security forces.
""I think the Myanmar military is to blame a lot and the only person that can turn them around, I believe, is Aung San Suu Kyi, and she should start doing that,"" said Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President Bill Clinton who has also worked as a mediator with North Korea.
Richardson said he had informed the U.S. ambassador in Yangon and the State Department of his intention to resign but had not sought their guidance.
Richardson said that before his trip to Myanmar, he spoke to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who visited the country in November. ""He called me and gave me a briefing on his visit and that was all,"" he told Reuters in a separate television interview.
A State Department spokesman said he could not immediately confirm details of Richardson's contacts.
FURIOUS ARGUMENT
A statement on Thursday from the nine remaining members of the advisory board said they met this week ""with open minds"" and rejected Richardson's criticism that he feared the panel would be used as ""a cheerleading squad"".
Richardson said Suu Kyi's response at a Monday night dinner was ""furious"" when he brought up the case of two Reuters reporters, who were arrested on Dec. 12 on suspicion of violating Myanmar's Official Secrets Act.
""She was very angry with me when I raised releasing the journalists, giving them a fair trial,"" he said. 
""She was upset when I said there should be an investigation of the mass-graves issue, that they had to increase their international support for the treatment of the Rohingyas, the terrible refugee crisis. She exploded. She was very unhappy, and it shows that she didn't want to hear frank advice.""
Her office said it would not be commenting further on the exchange. 
""We already published a statement and also the advisory board published a statement. The judge will decide whether the journalists committed the crime or not. It is Contempt of Court. Even in America, they wouldn't involve themselves in a case while the case is ongoing in a court hearing,"" said Zaw Htay, Suu Kyi's spokesman. 
Reporters Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, had worked on Reuters coverage of the crisis in Rakhine.
Richardson said it was important for Western governments, the United Nations and Suu Kyi to enter into a new dialogue ""to try to help each other, not to keep fighting each other"" before any thoughts of new sanctions on Myanmar.
""What we don't want is to have Aung San Suu Kyi just listen to ASEAN countries, China or Russia. They need engagement with the West. We're all former friends. She needs to change, and perhaps the West needs to give her another chance and not impose sanctions.""
Myanmar's armed forces have been accused by Rohingya witnesses and human rights activists of carrying out killings, rapes and arson in Rakhine in a campaign senior officials in the United Nations and United States have described as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar rejects that label and has denied nearly all the allegations.
Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed earlier this month to complete the voluntary repatriation of all the refugees. The remaining members of the advisory board on Wednesday toured temporary camps the government has set up for returnees.
Richardson said he did not believe conditions were yet right for the repatriation process to begin. 

""I believe that the Myanmar government has emphasized speed instead of systems,"" he said. ""There's been too much emphasis on quick results rather than assuring that safety is guaranteed.""

619,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 06:05PM ET</span>",Canadian pharmaceutical billionaire couple was murdered: police,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian pharmaceutical billionaire couple Barry and Honey Sherman were murdered in a targeted killing, Toronto police investigators said on Friday in their first detailed comments on the case since the couple's bodies were found on Dec. 15. 
Police said they are treating the case as a double murder, but declined to say if they had any suspects. 
The Shermans were found hanging by belts from a railing next to a swimming pool at their Toronto mansion, police said. 
Toronto homicide detective Susan Gomes said at a press conference that authorities believed the Shermans were targeted, but did not elaborate.
Police have ""an extensive list of people we're looking forward to speaking to,"" she said. 
The Sherman family said in a statement that it had expected police would classify the deaths as homicides.
The family hired a private investigator in late December and conducted an independent autopsy after complaining that police mishandled the case in its early days. 
Citing unnamed police sources, multiple news organizations had reported last month that investigators were operating on the working theory that the deaths were a murder-suicide. 
Gomes said those reports were wrong and that investigators initially reviewed three possibilities: double suicide, murder suicide and double homicide.
Sherman was 75 and his wife was 70. Their deaths stunned the worlds of Canadian business, politics and philanthropy, and drew public condolences from prominent figures including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who attended a memorial service on Dec. 21 that was broadcast on television. 
Barry Sherman founded Apotex Inc in 1974 and built it into a pharmaceutical giant before stepping down as chief executive in 2012. He and his wife were known for their donations to hospitals, universities and Jewish organizations.
Separately, Apotex said on Friday that its Chief Executive Jeremy Desai had resigned and would be replaced by his predecessor and company co-founder Jack Kay. 
Apotex is in a legal dispute with Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries (TA:TEVA) (N:TEVA), the world's biggest maker of generic drugs, over allegations that a former Teva executive shared trade secrets with Desai.
An Apotex representative said Desai's departure was not related to Teva's lawsuit against Apotex.

Reuters could not immediately reach Desai for comment.

(Reuters) - The teenaged boy who opened fire in a Kentucky high school this week, killing two students and wounding many others, appeared not to have targeted his victims and shot at random, a local prosecutor said on Friday.
Three security cameras captured the Tuesday morning incident in Marshall County High School's common area, Commonwealth's Attorney Mark Blankenship told Reuters in an email on Friday. 
""The video clearly shows what happened,"" Blankenship said. ""We have no information to indicate that he had any particular target in mind."" 
Authorities have not yet released the name of the 15-year-old suspect in the attack in Benton, Kentucky, about 120 miles (190 km) northwest of Nashville, Tennessee. Officials also declined to say where the boy is being held or when he is next due in court. 
""This community is so devastated over this,"" Blankenship said in a separate phone interview with Reuters on Thursday evening. ""There might be someone who would hurt him if they could get to him."" 
The incident was the latest outbreak of gun violence in a nation where school shootings have become not uncommon.
The parents of the suspect as well as the parents of the two victims who were fatally shot attended a closed detention hearing on Wednesday, said Blankenship, who observed the proceeding. 
""They seemed to be suffering as bad as the parents of the victims,"" Blankenship said. The judge ordered participants not to discuss details of the hearing, Blankenship added.
The wounded comprised five female and 13 male students, all 14 to 18 years old, authorities have said.
Blankenship said he will prosecute the case and seek the stiffest penalty possible if the boy is charged as an adult, though another prosecutor will handle the case if the suspect is charged as a juvenile. 
""This is just as bad as it gets,"" Blankenship said. ""I don't know how we couldn't treat that with the most serious consequences."" 

The boy faces two counts of murder and at least 12 counts of first-degree assault, Blankenship said. Each murder count carries a punishment of 20 years to life in prison, he said. Each count of assault in the first degree carries 10 to 20 years.

SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge late on Thursday said President Donald Trump's administration cannot immediately deport 92 Cambodian citizens from the United States without first allowing them a chance to challenge the action in court.
U.S. immigration authorities conducted raids last October and arrested approximately 100 Cambodians, many of whom had fled the Khmer Rouge government in the 1970s. 
After arriving in the United States, the Cambodians had been convicted of various criminal charges, and ordered deported years ago. However Cambodia refused to repatriate them, so they were released from immigration custody and many held down jobs until they were re-arrested last year. 
In ongoing negotiations over immigration reform, the Trump administration is seeking stronger measures against immigrants who have been ordered deported but whose home countries refused to accept them, a senior administration official said. 
In a ruling on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney in Santa Ana, California federal court ruled that 92 of the Cambodians still in custody could raise ""serious questions"" about the validity of their underlying convictions and deportation orders. 
The government said the Cambodians' request should be rejected because they knew they could be deported at any instant, an argument the judge called insensitive.
""It is disingenuous for the Government to claim that throughout the many years that Petitioners were permitted to live and work on supervised release, they should not have built up any expectation that they would be permitted to remain in the country,"" Carney wrote.
A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Three other U.S. judges have issued similar rulings stopping the government from quickly deporting immigrants who have long lived in the country, said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project who represents the Cambodians.
Those rulings involved Iraqis, Indonesians and Somalians, he said.

""In each case, the courts have soundly rejected the administration's claim that it is necessary to abruptly remove these long term residents without giving them due process,"" Gelernt said.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish lawmakers approved a bill on Friday that makes it a crime, punishable by up to three years in prison, to use statements suggesting Poland bears responsibility for crimes against humanity committed by Nazi Germany.
The bill will also make it illegal to deny the murder of about 100,000 Poles by units in the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) during World War Two, a move likely to increase tensions with neighboring Ukraine. Artistic and scientific activity will be exempt. 
Poles have fought for years against the use of phrases like ""Polish death camps"", which suggest Poland was at least partly responsible for the camps where millions people, mostly Jews, were killed by Nazi Germany. The camps were built and operated by the Nazis after they invaded Poland in 1939.
""This amendment equips Poland with the most important tools that have long been at the disposal of other countries"" Deputy Justice Minister Patryk Jaki told state news agency PAP.
Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has invoked Poles' suffering under Nazi occupation - including a death penalty for those who helped Jews - to respond to historical accounts that some Poles also committed crimes against the Jews during the war.
PiS is currently battling accusations from the opposition that the party's nationalist-minded, eurosceptic focus was helping to reinvigorate the far right.
The head of the Ukrainian national remembrance institute said on social media on Thursday that passing of the bill was likely to halt cooperation between Ukrainian and Polish historians, the PAP agency reported.
In November, Ukraine summoned the Polish ambassador in an escalation of a diplomatic spat over the two neighbors' troubled past.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States will seek to boost its case for United Nations action against Iran when Security Council envoys visit Washington on Monday to view pieces of weapons that U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley says Tehran gave to Yemen's Houthi group.
Haley and her 14 council colleagues will also lunch with President Donald Trump, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said Friday.
The Trump administration has for months been lobbying for Iran to be held accountable at the United Nations, while at the same time threatening to quit a 2015 deal among world powers to curb Iran's nuclear program if ""disastrous flaws"" are not fixed.
The U.N. ambassadors will visit a military hangar at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling near Washington, where Haley, the U.S envoy to the United Nations, last month presented remnants of what the Pentagon said was an Iranian-made ballistic missile fired from Yemen on Nov. 4 at Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh, as well as other weapons.
A proxy war is playing out in Yemen between Iran and U.S. ally Saudi Arabia.
Iran has denied supplying the Houthis with such weaponry and described the arms displayed in Washington as ""fabricated."" 
However, experts reported to the Security Council this month that Iran had violated U.N. sanctions on Yemen because ""it failed to take the necessary measures to prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer"" of short-range ballistic missiles and other equipment to the Iran-allied Houthi group.
The independent experts said they had ""identified missile remnants, related military equipment and military unmanned aerial vehicles that are of Iranian origin and were introduced into Yemen after the imposition of the targeted arms embargo.""
Haley said last month she was exploring several U.N. options for pressuring Iran to ""adjust their behavior"". But she is likely to struggle to convince some Security Council members, like veto powers Russia and China, that U.N. action is needed.
Most sanctions on Iran were lifted at the start of 2016 under the nuclear deal, which is enshrined in a U.N. Security Council resolution. The resolution still subjects Tehran to a U.N. arms embargo and other restrictions that are technically not part of the nuclear deal.
Haley has said the Security Council could strengthen the provisions in that resolution or adopt a new resolution banning Iran from all activities related to ballistic missiles. To pass, a resolution needs nine votes in favor, and no vetoes by the United States, Britain, France, China or Russia.
Under the current resolution, Iran is ""called upon"" to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years. Some states argue that the language of the resolution does not make it obligatory.
A separate U.N. resolution on Yemen bans the supply of weapons to Houthi leaders and ""those acting on their behalf or at their direction."" 
The United States could propose people or entities to be blacklisted by the council's Yemen sanctions committee, a closed-door move that would need consensus approval by the 15-members.

Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, say Haley has not signaled which accountability option she might pursue or when.

625,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Peru political deal paved way for Fujimori pardon - source,"By Mitra Taj and Marco Aquino
LIMA (Reuters) - Three months before he granted Alberto Fujimori a pardon on medical grounds, Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski met the jailed former leader's son, lawmaker Kenji Fujimori, to discuss his release, a source close to the president said.
After a ceremony at the ornate presidential palace where he grew up, Kenji asked Kuczynski to free his ailing father from prison and offered him political support in Congress in return, the source said on condition of anonymity.
A former Wall Street banker, Kuczynski was struggling to govern alongside the rightwing party, Popular Force, led by Fujimori's daughter and twice-defeated presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori. Popular Force had used its majority in Congress to oust key ministers in Kuczynski's government, delaying his plans to revive economic growth with infrastructure projects.
But Kuczynski found hope in Kenji, a 37-year-old congressman in Popular Force who was challenging his sister Keiko's leadership of their father's populist following.
Their meeting laid the foundation for a series of back-channel talks that paved the way for Fujimori's release, less than halfway into a 25-year prison sentence for graft and human rights violations, the source said.
""That's where trust in Kenji began,"" the source told Reuters, in one of three meetings in recent weeks.
Mediators visited Fujimori half a dozen times in his jail cell as part of the negotiations, and communication between the executive and father-and-son duo has continued following the pardon, the source added.
Support from Kenji and his supporters in Congress will be crucial to Kuczynski as he seeks to calm the turmoil that has threatened his political survival and Peru's status as one of the most promising emerging markets in Latin America.
Kuczynski's spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. His office has repeatedly denied the pardon was a political deal.
Kenji's spokesman denied the pardon was politically motivated.
Kuczynski said publicly in mid-2017 he was considering pardoning Fujimori, who at 79 suffers from heart and blood pressure problems, because he feared he would die in prison.
But two government sources and a former government official said a pardon had also been discussed as a way to divide Popular Force by giving Kenji a victory at the expense of Keiko.
KENJI'S AVENGERS
In their meeting in September, Kenji told Kuczynski that he and other disgruntled Popular Force lawmakers could help him govern through the end of his term in 2021, the source close to Kuczynski said.
The president planned to grant the pardon during the third week of December, but a push to impeach him led by Keiko's loyalists provided an early test of the budding alliance with Kenji, said the source close to Kuczynski.
Kenji promised Kuczynski at least three or four votes to help thwart the impeachment motion, the source said.
In the end, nine Popular Force lawmakers followed Kenji in breaking with party ranks to help save Kuczynski. The president pardoned Fujimori just three days later, triggering protests, political resignations and calls from Kuczynski's former leftist and centrist supporters for him to resign.
Elected in 1990, Fujimori, now 79, is a deeply divisive figure in Peru. While some consider him a corrupt dictator, others credit him with saving Peru from economic ruin and leftist rebels during his decade-long authoritarian rule.
Recent polls show a majority of Peruvians support the pardon, and Kenji's approval rating has eclipsed his sister's after it was granted.
Kenji is widely seen as having interest in running in 2021, when Kuczynski cannot seek reelection due to term limits. Once Fujimori was pardoned, he crossed ""free my father"" off of his to-do list for 2017 on Twitter, and posted a cartoon depicting his rebel faction in Popular Force as the superhero team the Avengers.
""Let's work for governability,"" Kenji wrote.

627,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 01:06PM ET</span>",UK spells out Brexit transition demands as pressure mounts on PM May,"By Elizabeth Piper
TEESPORT, England (Reuters) - Britain wants to benefit from European Union trade deals and have a say over EU laws passed during its transition out of the bloc, Brexit minister David Davis said on Friday, seeking to defuse tension between senior ministers over the interim deal. 
Davis set out the government's position on a transition period, looking to offer something for both those who want to keep close ties with the European Union after leaving and those who want a more radical break.
The balancing act, designed to appease both business and Brexiteers, is a taste of things to come for Prime Minister Theresa May, who has been unable to prevent divisions in her party repeatedly spilling out into the open. 
On Thursday, finance minister Philip Hammond was rebuked by May's office after saying he hoped Britain would diverge from the EU only ""very modestly"" after Brexit. He spoke hours before the head of a hardline group of Brexiteer lawmakers urged May to stop accepting negotiating terms set by the EU.
""It’s only by being outside the EU but continuing with the existing structures of rules and regulation that we can meet the requirements for a smooth, orderly and successful exit,"" Davis said in a speech at Teesport in northeast England.
""The existing international agreements we are party to should continue to apply during this period. They are an important part of the existing EU structure of rules and regulations, to which we will remain a party during the implementation period.""
WAY TO RESOLVE CONCERNS
Davis also said there needed to be some mechanism for Britain to query new laws introduced during the transition period, which it would be duty-bound to follow, and that the future jurisdiction of regulators needed to be clarified. 
""We will have to find a way, to agree a way, of resolving concerns if laws that are deemed to run contrary to our interests, and we have not had our say,"" he said.
There is little distance between Britain and the EU to overcome to agree the transitional deal, which will give the two sides time to prepare for the far-reaching impact of the end of more than 40 years of union.
Davis said he expected a political agreement on the transition deal at an EU summit on March 22-23 - a target Brussels is also working towards, with plans for fortnightly rounds of negotiations.
The EU is willing to be flexible on the duration and other terms of a Brexit transition period, which could include letting London sign trade deals, according to a document due to be formally endorsed by EU ministers on Monday.
Davis dismissed a question on whether he could really negotiate for Britain if senior members of the cabinet disagreed about what the transition deal should contain:
""There is no difference between the chancellor and myself and indeed the prime minister in terms of that we both want a Brexit which serves the British economy and serves the British people,"" he said. 
But May, who gambled on a snap election last year that cost her party its majority in parliament, is facing pressure from multiple angles: pro-EU lawmakers, hardline Brexiteers, and another contingent who question her leadership credentials and criticise a ""dull dull dull"" domestic agenda.
LETTERS OF NO CONFIDENCE
Several newspaper reports have said the number of letters expressing 'No Confidence' in the party leader is approaching the threshold of 48 required to trigger a leadership contest. The actual number is not made public by the party committee that holds them.
May is aware that the plan to change little of the current relationship immediately after Britain formally leaves on March 29, 2019, is fuelling anger among Brexit campaigners, who fear their mantra of ""taking back control"" is being sold out.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, who heads a hardline group of pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers that could have enough members to topple May, has said Britain must stop accepting negotiating terms set by the EU and that current transition plans would render it a ""vassal state"".
The febrile mood in the party is likely to linger; May has had to struggle to keep her lawmakers united over everything from transition to the future relationship to the so-called Brexit dividend - the funds that will be freed up when Britain stops paying into EU coffers.
But Davis said the prospect of an independent trade policy was worth waiting for.
""We must keep sight of the fact that this is a bridge to a new future partnership,"" he said. 

""... where, crucially, the United Kingdom is outside of the single market, and outside of the customs union; where the United Kingdom courts are sovereign once more; and where the United Kingdom can take advantage of its status as an independent trading nation.""

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Congolese President Joseph Kabila on Friday rejected charges that his forces had violently broken up pro-democracy protests, stirred by his refusal to step down at the end of his mandate.
After a week of simmering unrest following the shooting of protesting churchgoers in Kinshasa, Kabila gave his first news conference in six years and accused demonstrators of arson and attacking the police.
But he offered no firm word on when there could be new elections for president - the issue that has caused a wave of protests against his rule since his mandate expired at the end of 2016 - though he mentioned a high price tag on holding elections.
""I am not (and) ... will never be against peaceful protests by political parties,"" Kabila, wearing a dark suit and tie and sporting what has become his trademark goatee, told journalists in the presidential palace in Kinshasa. 
""But (not) if a political demonstration is intended to burn, kill police ... incinerate things.""
Scores of people have been killed in the past year in protests, organized by the Catholic Church, against Kabila's refusal to step down in December 2016, and delays in calling new elections.
Security forces shot dead at least six people and wounded dozens more last Sunday when they broke up a protest by churchgoers in the capital.
Kabila, who has been in power since his father was shot dead in office in 2001, has denied his opponents' charges that he is simply aiming to cling on to power for as long as he can.
The rising tide of protests has drawn condemnation from Western powers, including France, Britain, the United States and former colonial master Belgium. 
Under a deal mediated by the church between Kabila and his opponents, the president was to step down at the end of last year, paving the way for an election early this year.
But he reneged on the deal and elections will not take place until the end of 2018, at the earliest.
OPPONENTS' SUSPICIONS
Pressed on a date for the elections, Kabila said it was up to the electoral commission to set it.
Kabila's opponents suspect him of seeking a referendum to change Congo's constitution to enable him to run for more than two terms, as the leaders of neighboring Uganda, Rwanda and Congo Republic have. He has neither confirmed nor denied this.
""I have not seen anywhere in CENI's (the national electoral commission's) calendar where the organization of the referendum is planned,"" Kabila said, when asked about it. He also said elections would cost $1.2 billion, which he complained was ""exorbitant"".
Kabila's refusal to step down has emboldened armed rebel groups, raising the prospect of the vast, mineral-rich nation sliding back into the wars that killed millions of people in the 1990s, mostly from hunger and disease. 
It has also raised tensions with the United Nations peacekeeping mission (MONUSCO), which has often stepped in to defend Kabila's government against rebels but now sometimes finds itself having to shield civilians against Congolese forces.
""We have to clarify our relations with MONUSCO in the coming days,"" Kabila said. ""I hope they ... don't consider Congo as a country under the tutelage of the United Nations."" 

He did not elaborate.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's prisons ombdusman said on Friday that inmates in overcrowded jails were on the verge of mutinying as two weeks of work stoppages by wardens over pay and other complaints had made conditions intolerable.
The warning from independent ombudsman Adeline Hazan followed a second fruitless attempt by President Emmanuel Macron's justice minister to buy peace with the wardens.
""If this crisis is not brought to an immediate end, there's no telling what will happen,"" Hazan said. ""The situation is extremely tense...we're on the brink of a blowout.""
France's 188 prisons house about 70,000 convicts, one of the largest such populations in Europe.
The threat of an extended disruption is weighing on the government, which has had a relatively smooth start since it took power following Macron's election last May.
The wardens want higher starting salaries and great safety measures after a spate of attacks on them by inmates.
Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet, accused of reacting too slowly to frustration among wardens, defended what she called a ""significant"" offer of bonuses and improved security.
The proposal, which also includes plans to isolate many Islamist militants and other religiously radicalized inmates from the rest of the prison population, was rejected by two of three labor unions on Thursday.
The largest union broke ranks, however, saying it would sign up to the proposal, raising the prospect that its members would pull out of pickets that have helped to keep staffing of prisons below normal.
The leader of the Force Ouvriere union, which has taken the hardest line, said there would be no let-up in the protests even if wardens were punished and their pay was docked for flouting a ban on strikes in the prison service.
The wardens demand for higher starting salaries would cost France about 80 million euros a year, the FO's Emmanuel Baudin said. ""That's nothing,"" he said in an interview on CNews TV.
That compares to a government offer worth 30 million euros from Belloubet, whose hands look tied by Macron's promise to keep a lid on public expenditure.
Ombudsman Hazan warned that paralysis could lead to an uprising in prisons, where three and sometimes four inmates share small cells.
The police, who have been sent in to replace wardens in some sites, were there to maintain security not tend to prisoners' everyday needs she said.
""You can't leave inmates without the means to keep clean, take showers, eat and see their families,"" she said.

Many prisoners were simply confined to their cells and unable to get out for a prison-yard walk, she said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Five Western and Arab states that have backed the rebellion against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad make no reference to his future in a document proposing changes to U.N.-led talks, an apparent recognition of his strong position in the conflict.
The document drawn up by the United States, Jordan, Britain, France and Saudi Arabia made recommendations to the U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura for what they called a ""practical approach"" to what would be a ""slow"" political process. 
It leaked on Friday as the latest round of U.N.-led talks was underway in Vienna, and its authenticity was confirmed to Reuters by three diplomatic sources. 
The Syrian government's negotiator at the Vienna talks dismissed the proposals as ""totally unacceptable"". A Syrian opposition official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said it was ""not good"", declining to explain why.
Assad appears unassailable in the conflict thanks to direct military intervention by Iran and Russia, which is now seen as the pivotal foreign power in the war and is due to host a Syrian peace congress in Sochi next week. 
The five states' proposals recommend that de Misutra focus the parties on reforming the constitution, on holding U.N.-supervised elections for Syrians inside and outside the country, and creating a ""safe and neutral environment"" for the vote.
""All external supporters of the political process should encourage the opposition and government delegations to engage genuinely in the talks, focus squarely on these topics and, at least initially, set aside other issues,"" it said. 
While not addressing Assad's fate, the proposals call for a new constitution that would dilute presidential powers in favor of a stronger parliament. 
It also calls for the departure of all foreign militias - an apparent reference to the Iran-backed Shi'ite groups that have provided critical support to Assad - before elections.
A European diplomat confirmed the paper had been presented to de Mistura.
The United Nations has sponsored eight rounds of fruitless peace talks in Geneva since the war began in 2011, a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands and driven millions from their homes while dragging in world and regional powers.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a Jan. 17 speech called for “patience” on Assad’s departure, another acknowledgement that Russian and Iranian backing for Assad means he is unlikely to leave power soon.

The charges filed earlier this month are for crimes prosecutors have said occurred in Canada after Boyle and his family returned to the country in October 2016. Boyle and his American wife, Caitlan Coleman, were kidnapped in October 2012 while backpacking in Afghanistan.
The specifics of the accusations against Boyle have not been made public. The court has imposed a publication ban that prevents media from reporting on information that could identify any victims or witnesses.
Boyle, 34, now faces 19 charges, his lawyer Lawrence Greenspon said, four more than previously. Details on the additional charges were not immediately available from the court.
The original charges included eight counts of assault, two counts of sexual assault, two counts of forcible confinement and one count of uttering death threats.
Boyle will be sent to an in-patient facility south of Ottawa as soon as a bed is available and will be evaluated for possible treatment, Greenspon told reporters outside the court.
When Boyle and his wife returned to Canada with their three children born in captivity, Boyle said a fourth child had been murdered and his spouse raped after their capture by the Taliban-allied Haqqani network. The Taliban denied the accusations of rape and murder. [nL2N1MP02P][nL4N1MQ07B]

At the event, taking place during the World Economic Forum in Davos, leaders of Europe's top industrial, oil, healthcare and tech groups all rushed to briefly describe their activities in the United States in hope of a favorable response.
Sitting to Trump's left, Joe Kaeser, chief executive of German industrials group Siemens, kicked things off by saying that company was doing well in the United States, where it employs 56,000 workers.

Responding to comments from Werner Baumann, CEO of Bayer (DE:BAYGN) which is currently in the process of taking over U.S. seed maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), Trump said he was a regular user of one of the German healthcare group's mainstays: aspirin.
""I take one a day ... So far, it's been working,"" he told his guests, also including the CEOs of SAP and Total, who were treated to a meal of grilled beef tenderloin with green pea puree or fried Swiss pike perch with purple carrot puree.
Trump has left numerous foreign companies uneasy in light of his 'America First' agenda, which includes recently announced import duties on solar cells, a threat to end the North American Free Trade Agreement and possible tariffs on steel.
Despite this, European blue-chips continue to invest, produce and create jobs in the world's biggest economy.

636,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",EU and UK negotiators eye accelerated Brexit transition talks,"By Peter Maushagen and Alastair Macdonald
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Brexit negotiators are expected to launch fortnightly rounds of talks in Brussels from as early as next week with the aim of agreeing a swift deal on a transition period, EU diplomats said on Friday.
Brexit Secretary David Davis said in a speech outlining his view of a post-Brexit transition that was close to the status quo proposed by the EU that he expected to start talks in the coming ""days and weeks"".
The EU negotiating team led by Michel Barnier will, EU sources said, be ready to receive Davis and his officials for formal negotiations on what will happen after Britain leaves in March 2019 once EU ministers formally endorse Barnier's binding instructions at a meeting in Brussels on Monday.
A first meeting could be held as soon as the latter part of next week, they said.
While no schedule for those talks has been formally agreed, EU diplomats said the plan for now is to set a relatively fast pace of exchanges, meeting in Brussels every two weeks in contrast to the roughly monthly round of negotiations held in the first phase of the process last year. 
Davis said that, because there was broad agreement already, he was confident of reaching an interim accord on the transition by the time EU leaders hold a Brussels summit on March 22-23.
That will not be legally binding -- details of the transition will form part of a withdrawal treaty which will be agreed only by around October and legally ratified by parliaments on both sides only in the months after that.
However, both sides hope that a joint declaration on the nature of the transition in March can give businesses and people some more certainty to make decisions about their future.
The EU has proposed that Britain effectively remain in all of its existing structures, including the single market and customs union, until the end of 2020 while losing its say on EU policy. Prime Minister Theresa May appears ready to accept that, assuring disappointed Brexit supporters who say it will turn Britain into a ""vassal state"" that it is just for a short time.
Negotiations are likely to focus on the complexities of that status quo, including giving Britain a non-voting seat at some EU meetings, how to determine current matters like annual fishing quotas and how the EU might allow London to sign up to new trade deals with other countries while bound by EU accords.
The other 27 member states have also agreed to consider an extension to the transition period if more time is needed to conclude the free trade accord, which both sides say they want to have in place and working by January 2021.

Talks on that trade deal should start after EU leaders agree in March on new instructions for their negotiators.

638,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",Time up for summer? Finns push EU to scrap clock changes,"HELSINKI/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - From the depths of its northern winter darkness, Finland called on the European Union on Friday to scrap summer -- or at least the EU's twice-yearly switch of clocks to daylight saving time.
In Brussels, however, the EU executive showed little sign of haste to comply, confirming only that a long-term review of its 2001 Summer Time Directive was still going on.
A study for the European Commission in 2014 found the overwhelming majority of member states were happy with the current arrangements.
The problem is that in Helsinki, most northerly of the EU's national capitals there is less than six hours of daylight in late December. So politicians have argued that moving clocks forward and back by an hour in March and October has disrupted sleep and work and could cause long-term health problems.
The country's EU ministerial committee discussed the matter on Friday and Transport Minister Anne Berner tweeted: ""The government has decided to propose abolition of daylight saving.
""Our objective is to abandon the changing of clocks uniformly within the EU. Member states should jointly agree whether to move permanently to winter or to summer time.""
Like neighbors across the Baltic, Finland also shares an inconvenience of the time difference changing at its borders with non-EU Russia, Belarus and Ukraine -- they all gave up daylight saving after a decision taken by Moscow in 2011. 
The practice gained popularity in many countries during the energy crises of the 1970s as a means of saving power and money by effectively shifting daylight from the sleepy early hours to the busy evening.
To end variations in when clocks changed, the EU standardized a policy in the 1990s by which all member states now must move clocks an hour forward at 0100 GMT on the last Sunday in March and an hour back on the last Sunday in October. 
A Commission spokesman declined to speculate on how quickly the EU executive might act on the Finnish request: ""This is a complex issue,"" Enrico Brivio told reporters. 
""The Commission is currently examining the summer time question based on all available evidence.""

Pressed again, he replied: ""I can sing you 'Summer Time'.""

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanian Prime Minister-designate Viorica Dancila announced on Friday the creation of a new ministry to handle European Union funds and nominated as its head a lawmaker whom anti-corruption prosecutors have tried to investigate.
Dancila's move may annoy some Romanians, who have protested in their tens of thousands over the past year against official corruption, and fuel renewed concerns in the EU about Bucharest's commitment to tackling graft.
Dancila's cabinet, Romania's third in just a year, will be mainly judged by voters and investors by its ability to tackle high-level corruption, political analysts say.
""We're changing the government's structure. For me it's important to relaunch the European dimension of it,"" Dancila said after a meeting of the executive committee of the ruling Social Democrats (PSD).
Dancila said she would keep a third of the outgoing government in place. It is expected to easily win a vote of confidence on Monday given the PSD's big parliamentary majority.
The EU funds portfolio had previously been a branch of the regional development ministry and until last October was led by PSD lawmaker Rovana Plumb, the woman now nominated to head the new EU funds ministry.
Romanian anti-corruption prosecutors asked parliament last September to allow a criminal investigation into Plumb over a land transfer case also involving former development minister Sevil Shhaideh. Parliament rejected that request.
Both Plumb and Shhaideh denied any wrongdoing, but the then-prime minister sacked them in a reshuffle saying the corruption allegations were damaging Romania's relations with the EU.
GRAFT CONCERNS
Parliament has several times rejected prosecutors' requests to question lawmakers without providing any clear legal reasons. Brussels has often criticized Romania's parliament for this.
Transparency International ranks Romania among the EU's most corrupt states, though Brussels has also praised the efforts of anti-graft magistrates to bring offenders to justice. 
The EU on Wednesday urged the Romanian parliament to reconsider recent judicial reforms, which critics say weaken judicial independence.
Romania, which joined the EU in 2007, wants to improve its administrative capacity to ensure it can spend more of the EU funds to which it is entitled. In the current 2014-20 budgetary cycle it has tapped less than 3 percent of the 22.5 billion euros allocated to it due to EU red tape and lack of expertise.
Romania and other ex-communist EU member states are net beneficiaries of the bloc's multi-year budget, receiving funds to build roads and other infrastructure and for their farmers.

The attack occurred on Thursday near the small town of Diouloulou in the southern Casamance region, one of the poorest in Senegal though popular with tourists for its tropical forests and sandy beaches, the colonel told Reuters by telephone.
The Spanish Embassy in Senegal confirmed that four tourists were assaulted in Casamance but did not comment on the rape report. Spain's Foreign Ministry said it was offering consular assistance to a group of Spanish nationals in Senegal.
It was the second violent incident in Casamance this year, raising concerns that worsening security there might damage one of Senegal's main tourist attractions.
The Spanish group was traveling in a hired vehicle with a Senegalese driver. An armed band stopped and hijacked their car, then seized over 4,000 euros ($4,971.20) in cash and raped two women on the roadside before fleeing, according to the colonel, speaking on condition of anonymity.
He said the Senegalese army was searching for the attackers.
Earlier this month, unidentified gunmen in Casamance attacked a group of civilians searching for firewood, killing 14 and wounding several others. The motives for the shooting remain unknown, and the army has since been deployed into the area to investigate.

ISLAMABAD/WARSAW (Reuters) - Efforts to rescue a Polish man and a French woman stuck on a treacherous peak in northern Pakistan known to mountaineers as ""Killer Mountain"" are set to begin on Saturday, officials said.
Tomasz Mackiewicz from Poland and Elisabeth Revol of France were attempting to ascend 8,126 metre (26,660 feet) Nanga Parbat in Pakistan's Himalaya mountain range. 
Four members from a team of Polish climbers attempting the first winter summit of nearby K2, the world's second highest mountain, will assist in the rescue operation after a Pakistan Army helicopter picks them up from their base camp and flies them to Nanga Parbat.
""They will be brought from K2 to Nanga Parbat and then the operation will begin,"" Asghar Porik of Jasmine Tours told Reuters on Friday. 
Mackiewicz and Revol got stuck at the 7,400 meter mark from where they used a satellite phone to call for help, spokesman for the Alpine Club of Pakistan Karrar Haidri told Reuters. 
""We have no contact now with Tomasz,"" said Janusz Majer, who helped prepare the Polish expedition team currently scaling K2, adding that messages sent by Revol said Mackiewicz was suffering from snow blindness and frostbite. 
""We do not know in what condition he is in. He hid himself in a crevasse to seek protection from wind. Tomasz in the past has spent a couple of nights above 7,000 metres, but with all the needed equipment ... Now he has no tent,"" Majer said. 
Mackiewicz has made six previous attempts to scale Nanga Parbat in winter. The first successful winter ascent of the mountain was made as recently as February 2016.
A GoFundMe web page set up to raise the estimated 50,000 euros ($62,000)required to pay for the rescue operation costs reached its target in four hours. 
Pakistan rivals Nepal for the number of peaks over 7,000 meters (23,000 feet).
Iqbal Hussain, the head of the tourism department for Pakistan's Gilgit region, where Nanga Parbat is located, told Reuters that the rescue operation would begin on Saturday. 
The Polish foreign ministry said on Twitter that it would assist with the rescue operation, and ""on the ground efforts are being coordinated by the Polish Embassy in Islamabad"".
In June a Spanish man and an Argentinian perished in an avalanche while trying to scale Nanga Parbat.

ROME (Reuters) - The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement said on Friday that if it wins power at Italy's March 4 election it will respect the European Union's budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product, reversing an earlier stance.
5-Star's leader Luigi Di Maio had repeatedly said the party would exceed the 3 percent limit to fund public investments.
Five-star said on its website that even with 10-15 billion euros of deficit spending per year, it would remain ""comfortably below the antiquated and stupid 3 percent level"".
A 5-Star spokesman confirmed this meant they no longer planned to exceed 3 percent.
5-Star is Italy's most popular party, according to opinion polls, but it is not expected to win enough seats to form a government alone.
The maverick party has steadily moved away from unorthodox economic positions in a bid to reassure investors and Italy's partners that it can be trusted with power.
Di Maio had already backtracked on a pledge to hold a referendum on Italy's membership of the euro zone. 
The latest shift on the deficit brings 5-Star broadly into line with the positions of two of its main rivals at the election.
Centre-right leader Silvio Berlusconi and Matteo Renzi, leader of the ruling Democratic Party, have both said they
would not exceed the 3 percent limit, but Renzi has said he wants to raise it to 2.9 percent for the next five years.
However, the EU's Stability Pact does not only require Italy to hold the deficit below 3 percent, but to reduce it steadily towards a balanced budget.
The outgoing center-left government has targeted the deficit to fall from 2.1 percent in 2017 to 1.6 percent this year and 0.9 percent in 2019. 
The European Commission says even these objectives are not ambitious enough in view of Italy's huge public debt - the highest in the euro zone after Greece's - and says supplementary deficit cuts may be needed for this year.
5-Star leads the polls with around 28 percent of voting support, 5 points ahead of the PD.

A center-right alliance of smaller parties, led by Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) totals about 37 percent and is seen winning most seats but probably not enough for a working majority, meaning a hung parliament looks likely.

The pro-Maduro Supreme Court's move late on Thursday to exclude the coalition from registering in the vote placed yet another obstacle ahead of the already disparate opposition.
The vote is due by April 30, however, the opposition's most popular leaders, Leopoldo Lopez and Henrique Capriles, are already banned from standing.
Critics say Maduro is depriving Venezuelans of a free and fair election during an unprecedented economic implosion. 
""This demonstrates the fear felt by Maduro of the people,"" opposition lawmaker Stalin Gonzalez said on Thursday.
International pressure is also piling on the government. The United States said this week that the vote will ""deepen, not help resolve, national tensions,"" and Vice President Mike Pence called Maduro a ""dictator.""
Thursday's ruling said the coalition violated the principle of avoiding ""double affiliation"" in politics and therefore could not be validated. 
Critics see that as baseless, and the opposition is discussing its next move. 
""If the opposition opts to participate, it risks legitimizing (an election) process that has already been questioned by the international community,"" said IHS analyst Diego Moya-Ocampos.

""However, if the opposition chooses not to contest the elections, Maduro will be enabled to straightforwardly extend his mandate for a new six-year presidential term.""

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Authorities in Ethiopia's restive Oromiya province have pardoned over 2,000 prisoners jailed for involvement in unrest that gripped the country in 2015-2016, officials said on Friday.
The move is part of government efforts to calm unrest that has lingered since mass protests broke out in the region over accusations of land grabbing.
Hundreds have died in the violence, with protests broadening into demonstrations against political restrictions and perceived human rights abuses.
On Friday, Oromiya regional President Lema Megersa announced that 2,345 inmates had been pardoned, of whom 1,568 had already been convicted and sentenced.
The move followed the release of Merera Gudina, an opposition leader who was arrested on his return from Brussels where he had addressed members of the European Parliament on the violence in Oromiya. He was freed alongside 114 other inmates.
The government in Addis Ababa has long been accused by rights groups of using security concerns as an excuse to stifle dissent and media freedoms. It denies the charges.
Last week the United Nations urged the Horn of Africa country to review the status of a ""large number of people"" still behind bars. 
U.N. human rights spokesman Liz Throssell said the Addis Ababa government should review anti-terror legislation and laws ""to ensure that they are neither interpreted nor implemented too broadly, thereby resulting in people being arbitrarily or wrongfully detained"".
Laws placing ""undue restrictions"" on non-governmental organizations and restricting the media should also be revised, Throssell told a news conference in Geneva earlier this week.

The man, named as Amaechi Fred O., was detained on Wednesday in Bavaria and a day later a judge issued an arrest warrant and ordered that he be remanded in custody, the chief federal prosecutor said in a statement.
""He is strongly suspected of being a member of the foreign terrorist organization Boko Haram,"" the statement said.
It said Amaechi Fred O. was believed to have joined Boko Haram in 2013 and had admitted to actively taking part in four attacks against Nigerian civilians during his one-year membership of the group.
He is accused of killing several people during two attacks on schools and one attack on a village and taking part in another attack on a village, during which members of Boko Haram took girls as hostages and burned down a church.
Boko Haram has been trying since 2009 to establish an Islamic state in northeast Nigeria, from where it has launched attacks and suicide bombings in Niger, Chad and Cameroon. More than 15,000 people have been killed and millions displaced.

647,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 09:26AM ET</span>",Parties aim to wrap up German coalition talks by next weekend,"By Andreas Rinke and Michelle Martin
BERLIN (Reuters) - Negotiators thrashing out a new coalition deal between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) aim to wrap up talks by next weekend, in a sign Germany's months-long political limbo could be nearing an end.
In a joint statement made after the first morning of formal coalition talks on Friday, the parties said expert groups would aim to assemble a concrete governing program for Europe's largest economy within seven days.
""From Friday to Sunday (next week), top negotiators will meet with the aim of finalizing the negotiations,"" they said, adding that they were making room for two further days of the highly sensitive talks in case of timetable slippage.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives opened coalition talks with their Social Democrat (SPD) partners on Friday, promising swift progress in negotiations aimed at ending four months of political limbo in Europe's largest economy.
Four months after a national election that returned a fragmented German parliament, the tight timetable is an indication parties are anxious to bring an end to a period of rudderlessness that critics say has fueled the far-right.
""People expect us to move towards forming a government and that's why I'm very optimistic and very determined,"" said Merkel on arrival at the talks on Friday morning. The talks are her best hope of securing a fourth term after the failure of an earlier attempt to form a three-way coalition.
While most experts expect talks to succeed, many in the SPD are reluctant, seeing a repeat coalition as at best a painful sacrifice by their party for the sake of stability in Europe's economic and political behemoth.
Appealing to them, leader Martin Schulz stressed their party's global responsibility.
""Given the challenges from China and the U.S., the European Union needs a strong, pro-European Germany,"" he said. ""And that you will only get if the SPD is in government.""
CONFLICTS
But Stephan Weil, SPD premier of the state of Lower Saxony, said the party must define itself more clearly against the conservatives in any future coalition with Merkel, promising a more tempestuous approach.
""The SPD has to become sharper, more critical and more willing to take on conflicts than it has been,"" he told news magazine Der Spiegel.
Underlining the stakes for the SPD, one of two main parties that dominated post-war German history, a poll for ARD television showed only 19 percent would vote for it in repeat elections, placing it just seven points ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Riven by division over whether it would not be better to rebuild in opposition, the SPD's leadership is under pressure from its radical youth wing to win concessions from the conservatives, on immigration in particular.
But the conservatives also want to stand their ground to defend their right flank from the AfD, which burst into parliament for the first time on Sept. 24, propelled by public concerns over Merkel's decision to open Germany's doors to more than a million refugees in 2015.
In a draft agreement the two camps hammered out this month, the parties agreed a soft ceiling of 220,000 immigrants a year, one the Christian Social Union (CSU), arch-conservative Bavarian sister party to Merkel's CDU, refuses to compromise on.
Senior SPD member Democrat Andrea Nahles told broadcaster ARD her party would push for worker-friendly social justice measures like eliminating many fixed-term contracts and improving conditions for citizens who pay into the public rather than private healthcare system.

But time presses. The SPD membership has been promised a vote on a final coalition deal. With new members thronging to the party in the hope of casting a vote against a new coalition, chances of securing membership consent diminish by the day.

The resignation of Fumiaki Matsumoto, deputy minister of the Cabinet Office, will likely give Abe a fresh headache as the scandal comes ahead of a key mayoral election in Okinawa.
When an opposition lawmaker asked Abe in Thursday's parliamentary session about a recent series of emergency landings by U.S. military helicopters in Okinawa, Matsumoto heckled by saying, ""How many people died from that?"" Kyodo news agency said.
Matsumoto on Friday tendered a letter of resignation, which Abe accepted, Kyodo said. No one was immediately available for comment at Matsumoto's office or at the Cabinet Office. 
In the Feb. 4 election in the city of Nago, incumbent Susumu Inamine, a staunch opponent of a plan to move the U.S. Marines' Futenma airbase, located in another part of the island, to his city, is set to fight a candidate supported by Abe's Liberal Democratic Party. 
Abe's government and Okinawa authorities have been at loggerheads for years over the relocation plan as resentment has simmered among residents who say they bear an unfair burden in supporting the U.S. military presence in Japan.
Many Okinawa residents associate the U.S. military presence with crime, pollution and accidents. A window fell from a U.S. helicopter onto a school sports field on the island last month, fanning safety concerns. 
This is not the first time Abe has seen his minister resigning over missteps. 
Last July, Tomomi Inada stepped down as defense minister after a series of gaffes and a cover-up at her ministry that contributed to a plunge in public support for the prime minister. But his support bounced back after a cabinet reshuffle in August.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's government on Friday decided to ask the Constitutional Court to block former leader Carles Puigdemont's bid to lead Catalonia again, the deputy prime minister said.
Puigdemont fled to Belgium shortly after declaring Catalonia independent from Spain in October, a move considered illegal under Spanish law. He faces charges including rebellion and sedition if he returns to Spain but he is the separatists' candidate to lead the region.
The row over Puigdemont's candidacy will come to a head on Tuesday when the Catalan parliament plans to vote on it.
""The government must use every tool made available by the laws and the constitution to make sure that a fugitive cannot be sworn in and become the head of the regional government,"" deputy prime minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said after announcing the appeal to Spain's top court.
Puigdemont reacted immediately. ""They are panicking in the face of the will of the people,"" he said on Twitter. 
The newly elected speaker of the Catalan parliament, Roger Torrent, nominated Puigdemont on Monday as the sole candidate for regional leader, against warnings by Madrid that he couldn't take the position. 
Puigdemont has not ruled out travelling to Barcelona to take part in the parliamentary vote but has not said he would do it either. 

The government's decision to appeal directly to the constitutional court comes after the Council of State - the supreme consultative council of the Spanish government which advises on serious issues - advised against it on Thursday.

LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - The Philippines is bracing for a possible three-month-long emergency in areas around an erupting volcano, which has already displaced more than 81,000 and led to overcrowded temporary shelters, the disaster agency said on Friday.
Mount Mayon in central Albay province remained at alert level 4, a notch below the highest level, as it continued to spew lava, ash and other superheated material, volcanologists said.
""We're gearing up for three months"" of emergency, said Romina Marasigan, spokeswoman of the country's disaster agency, citing similar situations during previous eruptions of the 2,462-metre (8,077-foot) volcano.
(Graphic: Mayon volcano's 9-km radius danger zone - http://tmsnrt.rs/2E1X3bI) 
Displaced families may need to stay in evacuation centres for that long, she said.
Food and other supplies remain adequate but concerns are growing over health and hygiene conditions at all the 69 temporary shelters away from the danger zone.
Respiratory illnesses are possible because of the series of ash falls, she said.
""We remain on red alert,"" Marasigan told a media briefing, adding that 69,672 evacuees were housed in schools while nearly 12,000 took shelter in tents or went to relatives in more secure locations.
Health workers are giving free check-ups and medicine to elderly women and children in evacuation centres grappling with a sanitation shortage.
""The province is doing everything to close the gaps for these toilet facilities,"" said Nestor Santiago, assistant secretary at the health ministry.
The number of cancelled flights has risen to 97, the disaster agency said.
Volcanologists said there were seven more episodes of intense but sporadic lava fountaining at the crater lasting several minutes during a 21-hour period from Thursday morning.
The lava fountains, shooting up between 150 m. (492 ft) and 500 m. (1,640 ft), generated ash plumes that spurted as high as 3 km (1.8 miles) above the crater, they said.
Despite the warnings, some residents have refused to abandon the danger zone, with farmers worrying about leaving crops and cattle unattended, while others split their time between homes and evacuation centres they say are crowded and uncomfortable.
Mayla Miraflor has a vehicle loaded and ready to flee if Mayon rages unchecked.

""We have this jeep when we need to run,"" said Miraflor, who has eight children. ""This is what we'll use when the time comes. We will leave as soon as possible.""

653,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>","Moscow, markets ready for possible fresh U.S. sanctions","By Jack Stubbs, Simon Jessop and Sujata Rao
MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - The United States could release reports as early as Monday detailing the possibilities for expanding sanctions against Russia, including a list of prominent oligarchs and potential restrictions on the holding of Russian government debt. 
The reports are part of a sanctions bill passed overwhelmingly by Congress soon after U.S. President Donald Trump took office and signed by him in August last year, despite campaign pledges to improve ties with Russia.
WHAT ARE THE SANCTIONS?
The Aug. 2 sanctions bill expands and toughens those already in force against Russia in response to its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, and support for separatist rebels fighting in the east of the country.
It is intended to further punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, an accusation the Kremlin has repeatedly denied.
The bill requires the U.S. Treasury Department to prepare a list of the most significant Russian oligarchs ""as determined by their closeness to the Russian regime and their net worth"". 
This will be accompanied by a report ""describing in detail the potential effects of expanding sanctions ... to include sovereign debt and the full range of derivative products.""
Both reports are due to be sent to Congress by the end of January, weeks before Russia is due to vote in a presidential election which Vladimir Putin is widely expected to win. 
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES?
While inclusion on the new list of individuals would not automatically lead to immediate sanctions, some members of Russia's business elite have said being named is a major concern because the criteria and consequences are unclear.
If sanctions are tightened later, based on the list due next week, this could prevent some of the Kremlin's closest allies from traveling abroad or accessing foreign bank accounts. It may also trigger a freeze of foreign assets and make foreign politicians, banks and officials reluctant to have dealings with them. 
Such risks have already prompted some of Russia's wealthiest people to distance themselves from Putin.
Expanding sanctions to cover debt and derivative products issued by the Russian government could impose restrictions on buying Russian treasury bonds, known as OFZs.
Rouble-denominated OFZ bonds are popular with international investors because of their lucrative yields. Foreign investors held 2.2 trillion rubles ($39 billion) of OFZs as of Dec. 1 last year.
Russian officials have played down the possible consequences of sanctioning OFZs and other debt instruments, but doing so could make it harder for the government to cover its budget deficit at a time when the economy is still fragile as a result of a two-year economic downturn.
HOW ARE MARKETS REACTING?
The country's economic malaise, multiple bank bail-outs and concerns about fresh sanctions weighed on the relative performance of Russia's main stock market last year, although a recovering oil price has helped cushion the impact.
With key export crude oil hitting 3-year highs in recent weeks both the rouble and Russian stocks have risen - the main MOEX index is at a record high - although some say sanctions worries have still hampered gains.
Demand for its high-yielding sovereign debt has remained consistently strong. At the end of December, foreigners held 32.1 percent of issued debt, just off the record high of 33.2 percent hit in October.
Analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) say U.S. curbs on bond buying would lead to ""material"" pressure, although they - like most investors - consider it unlikely.
In defensive mode since the first round of sanctions, many Russian firms are sitting on healthier cash piles this time or have gone into the market to raise more, suggesting the broad-market impact of further sanctions could be more muted.
Russian companies raised around $8 billion via share sales in 2017, more than double the amount raised in the prior year.
They have also been active on the debt markets, raising as much as $2 billion through Eurobond issues in the first weeks of 2018 already, while others have looked to firm up lines of credit with their banks.
On Thursday, Norilsk Nickel said it had agreed fresh credit lines with several Russian banks in case sanctions contribute to any worsening of its business outlook.
WHAT ARE INVESTORS SAYING?
A number of international investors said their working assumption is that the reports provide fresh information on already sanctioned individuals and suggest others to be included.
As such, few expect a sustained market-wide sell-off of Russian assets. The bigger risk is seen as stock-specific and depends on the names added and their corporate connections.
Even if fresh sanctions are not imposed, some are concerned the names form a 'grey list' to be avoided in case they are sanctioned later, potentially crimping business anyway.
""A lot of companies are either state-run or owned by private individuals that's why we have deliberately reduced exposure and only invest in companies that don't face these risks,"" said Richard Farrell, Portfolio Manager of Emerging Market Equities at Royal Bank of Canada Global Asset Management.
While some have trimmed exposure to Russian assets, others are waiting to see exactly what form the sanctions take - and how the Kremlin responds - before acting.

""Without knowing ... it is very difficult to take any measures or speculate about a potential impact on the investment risk,"" Swedbank Robur Russia Fund, Elena Lovén said.

Egypt's mission to the U.N. in Geneva did not immediately comment on the appeal. 
“We have raised multiple specific cases with the Egyptian authorities and continue to receive more. In the light of these persistent serious allegations, we urge the Government to halt all pending executions,"" the experts said in a statement.
“The authorities should ensure that all death sentences are reviewed and, where convictions were based on unfair trials, ensure that individuals have retrials during which Egypt’s human rights obligations are fully respected.”
An Islamic State insurgency in North Sinai has expanded to include civilian targets in the past year. Egypt this month renewed its state of emergency for three more months, broadening the power of authorities to crack down on what it calls enemies of the state.
The five experts who issued the statement, special rapporteurs reporting to the U.N. Human Rights Council, said capital punishment should be used only for the most serious crimes and after a legal process with all legal safeguards. 
The experts were José Antonio Guevara Bermúdez, Agnes Callamard, Bernard Duhaime, Nils Melzer, and Fionnuala D. Ní Aoláin, who report to the Council on arbitrary detention, extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, torture and the protection of human rights while countering terrorism.

BELGRADE/ZAGREB (Reuters) - Croatia accused Serbia on Friday of falsifying history for propaganda purposes with its Holocaust exhibit at the United Nations in New York on a World War Two extermination camp run by Croatia's then fascist regime.
Serbia and Croatia are the two biggest republics to emerge from Yugoslavia, which collapsed in 1991. They have sought to improve ties since a 1991-1995 war but relations remain sour.
The exhibit was prepared without the participation of Croatia's Jasenovac Memorial Centre, said Croatia's Foreign Minister Marija Pejcinovic Buric.
""We express deep respect for all the victims of the Ustasha regime and in the strongest possible terms we condemn all its crimes and particularly crimes committed in the Jasenovac camp,"" a foreign ministry statement said.
""Because of the respect for the victims, we consider it utterly unacceptable to use the suffering in Jasenovac for propaganda purposes or the goals of daily politics,"" it said.
The exhibition was set up to commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Jan. 27 and is sponsored by Serbia's Permanent Mission to the United Nations, said Serbia's Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic.
""Jasenovac is perhaps the foremost example in Europe of the bestiality of killing ... even Nazis were horrified,"" Serbia's Tanjug news agency quoted Dacic as saying.
The exhibition, called Jasenovac - The Right Not to Forget, ""represents a modest contribution to ... global efforts of the UN in order to prevent the onset of the revision and rehabilitation of neo-Nazi and neo-fascist ideologies,"" he said.
The United Nations said organizers were responsible for the content of the exhibition and staging it at headquarters did not imply the U.N. acceptance of those contents.
The Jasenovac camp was operated from 1941 until 1945 by the Independent State of Croatia, a puppet state ruled by the Ustasha regime and allied to the Nazis. Serbs, Jews, Roma and Croats who opposed the regime were imprisoned and killed there.
Some Croatian historians say between 80,000 and 100,000 people died at Jasenovac. Some Serb historians say the number is around 600,000. Other historians have given both higher and lower figures.
Starting in 1941, the Ustasha regime sought to purge Croatia of Serbs who are predominantly Orthodox Christian, Jews, Roma and anyone who opposed their rule including supporters of Josip Broz Tito's communist partisans, who eventually took power.
The Nazi Holocaust featured industrialized killing and gas chambers. Prisoners in Ustasha camps were frequently stabbed or bludgeoned to death and there were competitions between guards to see who could kill the most people.

""While precise figures are unavailable because of very limited official health or nutrition data, there are clear signs that the crisis is limiting children’s access to quality health services, medicines and food,"" UNICEF spokesman Christophe Boulierac told a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva.
Venezuela's government has not published data on wasting - a low weight to height ratio in children under five - since 2009, when the figure was 3.2 percent. Aid agency Caritas put the figure at 15.5 percent last August, UNICEF said.
“When it’s about fighting child malnutrition, it’s not a time for discussing, it’s time for action,"" Boulierac said. ""Acting to fight malnutrition requires data, and there’s not enough official data right now and there’s not enough coordination.”
He said he had no information to suggest that UNICEF was being prevented from doing its work, and it was not uncommon to have a lack of data. 
The government of President Nicolas Maduro says Venezuela is fighting a U.S.-led right-wing conspiracy determined to end socialism in Latin America, hobble Venezuela's economy, and steal its oil wealth.
But critics say Maduro, who succeeded Hugo Chavez in 2013 and said this week he was standing for re-election, has ruined a once prosperous oil economy, turned Venezuela into a dictatorship and skewed the election system to perpetuate power for his Socialist Party. [nL2N1PJ14H]
UNICEF said the government had taken steps to mitigate the impact of the crisis on children, by providing affordable food packages to the most vulnerable families, cash transfers, and strengthening nutritional assessment and recuperation services. 
But Boulierac said that without concerted action between the government, aid agencies and the U.N., efforts to tackle malnutrition would be ineffective. 
""It’s a situation where there is an economic crisis, hyperinflation, sky-rocketing prices, and it’s also a socio-political crisis with a lack of agreement, dialogue, to solve the most urgent issues.""

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he had not intended to cause offense in Britain by sharing anti-Muslim videos originally posted by a leader of a far-right fringe group, and that he would apologize if such people were horrible racists.
Trump told ITV's Good Morning Britain show he knew nothing about the group but that he was the ""least racist person that anybody's going to meet"" and that his retweet was not an endorsement.
Trump sparked outrage in Britain when he shared the anti-Muslim videos last November and became embroiled in a public spat with British PM Theresa May who criticized him for the retweet. 
When pressed on whether he would apologize for his retweet, Trump said that if the group was made up of racists then he would.
""Here's what's fair, if you're telling me they're horrible people, horrible racist people, I would certainly apologize if you would like me to do that,"" Trump said.
""I know nothing about them. I don’t want to be involved with (these) people, but you're telling me about these people because I know nothing about these people.""
Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of anti-immigration Britain First, posted the videos which she said showed a group of people who were Muslims beating a teenage boy to death, battering a boy on crutches and destroying a Christian statue.
Fransen on Friday said believed Trump had been ""railroaded"" into making an apology and said it was she who was due an apology for being described as a racist.
MILITANT ATTACKS 
""The British establishment is trying to censor the president of the United States,"" she told journalists after a court appearance in Belfast related to allegations that a speech she made about Muslims was ""intended or likely to stir up hatred"".
Relations between the two nations, described as ""the special relationship"", have faced several ups and downs not just due to Trump's criticism of May, but also his spats with London Mayor Sadiq Khan and his comments on militant attacks in Britain. 
Earlier this month, he canceled a trip to London to open a new embassy, saying he did not want to endorse a bad deal agreed by the Obama administration to sell the old one for ""peanuts"". 
Some Britons are angry at the prospect of a visit by Trump with large protests expected when he does arrive, most probably in the second half of the year according to a senior British government source.
Officials are discussing whether Trump will be given a state visit, which means he will be hosted by Queen Elizabeth, and when exactly it will take place, the source said.
In the interview aired on Friday, Trump said he loved Britain very much and got along well with May. 
""I can tell you I have a very good relationship with your Prime Minister,"" Trump said. ""She's been doing a very good job. We actually have a very good relationship, although a lot of people think we don't.""

""I support her, I support a lot of what she does and a lot of what she says and I support you militarily very much. We will come to your defense if anything should happen, which hopefully will never happen. I am a tremendous supporter of the UK.""

Following high-profile attacks on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul and a compound of the Save the Children aid group in Jalalabad in recent days, the violence in Ghazni highlighted the daily toll on Afghan civilians across the country.
Provincial officials said a Taliban mortar attack struck the village while the children were outside, killing the six and wounding two.
""Children were playing in the yard of a house when the Taliban fired mortars. One hit the ground and killed six children and wounded two,"" Ghazni police chief Mohammad Zaman told reporters.
Mohammad Radmanish, a spokesman for the defense ministry, also blamed Taliban for the attack: ""We can say clearly that it was a rocket by the enemy forces."" he said.
""The person who fired the rockets was killed by our forces and we seized his rocket.""
However local people said the children died in an air strike by Afghan security forces, which have been conducting an increasing number of air operations as their fledgling air force has grown over the past year. 
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the air strike had killed seven civilians, wounded six and destroyed four houses.
A defense ministry official in Kabul said three civilians had been killed in an air strike near Ghazni but it was not clear whether they were children.
According to the latest report from the United Nations, 2,640 civilians were killed and 5,379 wounded between January and September last year, with more than a third killed in ground engagements. Armed conflict killed 689 children and wounded another 1,791 during the period.

Their case was thrown out by the emergency commission that was formed to evaluate government decisions taken as part of a security crackdown following a 2016 coup attempt. More than 150,000 people have since lost their jobs.
After going on hunger strike and staging protests against the purges, literature professor Nuriye Gulmen was arrested in May and later convicted of belonging to an outlawed militant leftist group, a charge she denies. The reasons for the firing of primary school teacher Semih Ozakca were not given.
""Today the commission rejected our appeal, but we will take it to the court. As of today we are ending our hunger strike, but our resistance will continue,"" Gulmen said.
A medical doctors group said last week Gulmen and Ozakca were experiencing serious health problems due to their diet of water, herbal tea, sugar and salt solutions.

Gulmen weighed 59 kg (130 pounds) before the strike and is now under 34 kg (75 pounds) while Ozakça has gone from 86 kg to 45 kg (189 to 100 pounds), according to the Ankara doctors' chamber.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's overcrowded prison system is on the brink of mutiny after two weeks of unrest, the jails ombudsman said on Friday, with hardline labor unions vowing no surrender in a showdown with President Emmanuel Macron's government.
The warning from the independent ombudsman follows a second fruitless attempt by Macron's justice minister to buy peace with the wardens, whose work stoppages are slowly paralyzing prisons and pushing tensions with prisoners to boiling point.
""If this crisis is not brought to an immediate end, there's no telling what will happen,"" said Adeline Hazan, who oversees conditions in France's 188 jails, which house some 70,000 convicts, one of the largest prison populations in Europe.
""The situation is extremely tense ... we're on the brink of a blowout.""
Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet, accused of reacting too slowly to frustration among wardens after a spate of attacks by inmates, defended what she called a ""significant"" offer of bonuses and improved safety measures.
The proposal, which also includes plans to isolate many Islamist militants and other religiously radicalised inmates from the rest of the prison population, was rejected by two of three labor unions on Thursday.
While Macron himself made a public declaration of confidence in Belloubet, the minister looked to be in difficulty after her proposal, the second in a week, was given short shrift.
The leader of the Force Ouvriere union, which has taken the hardest line, said there would be no let-up in the protests even if wardens were punished and their pay was docked for flouting a ban on strikes in the prison service.
Wardens want a change in their public service grade that would give them higher starting salaries, a demand that would cost around 80 million euros a year, FO's Emmanuel Baudin said. ""That's nothing,"" he said in an interview on CNews TV.
It compares to a government offer worth 30 million euros from Belloubet, whose hands look tied by Macron's promise to keep a lid on public expenditure.
She told Europe 1 radio that union divisions were making matters more difficult. While the FO and CGT unions both rejected her latest offer, she had not yet had word from UFAP-Unsa, the largest wardens' union.
The threat of an extended disruption is weighing on the government, which is broadly seen as having delivered on its promises under Prime Minister Edouard Philippe.
Hazan, the ombudsman, warned that paralysis could lead to mutiny in jails, where three and sometimes four inmates share a cell of less than 10 sq meters (yards).
She said that police, who have been sent in to replace off-work wardens in some locations, were there to maintain security, not tend to prisoners' everyday needs.

""You can't leave inmates without the means to keep clean, take showers, eat and see their families,"" she said, adding that many prisoners were simply confined to their cells and unable to get out for a prison-yard walk.

The Saudi activists had faced charges including setting up an independent organization and making statements harmful to the kingdom.
Amnesty said Otaibi and Attawi were the first human rights defenders sentenced under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman.
Otaibi was arrested at Doha airport and deported from Qatar to Saudi Arabia in May after he tried to fly with his wife to Norway where he had been granted political asylum.
The Saudi government's communications office could not be reached for comment.
Amnesty said the list of charges against them included setting up an organization before receiving authorization, spreading chaos, inciting public opinion and publishing statements harmful to the kingdom and its institutions.
It did not say how they pleaded. The sentences were handed down by a court in the capital Riyadh on Thursday.
""The harsh sentencing of Mohammad al-Otaibi and Abdullah al-Attawi, who should never have been prosecuted in the first place, confirms our fears that the new leadership of Mohamed Bin Salman is determined to silence civil society and human rights defenders in the Kingdom,"" Amnesty's Middle East director Samah Hadid said in a statement.
Crown Prince Mohammed has taken power in Western-allied Saudi Arabia, pushing a reform agenda aimed at weaning the country off oil wealth and introducing social changes.
However, New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week that more than a dozen prominent political activists convicted on ""vague charges arising from their peaceful activities"" were serving lengthy prison sentences.
Since the 2011 Arab Spring, Saudi authorities have stepped up efforts to curb dissent with tough new cybercrime laws, sentencing offenders to prison terms for online posts deemed insulting to the kingdom or threatening to public order.
An absolute monarchy, Saudi Arabia bans political parties and public forms of protest and has sentenced members of a civil rights organization who campaigned for a constitutional monarchy to decades in prison.

The raid reflects Zuma's weakened position following his replacement by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa as leader of the ruling party last month.
Zuma, whose presidency has been marred by corruption scandals, could be ousted as head of state within weeks as top party officials discuss forcing him to resign.
A spokesman for the elite 'Hawks' crime-fighting unit said police were searching for documents in the Free State premier's office and agriculture department over the Estina dairy project in the town of Vrede. 
One of the ANC's ""top six"" most powerful officials, Ace Magashule, is the outgoing premier of the Free State.
The Estina dairy received public money and was meant to benefit the local community. But prosecutors say funds were illegally diverted to bank accounts of people including Atul Gupta, a wealthy businessman.
Atul Gupta, as well as his brothers Ajay and Rajesh, is a friend of Zuma. The South African government has launched a judicial enquiry into allegations the brothers influenced the appointment of cabinet ministers.
Zuma and the Guptas have denied wrongdoing.
As part of the investigation into the dairy, prosecutors have obtained a court order freezing 220 million rand ($18.6 million) in bank accounts, a spokesman for the state prosecutors' office said. Atul Gupta was mentioned in the court order as having received the proceeds of crime.
The investigation could have important political repercussions, as it could lead to Magashule losing his job as ANC secretary general, a post that puts him in charge of the day-to-day running of the ruling party.
Ramaphosa did not want Magashule to be chosen as secretary general in December. Should Magashule end up in legal trouble over the dairy project, Ramaphosa could try to replace him with a loyalist.
Magashule said earlier this week that no person was guilty until proven in the courts.
""Wherever there is corruption, the law must take its course. ... We will treat the Vrede dairy in that way,"" he told reporters. An ANC spokeswoman was not immediately available for further comment on Friday.
The Hawks spokesman said the investigation into the Estina dairy was at an advanced stage.

LONDON (Reuters) - A British judge will rule on Feb. 6 whether to drop an arrest warrant against Julian Assange that stems from his breach of bail conditions, as the WikiLeaks founder steps up efforts to leave the Ecuadorean Embassy after more than five years. 
Assange, 46, has been holed up in the building since 2012 after skipping bail to avoid extradition to Sweden over an allegation of rape, which he denies.
Assange had feared Sweden would hand him over to the United States to face prosecution over WikiLeaks' publication of a large trove of classified military and diplomatic documents - one of the largest information leaks in U.S. history.
In May last year, Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation into the allegation. But British police have insisted Assange will still be arrested for breaching bail conditions should he leave the embassy. [nL8N1IL1OT] 
On Friday, Assange's lawyer, Mark Summers, told Westminster Magistrates' Court during the first hearing regarding the case since 2012 that the withdrawal of the European Arrest Warrant means the bail arrest warrant no longer applied. 
""We say it's lost its purpose and its function,"" he said.
When asked if a successful ruling could enable Assange to walk free, a spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS)said, ""Hypothetically yes, that would be our interpretation.""
CPS lawyer Aaron Watkins told the court it would be ""absurd"" if a defendant were to effectively rewarded for managing to evade proceedings for sufficiently long that they fell away.
To some, Assange is a cyber hero who exposed government abuses of power. To others, he is a criminal who undermined the security of the West by exposing secrets.
British police have said the charge of skipping bail is a much less serious offence than rape, but he could still face up to a year in jail if convicted. 
Ecuador said this month it had given citizenship to Assange, hours after the British government refused a request for him to be given diplomatic status, which could have given Assange immunity from arrest should he try to leave the embassy.

Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said she would make her ruling on Feb. 6.

His comments came as negotiators settled in for a long, final day at separate U.N.-mediated talks in Vienna aimed at ending Syria's civil war, in which hundreds of thousands have died and 11 million have been driven from their homes. 
The U.N.-brokered talks - of which this is the ninth round - have made little progress so far.
Having regained the upper hand on the battlefield after nearly seven years of conflict, President Bashar al-Assad appears unwilling to negotiate with his enemies at all, let alone step down as part of any peaceful solution as rebel groups have demanded.
Arriving at the U.N. offices in Vienna on Friday morning, the talks' host, U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura, told reporters he expected ""a long meeting"".
With a breakthrough unlikely, a question at the center of Friday's discussions was whether the opposition will attend a Syria peace conference next week in the Russian Black Sea resort town of Sochi, which Moscow announced after the last round of U.N. talks in December.
Western powers and some Arab states believe Sochi is an attempt to create a parallel political track that would undermine the United Nations and lay groundwork for a solution more suitable to the Damascus government and its allies.
""We will tell you today, hopefully,"" opposition spokesman Yahya Aridi told reporters as his delegation arrived, when asked if the opposition would attend Sochi.
The warring sides have not spoken face to face -- a Syrian government delegation was due to meet De Mistura in the afternoon. De Mistura was expected to make a statement at the end of the talks.
Neither side has commented on the content of this week's closed-door talks.
Previous rounds have taken place sporadically in Geneva, with a mandate to discuss new elections, reformed governance, a new constitution and the fight against terrorism.
At the last round in December, the Syrian government delegation objected to the opposition's tough line on the future of Assad, and those talks achieved nothing.

Syrian government forces are pursuing offensives against two remaining rebel pockets, Idlib in the northwest and eastern Ghouta near Damascus. Turkey has poured troops into the north to fight Kurdish militias that have established regional autonomy and are seen by Ankara as a menace to its security.

MIRYANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Once famous for an award-winning film of the same name, the South Korean city of Miryang became a scene of horror on Friday as flames and toxic smoke swept through a hospital, killing at least 37 people and injuring more than 140.
South Korea's deadliest fire in almost a decade followed one last month that killed 29 people, reviving concern over safety standards, as the hospital director said current law did not require the building to have a sprinkler system. 
""So many lives were sacrificed and the people of our city, as well as those throughout the country, have fallen into deep grief,"" the city's mayor, Park Il-ho, told reporters, appearing visibly distressed.
Many patients ""walked though fire and smoke"" to escape from the Sejong Hospital as the main exit was on the first floor, which was ablaze, a city official told Reuters.
Those on upper floors used ladders and plastic escape slides to flee, while firefighters carried some who could not walk.
""I saw the elderly patients scrambling out through the windows and had to help,"" said Woo Young-min, 25, as he stood in his pyjamas outside the hospital. 
The presidential Blue House initially said the number of dead was at least 41, but deferred to a toll of 37 from the fire chief of Miryang, which is about 270 km (170 miles) southeast of Seoul, the capital, and home to about 108,000 people.
Fire officials posted a list of at least 26 victims outside the hospital, their ages ranging from 34 to 96 years, with at least a score over 70.
Families crowded round a handwritten list of names and hospital rooms that officials had scrawled on a wall at a nearby funeral home. 
The fire broke out around 7.30 a.m. (2230 GMT) at the rear of the emergency room on the hospital's first floor, fire official Choi Man-woo told a televised news briefing. 
The street outside the hospital featured in the 2007 South Korean drama ""Miryang,"" or ""Secret Sunshine,"" which garnered awards at Cannes and other film festivals.
But on Friday, witnesses described scenes of chaos in the sub-freezing temperatures, as nearby residents rushed to take portable hotpacks to shivering victims. 
Woo said he was walking home after working a graveyard shift when he saw the fire and patients trying to escape the blaze.
""The firefighters were shouting at us not to go inside the building, so I stayed and helped others bring the patients down the slides.""
Television broadcast images of black smoke billowing from the windows and entrance of the hospital as flames flickered.
At least 177 patients - most of them elderly - were at the hospital and an adjacent nursing home when the fire broke out, hospital director Song Byeong-cheol told reporters.
Song said three of the nine hospital staff on duty at the time died, including at least one doctor, a nurse, and a nurse's aide, all killed on the second floor. 
Most of those who died were on the first and second floors, said Choi, but added that there were no deaths from burns.
Seven people were critically injured, while 126 had less serious wounds, officials told a Friday evening briefing.
The injured were treated at 14 regional hospitals.
By Friday afternoon, police had cordoned off the burnt-out hospital, as forensic investigators combed the smoke-blackened building. Charred debris and shattered glass littered the ground outside.
NO SPRINKLER SYSTEM
Asia’s fourth-largest economy, with one of the world's fastest ageing populations, South Korea has faced criticism in recent years over inadequate safety standards.
Song said the six-storey hospital did not have a sprinkler system and was not large enough to require one under the law.
The nursing home annexe, where no patients died, is covered by a new law, however, and Song said the hospital had planned to begin installing a sprinkler system there next week.
Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said the government would consider changing the law.
Interior ministry guidelines published in December 2016 suggest sprinklers for all buildings of six or more storeys.
Officials said they were still investigating the cause of the fire, but were looking at a possible short circuit in the emergency room's heating and cooling system.
""According to an initial eyewitness, fire broke out where there are two air-conditioning and heating devices in the emergency room,"" Song said.
""Others said an electric spark occurred on the ceiling of the emergency room and then fire spread quickly."" 
The hospital had regular safety inspections and was built to government standards, with fire exits and extinguishers, many of which were used during the fire, he added.
President Moon Jae-in held an emergency meeting with top aides and urged ""all necessary measures"" to help survivors.
Interior Minister Kim Boo-kyum, who visited Miryang to apologise for the fire, promised government help for victims, Yonhap news agency said.
In December, 29 people were killed in a blaze at an eight-storey fitness centre in Jecheon City, most of them women trapped in a sauna by toxic fumes. The event fed anger over reports of shoddy construction, among other shortcomings.

In 2014, a fire at a rural hospital killed 21 people, while a 2008 warehouse fire outside Seoul killed 40.

Duterte said he made the remarks in a speech at the Philippines-India Business Forum in New Delhi where Duterte and Suu Kyi are attending a summit of Southeast Asian countries.
""We were talking about our country, the interest of our country ... and I said 'do not mind the human rights' (activists), they are just a noisy bunch actually,"" Duterte said.
Suu Kyi is facing international criticism for failing to address the plight of the Rohingya, more than 655,500 of whom have fled to Bangladesh to escape a crackdown by the Myanmar military.
Many people in Buddhist-majority Myanmar regard the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The United Nations described Myanmar's crackdown as ethnic cleansing, which Myanmar denies.
""I pity her because she seems to be caught in the middle of being a Nobel Prize winner for peace and this is now the ruckus, she is heavily criticized,"" Duterte said in his speech.
Human rights groups have also strongly criticized Duterte's anti-narcotics campaign during which more than 3,900 suspected drug users and peddlers have been killed in what the police called self-defense after armed suspects resisted arrest.

Critics dispute that and say executions are taking place with zero accountability, allegations the police reject.

A spate of high-profile arrests has shed light on graft, mismanagement and nepotism in state firms at a time of accelerating privatization, while spotlighting the ascendancy of a more conservative faction in the ruling Communist Party.
Nguyen Ngoc Su of SBIC, formerly known as debt-laden and troubled Vinashin, ""abused his rank and position"", Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security said in a statement on its website.
Su was accused of using Vinashin's deposit in domestic lender Ocean Bank to make profits for some individuals at the shipping firm, police said.
Lending violations at Ocean Bank have sent dozens of people to jail and handed a death sentence to its former chief executive Nguyen Xuan Son - the first time in years that such a senior former official received the death penalty.
Son was also a former chairman of state energy group PetroVietnam, where Su was served as a vice chief executive.

The court in southewestern Koh Kong province sentenced Dem Kundy, 21, and Hun Vannak, 35, members of the conservation group Mother Nature, their defense lawyer, Sam Chamroeun, said. Each was also fined $250.
""They are innocent all along,"" he told Reuters of the two activists, whom rights group Amnesty International considers prisoners of conscience.
Dem Kundy and Hun Vannak were arrested on September 12 last year and convicted of violation of privacy and incitement to commit a felony when they filmed vessels suspected of illegally carrying sand for export.
Cambodia banned all sand exports last year, officially ending the sale of sand to the wealthy city state of Singapore which has for years used it to reclaim land along its coasts.
Skeptical about whether the ban was being properly enforced, Mother Nature and other groups pressed the government to stop the trade, saying the digging and dredging of sand has had a serious impact on coastal ecosystems and surrounding land.
The sentences came a day after their trial on Thursday.
But domestic rights group Licadho said there was insufficient evidence to convict.
""It's shocking that the two Mother Nature youths were convicted by the Koh Kong court for only trying to protect and preserve natural resources for the current and future generations in Cambodia,"" said Naly Pilorge, its director. 
Cambodia expelled Spanish national and co-founder of Mother Nature, Alejandro Gonzalez-Davidson, in February 2015.

""The program of deep changes in our country will not slow down, on the contrary - there cannot be any talk about reaching an agreement with powers that for years treated Poland as their own private loot,"" Kaczynski told the daily Gazeta Polska Codziennie.
Last month Poland became the first EU member state to have an article 7 rule-of-law procedure launched against it by the European Commission over a judicial overhaul that Brussels says is subverting rule of law standards.
Poland's new Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz said last week that the EU's Court of Justice should be involved in the procedures against Poland as ""the only institution that is entitled"" to decide whether the EU law and standards are being respected.
Kaczynski said that Czaputowicz's remarks were not precise.
""There is, of course, no way Poland would hand in a decision on the court reforms to the Court of Justice. This is our internal competence guaranteed by EU law,"" he said.
Kaczynski, who holds no official government post, became the country's de-facto leader after PiS won elections in late 2015.
Poland's new prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said earlier this month the country's dispute with the European Commission was just a ""misunderstanding"" and that dialogue was needed.
The invocation of article 7 is a major political embarrassment for Poland, but the EU is unlikely to impose the ultimate sanction of suspending Poland's voting rights because its ally Hungary has vowed to veto any such move.

China's State Power Investment Corp (SPIC) [CPWRI.UL], China Datang Corp [SASADT.UL], China Huaneng Group [HUANP.UL] and China Huadian Corp [CNHUA.UL] have asked the government in a letter to boost supplies of coal and tame a wild price rally. 
The letter, reviewed by Reuters, was sent to the National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC) and dated Jan. 22. A source familiar with the letter confirmed its authenticity. 
NDRC was not immediately available for comment. 
""If the coal inventories don't rise to a reasonable level by Spring Festival, then it will be really difficult to deal with the drop in temperatures in some key regions and in the winter heating regions,"" the letter said. 
Some utilities only have enough supplies for two to three days, the letter said, while others are getting hit by a big increase in rail transportation fees. 
Spring Festival, also known as Chinese or Lunar New Year, starts in mid-February this year. The week-long holiday is the longest in the Chinese calendar. 
Thermal coal futures have jumped nearly 10 percent this year, extending a months-long rally, as utilities have scrambled for supplies this week to deal with soaring demand because of a cold snap that has swept across the north. 
Utilities are under particular pressure due to low natural gas supplies after Beijing ordered millions of households and some industrial plants in northern China to change to gas heating from coal as part of its war on pollution. 
On Friday, the most-active thermal coal futures contract closed at 673 yuan ($106.50) per ton, up 0.63 percent, after hitting a record intraday high of 674.2 a ton.

677,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 04:44AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China to name Harvard-trained Liu He as vice premier overseeing economy - sources,"By Kevin Yao and Benjamin Kang Lim
BEIJING (Reuters) - China is set to name Liu He, a Harvard-trained economist who advises President Xi Jinping, as a vice premier overseeing the economy and financial sector, five sources familiar with the development said. 
Liu's promotion would be part of a wider government reshuffle following the 19th Communist Party Congress in October last year, during which Xi laid out his vision for China's long-term development, and elevated his key allies.
At the congress, 66-year old Liu - a trusted confidant of Xi and his top adviser on economic policies - was elected into the 25-member Politburo, the second-highest tier in Beijing's political power structure after the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee. 
Xi has vowed to fend off ""major risks"" in the world's second-largest economy over the next three years as he seeks to cement the country's position as a leading global power.
""He (Liu) is likely to take overall control of China's economic policies and financial issues,"" said a source, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Liu, who heads the General Office of the ruling Communist Party's Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs, is likely to succeed Ma Kai, one of China's four vice premiers, the sources said.
Ma has been in charge of macroeconomic policies and the financial sector. The 71-year-old Ma was left out of the Politburo in October, suggesting he is likely to step down soon.
Liu is also set to replace Ma as head of the cabinet-level Financial Stability and Development Committee (FSDC), three of the sources said.
The committee was set up in November to improve supervision coordination among regulators to fend off financial risks.
The State Council Information Office, the government's public relations arm, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. 
    WELL QUALIFIED
    Sources said Liu is well qualified for the new job given his deep understanding of China's economic issues, and his role in communications between China and U.S. leaders.  
    Liu, who gained a master's degree in public administration at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in 1995, is widely seen masterminding Xi's supply-side reform drive to cut excess factory capacity and upgrade the economy.
    Liu, who speaks fluent English, won a top Chinese economics study award in 2015 for his research on the global financial crisis. 
    He was also widely seen by political analysts as being behind the voice of an unnamed ""authoritative person"" who wrote in the People's Daily, the party's mouthpiece, in May 2016 warning about risks from the country's debt-driven growth model.
    Liu, who is also vice minister of the cabinet's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) - China's top economic planner - has played a behind-the-scenes role in drafting economic policies and reform plans. 
    In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, Liu said China will roll out fresh market-opening measures this year and added such measures will exceed outside expectations.   
    Liu, like Zhou Xiaochuan, China's central bank head, stands out among Chinese bureaucrats because of his grey hair. Many top officials dye their hair jet-black. 
    Zhou, the longest-serving central bank chief since the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, is expected to retire soon. Zhou, who has been running the central bank since 2002, will turn 70 this year.
Liu has been closely following Xi on regional tours and meetings with foreign leaders. When then-U.S. National Security Adviser Tom Donilon visited Beijing in 2013, Xi introduced Liu as ""very important to me"", according to the Wall Street Journal.
Liu and Xi have similar backgrounds - both their families were purged during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, and both their fathers were senior officials. 
“Without the reflection on the catastrophe of the Cultural Revolution, it is impossible for China to have today's economic growth,” Liu said in an article published in 2017.
   A source with ties to the leadership said Xi and Liu knew each other during their teens, and have kept in touch over the years. 
Liu got a master's degree in industrial economy from Beijing's Renmin University in 1986 and later joined the State Planning Commission - the predecessor of NDRC.

HARARE (Reuters) - The University of Zimbabwe has published former First Lady Grace Mugabe's PhD thesis after an anti-corruption watchdog said it was investigating whether the wife of ousted President Robert Mugabe was wrongly awarded a doctorate three years ago.
Grace graduated in 2014, the same year she launched her career in the ruling ZANU-PF party, a power push that led ultimately to November's de facto coup by political rivals worried she was set to take over from her husband.
In contravention of its normal practice, the university did not publish her 226-page thesis, entitled ""The changing social structure and functions of the family: The case of children's homes in Zimbabwe"", until this week, when it was released on its website (http://ir.uz.ac.zw/handle/10646/3463).
It was not clear why Grace, who runs a children's home near her family dairy farm outside Harare, used her second name and maiden surname - Ntombizodwa G. Marufu - for the paper.
University of Zimbabwe vice chancellor Levi Nyagura did not respond to calls for comment.
There had been widespread speculation that Grace had been fraudulently awarded the doctorate, which was dedicated to her husband ""because of his dedication and commitment to the well-being of the people of Zimbabwe"".
But Grace, who was lauded as ""learned mother of the nation"" by adulating followers, defended her academic record, telling a ZANU-PF rally in September that she had earned her PhD when her detractors thought otherwise.
In its abstract, Grace acknowledged that one weakness of her research was that ""some interviewees tended to tell me what they thought I wanted to hear"".
Goodson Nguni, lead investigator at the Zimbabwe Anti Corruption Commission, could not be reached for comment on whether the anti-graft agency would continue with its probe. 

New President Emmerson Mnangagwa has made fighting corruption a top priority. Mnangagwa, 75, told the World Economic Forum in Davos this week Mugabe and his wife Grace had not been granted immunity from prosecution.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives opened coalition talks with their Social Democrat (SPD) partners on Friday, promising swift progress in negotiations aimed at ending four months of political limbo in Europe's largest economy.
Arriving at her Christian Democrat (CDU) party's headquarters, Merkel said she was optimistic and determined about the discussions aimed at renewing the ""grand coalition"" that governed for the past four years.
""People expect us to move towards forming a government and that's why I'm very optimistic and very determined,"" she said. The talks are her best hope of securing a fourth term after the failure of an earlier attempt to form a three-way coalition.
""I believe it is achievable within a reasonable timeframe,"" she added.
While most experts expect talks to succeed, many in the SPD are reluctant, seeing a repeat coalition as at best a painful sacrifice by their party for the sake of stability in Europe's economic and political behemoth.
Appealing to them, leader Martin Schulz stressed their party's global responsibility.
""Given the challenges from China and the U.S., the European Union needs a strong, pro-European Germany,"" he said. ""And that you will only get if the SPD is in government.""
Underlining the stakes for the SPD, one of two ""people's parties"" that dominated post-war German history, a poll for ARD television showed only 19 percent would vote for it in repeat elections, placing it just seven points ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Riven by division over whether it would not be better to rebuild in opposition, the SPD's leadership is under pressure from its radical youth wing to win concessions from the conservatives, on immigration in particular.
The conservatives are wary. They are under pressure from the AfD, which burst into parliament for the first time on Sept. 24, propelled by public concerns over Merkel's decision to open Germany's doors to more than a million refugees in 2015.
In a draft agreement the two camps hammered out this month, the parties agreed a soft ceiling of 220,000 immigrants a year, one the Christian Social Union (CSU), arch-conservative Bavarian sister party to Merkel's CDU, refuses to compromise on.
Despite the tensions, leader Horst Seehofer was positive. ""The CSU wants this coalition,"" he told reporters on the gloomy Berlin winter morning.
Senior SPD member Democrat Andrea Nahles told broadcaster ARD her party would also push its agenda of eliminating fixed-term contracts without substantive grounds and improving conditions for citizens who pay into the public rather than private healthcare system, seeking concessions on those issues.
Negotiators hope to wrap talks up before carnival season starts in earnest on Feb. 8, which would allow a government to be in place by Easter.

But time presses. The SPD membership has been promised a vote on a final coalition deal. With new members thronging to the party in the hope of casting a vote against a new coalition, chances of securing membership consent diminish by the day.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - China's growing presence and investment in a fast-developing Cambodian port and province have pushed up the crime rate and brought instability, its governor said in a letter to the government.
Anti-China comments are rare in a country that has welcomed Chinese investment with open arms. Prime Minister Hun Sen is a close Beijing ally and China is Cambodia's biggest source of foreign direct investment by far.
Preah Sihanoukville province in the southwest has seen a construction boom in recent years supported by a steady stream of Chinese money into building hotels, casinos and thousands of apartments.
Govenor Yun Min said in a three-page letter sent to the interior minister that the Chinese influx had ""created opportunities for Chinese mafia to come in and commit various crimes and kidnap Chinese investors, causing insecurity in the province"".
Reuters obtained the letter on Friday and confirmed its authenticity with Yun Min and the Interior Ministry.
Sihanoukville is an illustration of how China's money has transformed a sleepy backpacker town into an economic hub, binding Cambodia's economy even closer to China.
China's support has allowed Hun Sen to defy Western criticism of a crackdown on his opponents. The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party was dissolved by Cambodia's Supreme Court at the request of Hun Sen's government. 
That followed a crackdown on opposition figures, independent media and civil society groups.
In his letter to the government, Yun Min also complained about drunk Chinese getting into fights in restaurants and about rising hotel prices as a result of Chinese interest in Sihanoukville.
Not all his comments were negative, however. Yun Min said Chinese investment had created jobs and pushed up real estate prices in the province.
Khieu Sopheak, a spokesman for the interior ministry, said he had not yet seen the letter but added that Cambodia would not be controlled by the Chinese.
""We still keep our sovereignty, the Chinese can't control us,"" Khieu Sopheak told Reuters. ""If they come as proper investors and respect our laws, it's fine.""

682,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",Trump to pitch America First to Davos elites,"By Noah Barkin and Yara Bayoumy
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to use his maiden speech to the World Economic Forum on Friday to promote his tax cuts, deregulation and trade policies to chief executives, bankers and political leaders.
Trump, who flew into the sanctum of the global elite at the Swiss ski resort of Davos on Thursday, will deliver the event's main closing address after a week of veiled criticism of his America First agenda by several world leaders here.
The first sitting U.S. president to visit the annual summit since Bill Clinton in 2000, Trump was greeted on arrival by hundreds of curious delegates who snapped pictures as he entered the congress center.
He made an immediate impression: he talked up the dollar, going against the grain of previous remarks made by his treasury secretary at Davos, and threatened to withhold aid to Palestinians unless they pursued peace with Israel.
But the main thrust of his visit will be to convince business leaders to step up investment in the United States.
""A lot of people are coming back to the United States. We are seeing tremendous investment and today has been a very exciting day. Very great day and great for our country. Thank you very much,"" Trump told reporters in Davos on Thursday.
After meeting the prime ministers of Britain and Israel, Trump hosted a dinner with leaders of some of the world's largest firms, including Nestle, SAP and Siemens, Deloitte and Bayer (DE:BAYGN). Senior members of his cabinet were also present.
Trump, a real estate mogul and former reality TV star, had never been invited to Davos before. He basked in the praise of several executives, who applauded his tax cuts.
Two European executives told Reuters they were staying away from the dinner because they did not want to shake Trump's hand. One of them consulted with his wife and children before deciding to dine elsewhere. 
Those that showed up were treated to a meal of grilled beef tenderloin with green pea puree or fried Swiss pike perch with purple carrot puree.
Trump gave each corporate leader an opportunity to describe their businesses briefly. Many mentioned the corporate tax cuts that Trump pushed through the U.S. Congress late last year as a positive sign of growth and investment, according to a Reuters reporter who was present.
Trump is due to address the forum on Friday afternoon and White House aides said his message would be the same that he has given during other trips abroad over the past year: The United States wants strong ties with its allies but is also determined to reduce its chronic trade deficits with many of them. 
His speech comes after a week of warnings by European leaders on the dangers of nationalism, isolationism and protectionism.
Without naming Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel evoked the build-up to the two world wars and openly questioned whether leaders had learned the lessons from those 20th century conflicts.
Before his trip to Davos, Trump imposed 30 percent tariffs on imported solar panels, among the first unilateral trade restrictions made by the administration as part of a broader protectionist agenda.
On Wednesday in Davos, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made comments supportive of a weaker dollar. Markets interpreted the remarks as a shift in U.S. policy and sent the dollar sharply lower, sparking concerns from European allies about a trade war.
European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi took a swipe at Mnuchin's remarks, saying they threatened a decades-old pact between the world's leading economies not to target currencies.
Trump later told CNBC in an interview that he supported a strong dollar and expected the currency to rise.
""The dollar is going to get stronger and stronger and ultimately I want to see a strong dollar,"" he said, adding that Mnuchin's comments had been misinterpreted.
Trump's decision to come to Davos came as a surprise because he has railed against ""globalists"" and elites, while promoting an ""America First"" agenda that goes down poorly in this bastion of free trade, multilateralism and capitalism.
French President Emmanuel Macron said he had ""strongly recommended"" that Trump attend the forum during a recent phone conversation, saying he thought it was a good thing for Trump to explain his strategic goals and hear different viewpoints.
There is broad concern in European capitals that 2018 could be the year Trump's bark on trade turns into bite, as he considers punitive measures on steel and threatens to end the 90s-era North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.
Policymakers have been openly critical of his foreign policy but with the U.S. stock market soaring, corporate tax cuts padding companies' pockets and U.S. consumers spending again, some companies here are quietly applauding the U.S. president.
Trump used a TV appearance from Davos to laud America's relationship with Britain and sought to smooth over a recent bilateral spat caused by his retweeting of anti-Muslim videos originally posted by a leader of a far-right group.
Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain show, he was pressed on whether he would apologize for his retweet. He said that if the group was made up of racists then he would.

""Here’s what’s fair, if you’re telling me they’re horrible people, horrible racist people I would certainly apologize if you would like me to do that,"" Trump said.

The proposed visit, set for March at the central port of Danang, could bring the most U.S. forces to Vietnam since the Vietnam war ended in 1975.
The arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier in Vietnam will be welcomed by an emerging network of countries nervously eyeing China's military rise, particularly its assertive stance and island-building activities in the strategic South China Sea.
China claims most of the busy waterway, where Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have competing claims.
Asked whether China had any concerns about the carrier's visit, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China was always happy to see countries developing friendly, cooperative relations. 
""As long as this kind of military exchange between Vietnam and the United States is beneficial to regional peace and stability, then, of course, we have no objection,"" she told a daily news briefing, without elaborating.
Vietnam has emerged as the most vocal opponent of China's territorial claims and has been buying U.S. military hardware, such as an armed, Hamilton-class Coast Guard cutter.

Speaking to reporters after visiting wounded soldiers in hospitals, Ahmet Demircan said three Turkish soldiers and 11 fighters from Turkey-backed FSA factions have been killed so far in clashes in northern Syria.
He said 130 people had been brought to Turkish hospitals and that 82 of them had been released after receiving treatment. None of the wounded were in critical condition, he said, adding that additional medical personnel were sent to the area.
On Saturday, Turkey launched an offensive against the Kurdish YPG militia, which it views as a security threat, in Syria's Afrin, opening a new front in the multi-sided Syrian civil war and further straining ties with its NATO ally Washington.
Dozens of combatants and more than two dozen civilians have been killed so far in the offensive, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, has said.
The Turkish military said in a statement on Friday it had killed at least 343 militants in northern Syria since the operation started.

His remarks come after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker made clear last year that progress on a treaty before mid-2018 was needed to ensure enhanced Swiss access to the single market continues.
Maurer, from the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP), took a far bleaker line with the Neue Zuercher Zeitung paper than has new Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis, who is due to present his European policy approach to cabinet colleagues next week.
""A framework treaty (with the EU) is not possible in the foreseeable future,"" Maurer said. ""If we try it nonetheless, both sides put themselves under pressure and this will not lead to good negotiating results.
""We should also not try to wrap up negotiations before Brexit. We don't move so quickly. This does not reflect our mentality,"" he added in a reference to separate negotiations Brussels is conducting with Britain over terms of its exit from the bloc.
Maurer said it was time to be realistic with Brussels about prospects for a deal after Swiss officials had sent mixed signals about a treaty to replace a patchwork of 120 bilateral accords that now govern ties between Switzerland and its most important trading partner.
Relations with the European Union soured in December as Bern threatened retaliation over what it called unacceptable limitations on Swiss stock exchanges' access to the single market.
The row threatened to set back ties that had been thawing after the Swiss parliament in 2016 skirted voters' demands for immigration quotas for EU citizens.
The anti-immigration SVP has long opposed a new treaty that would give the European Court of Justice a say in settling disputes. But leading politicians from mainstream conservative parties have also expressed reservations about rushing into a deal before the outcome of Brexit negotiations is clear.

Relations between Russia and Britain are strained. Prime Minister Theresa May last year accused Moscow of military aggression and in December, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said there was evidence showing Russian meddling in Western elections. 
Britain has also scrambled jets in recent months to intercept Russian jets near the United Kingdom's airspace. 
""The plan for the Russians won’t be for landing craft to appear in the South Bay in Scarborough, and off Brighton Beach,"" defense minister Gavin Williamson, tipped as a possible successor to May, was quoted as saying by The Telegraph.

January 26 marks the anniversary of the first British settlers landing in Sydney Cove, New South Wales, in 1788, but for indigenous Australians, the date means the start of oppression, including dozens of massacres throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.
More than 25,000 people, Aboriginal and white, joined a demonstration in Melbourne, Australia's second biggest city, organizers said, marching up to State Parliament House chanting ""always was, always will be Aboriginal land"".
One of the organizers, Ken Canning, of the Fighting In Resistance Equally activist group, said he hoped the rallies would increase awareness.
""The idea here is to engage the general public because our political spectrum around the country ... ignores the calls of Aboriginal people,"" he said.
At least 3,000 protested in Sydney, with rallies also held in Hobart, Adelaide and other cities. There were no reports of violence.
There are about 700,000 Aborigines in a population of 23 million in Australia, whose descendants date back about 50,000 years before British colonizers arrived. They suffer disproportionately high rates of suicide, alcohol abuse, domestic violence and imprisonment.
Protesters called for a treaty between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, recognition in the constitution, and an end to inequality. Protesters want the date of Australia Day to be changed, or abolished altogether.
Whether to change the date of Australia Day has been a subject of debate for many years, as has whether to change the Australian flag, which includes the British Union Jack.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ruled out a change of flag.
""That’s the one they have on their backpacks when they’re traveling overseas, that’s the flag that our soldiers have on their shoulder patches, that is our flag,” he told reporters.

""So, I think the Australian flag will be flying over Parliament House long after all of us have shuffled off the stage of history.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's special envoy for North Korea said on Friday there were ""complex"" reasons why he has yet to visit the country, but that China's efforts to help bring about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and foster peace were relentless and unchanged.
Vice Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou, who is ethnically Korean, became Beijing's special envoy to North Korea last August.
His predecessor, Wu Dawei, made his last publicly announced visit to North Korea in early 2016, urging restraint after North Korea announced a plan to put a satellite into orbit with a long-range rocket.
""The reason I've not been to North Korea since being appointed the Chinese government's special envoy for Korean peninsula matters is very complex,"" Kong told reporters.
""But no matter whether or not (I) go to North Korea, our firm stance on being dedicated to maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula and the denuclearization process has not changed,"" he added.
""Our proactive diplomatic mediation work has also not stopped for a moment.""
Song Tao, who heads the ruling Chinese Communist Party's international department, was the last top official from China to go to Pyongyang, in November. 
Song was there to discuss the outcome of a party congress in China and statements from both countries made no mention of the nuclear crisis.
North Korea has shown less and less interest in dealing with China diplomatically over its weapons program or listening to Beijing's pleas.
China is North Korea's closest ally, but it has been infuriated by the North's repeated missile and nuclear tests and has signed up for increasingly tough U.N. sanctions on the isolated nation.
Kong said China welcomed a recent improvement in the situation, with the two Koreas reaching agreement on North Korea's participation in next month's Winter Olympics.
He said China hoped the talks could pave the way to rebuilding mutual trust and eventually turn toward resolving tensions on the peninsula. 
""Even though the current contacts and dialogue have mainly revolved around cooperation on the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, we believe this backdrop is conducive to pushing the Korean peninsula a further step toward alleviation,"" he said.

China says sanctions are not the final way to resolve the issue, and has repeatedly called for a return to diplomacy and the restart of a six-party talks process with North Korea, which includes China, the two Koreas, the United States, Russia and Japan and which collapsed in 2008.

The court's ruling was just the latest blow to the demoralized opposition, which is seeking to unseat unpopular leftist Maduro in the midst of a brutal economic crisis.
The opposition's most popular leaders, such as Leopoldo Lopez and Henrique Capriles, are barred from standing in the election, slated to be held before April 30. Some are in jail, others are in exile or banned from politics.
The coalition had planned to hold primaries to settle on a joint candidate. But Thursday's ruling said the coalition violated the principle of avoiding ""double affiliation"" in politics and therefore could not be validated.
Critics of Maduro slammed the accusation as baseless and said the decision was another demonstration of an electoral process riddled with wrongdoing.
""The constitutional chamber's decision shows that these are judges rented out for the government's electoral strategy,"" said Omar Barboza, the new president of the opposition-led congress.
It was not immediately clear what the coalition's next moves would be. Opposition parties will have to decide whether to submit individually to the pre-election validation process, which is scheduled to take place this coming weekend.

White House lawyers and press officials did not immediately reply to Reuters requests for comment.
Mueller, who is investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, learned of the incident in recent months as his investigators interviewed current and former senior White House officials in an inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice, the Times reported.
Amid media reports that Mueller was looking into a possible obstruction case, Trump argued that the former Federal Bureau of Investigation director had three conflicts of interest that disqualified him from overseeing the probe, two of the people said, according to the Times report.
First, Trump said that a dispute years ago over fees at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, had led Mueller to resign his membership, the newspaper reported. 
The president also said Mueller could not be impartial because he had most recently worked for a law firm that previously represented the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Trump also said Mueller had been interviewed to return as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation the day before he was appointed special counsel in May, the Times reported, citing the two people.
White House counsel Donald McGahn said he would quit rather than follow through on the order to fire Mueller, the Times reported, citing the people.
McGahn disagreed with the president’s case for dismissing Mueller and told senior White House officials that firing him would have a catastrophic effect on Trump’s presidency and raise questions about whether the White House was trying to obstruct the Russia probe, according to the people cited by the Times.
McGahn also told White House officials that Trump would not follow through on the dismissal on his own, and the president then backed off his demand, according to the people, who the Times said spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a continuing investigation.
Mueller was appointed special counsel in May by the Justice Department after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the agency's Russia investigation. Russia has denied any meddling and Trump has denied any collusion. 
Comey's firing is central to whether Trump may have committed obstruction of justice.

Trump said on Wednesday he would be willing to be interviewed under oath by Mueller, and according to sources with knowledge of the investigation, Trump's attorneys have been talking to Mueller's team about an interview.

Trade Minister Abdul Falah al-Sudany resigned in 2009 and fled the country in connection with graft allegations involving Iraq's food rations program, one of the world's biggest.
Iraq's Integrity Commission on Thursday evening issued a statement confirming the return of al-Sudany after reaching a deal with the Lebanese authorities late last year allowing the extradition of the ex-trade minister.
""Former trade minister Abdul Falah al-Sudany is now in the integrity commission custody,"" the statement said. 
The corruption watchdog said Interpol contributed to the arrest of al-Sudany after reaching Beirut in September 2017. 
Al-Sudany is wanted for at least nine corruption cases and received eight imprisonment sentences in absentia for graft charges related to food import violations, the corruption watchdog said in the statement. 
Iraq is one of the world's biggest importers of wheat and rice. Several Trade Ministry officials have faced corruption allegations in the past.
The ministry buys hundreds of thousands of tonnes a year of sugar, lentils, grains and other food and basic household goods to supply a national ration program.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Marijuana should be legalized in two of Mexico's main tourist hot spots, Cancun and Los Cabos, in order to reduce criminal violence, Mexico's minister for tourism said on Thursday.
Minister Enrique de la Madrid said Mexico could follow the example of the United States and legalize marijuana in areas with support, urging Quintana Roo, where Cancun lies, and Baja California Sur, the home of Los Cabos, to move ahead with it.
""It's absurd that we're not taking this step as a country,"" de la Madrid told reporters at a conference in Mexico City.
""Even if there's work to do on the whole of the country, I'd like to see that it might be done in Baja California and Quintana Roo,"" he added, describing the states as victims of a poor drug law.
Baja California and Quintana Roo have been two of the states hardest hit by a jump in gang violence in the country over the past year, helping to prompt verbal swipes from U.S. President Donald Trump about how dangerous it is in Mexico.
De la Madrid later said in a Twitter post that his comments reflected his personal views.
President Enrique Pena Nieto has said the United States and Mexico should not pursue diverging policies on marijuana. In 2016, he proposed a bill to allow Mexicans to carry up to an ounce of marijuana, but the measure stalled in Congress.
Carlos Mendoza, governor of Baja California Sur, told local media that if the idea were adopted, it should be implemented in various areas popular with tourists.
""It seems foolish and illogical that we're here fighting with a strategy that costs lives in Mexico and magically, crossing the border, marijuana becomes legal,"" he said. 
California this month became the sixth U.S. state to legalize the drug despite a federal ban.

Despite the trend toward legalization north of the border, cartels still make millions of dollars from smuggling marijuana into the United States. Mexico legalized marijuana use for medical and scientific needs in June.

The shutting of bars and banning of sales in shops on the day Christians commemorate Christ's death have long been opposed by publicans and restaurant owners, who have argued that they lose business during the busy Easter holiday weekend.
Their battle ended up in the courts eight years ago when a judge granted an exemption to pubs in the western city of Limerick to allow drinking during a match between two provincial rugby rivals. 
The restrictions have largely been in place since the 1922 foundation of the Irish state and their lifting is a further symbol of the changing face of once stridently Catholic Ireland.
""The Government believes the time is right to end the restrictions. We live in a very different society than that which existed when they were put in place,"" Ireland's junior justice minister, David Stanton, told parliament on Thursday.

The legislation, originally introduced by an independent member of Ireland's upper house of parliament, passed without a vote being required.

698,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 06:22PM ET</span>",Homeless in Hong Kong: soaring costs fuel housing crisis in Asian financial hub,"By Wyman Ma and Chermaine Lee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Cheung Muk-gun's home is an illegal, wooden shack under a highway in one of the poorest areas of Hong Kong, where sky-high property prices and a yawning wealth gap have helped fuel a surge in homelessness. 
The 72-year-old earns about HK$10,000 ($1,279) a month working seven days a week at a frozen meat store in the working-class district of Mong Kok, a short trip across Victoria Harbour from the city's opulent financial center. 
With property prices up 200 percent in the past decade, and a bed in a tiny, windowless apartment - often shared with other tenants - going for about HK$2,000 a month, Cheung said he preferred to live in his shack. 
An apartment of around 250 square feet (23 square meters) in a new building with windows and a bathroom near Mong Kok would rent for about HK$12,000. 
""Why would I want to spend so much on rent, not to mention other related miscellaneous expenses. After paying all that, my salary could hardly cover my daily expenses,"" he said. 
Since Cheung became a street sleeper more than five years ago, Hong Kong's homeless population has jumped about 30 percent to 1,800, according to the Society for Community Organisation (SocO), a non-governmental human rights group.
That compares with government data showing 1,075 registered street sleepers as of end-2017 and is double the 908 recorded in 2016. Government figures do not include so-called ""McRefugees"" who sleep in fast-food chains - whose numbers are significant but not officially counted - indicating homelessness is rapidly worsening in the Chinese territory of 7.3 million people.
While Hong Kong has far fewer homeless residents than, say, the almost 58,000 in Los Angeles County, the pace of their increase has alarmed social workers.
The crisis has piled pressure on the government after scores of protests in recent years over the soaring cost of accommodation. The Social Welfare Department says it is responding by helping street sleepers re-integrate into the community and working with six non-government organizations that operate hostels and emergency shelters.
""During the stay in the hostels, responsible social workers will assist street sleepers to identify long-term accommodation or appropriate residential care,"" a department spokeswoman said. 
In Singapore, Hong Kong's traditional rival as a regional financial hub, the government estimates about 300 individuals and families are homeless out of a population of 5.6 million, thanks mainly to an adequate supply of subsidized housing and more affordable housing generally. 
But in Hong Kong, severe shortages of affordable accommodation are driving more and more people onto the streets. Homelessness is now affecting sections of the population who previously could afford a place to live, such as those with jobs, according to rights groups.
About one in five people live below the poverty line even as Hong Kong's wealth gap swells to its widest in more than four decades. 
""McREFUGEES"" 
While the government provides shelters and subsidized housing for homeless people, critics say caps on the length of time they can stay only offer short-term relief. 
SoCO social worker Ng Wai-tung estimates 25 percent of Hong Kong's homeless population are McRefugees - people who call fast-food outlets home. He expects to see more in the summer when street sleepers seek air-conditioning to cool down. 
Slouched in a corner of a 24-hour McDonald's in Kowloon district, Wong Shek-hei, 65, said he earned HK$7,000 a month as a cleaner. He left a bed that cost about HK$1,500 a month more than three weeks ago, when bed bugs and disturbances from drug addicts drove him to the fast-food restaurant. 
""In summer there are more than 20 people sleeping here,"" he said. 
Reuters visited four 24-hour McDonald's, where it found on average six people bedding down of a night in each of the restaurants. Some lay stretched out with their shoes off, while others slept with their heads on tables. 
""Since more than 120 McDonald's restaurants are operating around the clock among our around 240 restaurants in Hong Kong, there could be chances that some customers stay in our restaurants overnight,"" McDonald's told Reuters.
""McDonald's Hong Kong is accommodating to people (who) stay long in the restaurant for their own respective reasons."" 
As the homeless population grows, rough-sleepers are appearing in areas they were rarely seen previously. 
""The situation has definitely worsened in the past two years and we see Tsuen Wan as a new location for the homeless to gather,"" said Olivia Chan, a social worker with Christian Concern for the Homeless Association, referring to a district on the mainland north of Mong Kok. 
""More and more people are sleeping in fast-food shops now."" 
One McRefugee surnamed Yeung, who has been sleeping at a McDonald's branch for the past eight months, said the outlet was a safe haven for him. 
""McDonald's doesn't approve of you sleeping here, but they turn a blind eye,"" Yeung, who declined to use his full name due to concerns over job security, told Reuters. 
""It's a shelter from the rain, the heat, the cold and the bad.""

699,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 05:53PM ET</span>",Tech firms let Russia probe software widely used by U.S. government,"By Dustin Volz, Joel Schectman and Jack Stubbs
WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Major global technology providers SAP (DE:SAPG), Symantec (O:SYMC) and McAfee have allowed Russian authorities to hunt for vulnerabilities in software deeply embedded across the U.S. government, a Reuters investigation has found.
The practice potentially jeopardizes the security of computer networks in at least a dozen federal agencies, U.S. lawmakers and security experts said. It involves more companies and a broader swath of the government than previously reported. 
In order to sell in the Russian market, the tech companies let a Russian defense agency scour the inner workings, or source code, of some of their products. Russian authorities say the reviews are necessary to detect flaws that could be exploited by hackers. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2sZudWT)
But those same products protect some of the most sensitive areas of the U.S government, including the Pentagon, NASA, the State Department, the FBI and the intelligence community, against hacking by sophisticated cyber adversaries like Russia.
Reuters revealed in October that Hewlett Packard Enterprise (N:HPE) software known as ArcSight, used to help secure the Pentagon's computers, had been reviewed by a Russian military contractor with close ties to Russia's security services.
Now, a Reuters review of hundreds of U.S. federal procurement documents and Russian regulatory records shows that the potential risks to the U.S. government from Russian source code reviews are more widespread.
Beyond the Pentagon, ArcSight is used in at least seven other agencies, including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the State Department's intelligence unit, the review showed. Additionally, products made by SAP, Symantec and McAfee and reviewed by Russian authorities are used in at least eight agencies. Some agencies use more than one of the four products. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2C30rp8)
McAfee, SAP, Symantec and  Micro Focus  (L:MCRO), the British firm that now owns ArcSight, all said that any source code reviews were conducted under the software maker's supervision in secure facilities where the code could not be removed or altered. The process does not compromise product security, they said. Amid growing concerns over the process, Symantec and McAfee no longer allow such reviews and Micro Focus moved to sharply restrict them late last year.
The Pentagon said in a previously unreported letter (http://tmsnrt.rs/2C6o2p2) to Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen that source code reviews by Russia and China “may aid such countries in discovering vulnerabilities in those products.""
Reuters has not found any instances where a source code review played a role in a cyberattack, and some security experts say hackers are more likely to find other ways to infiltrate network systems.
But the Pentagon is not alone in expressing concern. Private sector cyber experts, former U.S. security officials and some U.S. tech companies told Reuters that allowing Russia to review the source code may expose unknown vulnerabilities that could be used to undermine U.S. network defenses.
“Even letting people look at source code for a minute is incredibly dangerous,” said Steve Quane, executive vice president for network defense at Trend Micro, which sells TippingPoint security software to the U.S. military.
Worried about those risks to the U.S. government, Trend Micro has refused to allow the Russians to conduct a source code review of TippingPoint, Quane said.
Quane said top security researchers can quickly spot exploitable vulnerabilities just by examining source code.
“We know there are people who can do that, because we have people like that who work for us,” he said.
In contrast to Russia, the U.S. government seldom requests source code reviews when buying commercially available software products, U.S. trade attorneys and security experts say.
OPENING THE DOOR
Many of the Russian reviews have occurred since 2014, when U.S.-Russia relations plunged to new lows following Moscow’s annexation of Crimea. Western nations have accused Russia of sharply escalating its use of cyber attacks during that time, an allegation Moscow denies.
Some U.S. lawmakers worry source code reviews could be yet another entry point for Moscow to wage cyberattacks.
""I fear that access to our security infrastructure - whether it be overt or covert - by adversaries may have already opened the door to harmful security vulnerabilities,"" Shaheen told Reuters.
In its Dec. 7 letter to Shaheen, the Pentagon said it was “exploring the feasibility” of requiring vendors to disclose when they have allowed foreign governments to access source code. Shaheen had questioned the Pentagon about the practice following the Reuters report on ArcSight, which also prompted Micro Focus to say it would restrict government source code reviews in the future. HPE said none of its current products have undergone Russian source code review.
Lamar Smith, the Republican chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, said legislation to better secure the federal cybersecurity supply chain was clearly needed.
Responding to the Reuters report on Thursday, Democratic Congressman Jim Langevin, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, said the Pentagon must consider ""any access adversaries may have to source code when it is making purchasing decisions."" 
Most U.S. government agencies declined to comment when asked whether they were aware technology installed within their networks had been inspected by Russian military contractors. Others said security was of paramount concern but that they could not comment on the use of specific software.
A Pentagon spokeswoman said it continually monitors the commercial technology it uses for security weaknesses.
NO PENCILS ALLOWED
Tech companies wanting to access Russia's large market are often required to seek certification for their products from Russian agencies, including the FSB security service and Russia’s Federal Service for Technical and Export Control (FSTEC), a defense agency tasked with countering cyber espionage.
FSTEC declined to comment and the FSB did not respond to requests for comment. The Kremlin referred all questions to the FSB and FSTEC.
FSTEC often requires companies to permit a Russian government contractor to test the software’s source code.
SAP HANA, a database system, underwent a source code review in order to obtain certification in 2016, according to Russian regulatory records. The software stores and analyzes information for the State Department, Internal Revenue Service, NASA and the Army.
An SAP spokeswoman said any source code reviews were conducted in a secure, company-supervised facility where recording devices or even pencils are “are strictly forbidden.”
“All governments and governmental organizations are treated the same with no exceptions,” the spokeswoman said.
While some companies have since stopped allowing Russia to review source code in their products, the same products often remain embedded in the U.S. government, which can take decades to upgrade technology.
Security concerns caused Symantec to halt all government source code reviews in 2016, the company’s chief executive told Reuters in October. But Symantec Endpoint Protection antivirus software, which was reviewed by Russia in 2012, remains in use by the Pentagon, the FBI, and the Social Security Administration, among other agencies, according to federal contracting records reviewed by Reuters.
In a statement, a Symantec spokeswoman said the newest version of Endpoint Protection, released in late 2016, never underwent a source code review and that the earlier version has received numerous updates since being tested by Russia. The California-based company said it had no reason to believe earlier reviews had compromised product security. Symantec continued to sell the older version through 2017 and will provide updates through 2019.
McAfee also announced last year that it would no longer allow government-mandated source code reviews.
The cyber firm’s Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) software was reviewed in 2015 by a Moscow-based government contractor, Echelon, on behalf of FSTEC, according to Russian regulatory documents. McAfee confirmed this.
The Treasury Department and Defense Security Service, a Pentagon agency tasked with guarding the military’s classified information, continue to rely on the product to protect their networks, contracting records show.
McAfee declined to comment, citing customer confidentiality agreements, but it has previously said the Russian reviews are conducted at company-owned premises in the United States.
'YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYONE'
On its website, Echelon describes itself as an official laboratory of the FSB, FSTEC, and Russia’s defense ministry. Alexey Markov, the president of Echelon, which also inspected the source code for ArcSight, said U.S. companies often initially expressed concerns about the certification process.
""Did they have any? Absolutely!!"" Markov wrote in an email.
""The less the person making the decision understands about programming, the more paranoia they have. However, in the process of clarifying the details of performing the certification procedure, the dangers and risks are smoothed out.”
Markov said his team always informs tech companies before handing over any discovered vulnerabilities to Russian authorities, allowing the firms to fix the detected flaw. The source code reviews of products “significantly improves their safety,” he said.
Chris Inglis, the former deputy director of the National Security Agency, the United States' premier electronic spy agency, disagrees.
""When you're sitting at the table with card sharks, you can't trust anyone,"" he said. ""I wouldn't show anybody the code.""

The counter terrorism designations announced by the U.S. Treasury Department bars the two Pakistanis and four Afghans living in Pakistan from accessing the U.S. financial system.
While unlikely to cause many problems for its targets, the move further underlines Washington's frustration with Islamabad for providing sanctuary and other aid to the insurgent groups.
In a surprise tweet on New Year's Day, Trump said the United States had ""foolishly"" given Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid and ""they have given us nothing but lies and deceit, thinking our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!""
The announcement sent U.S. officials scrambling to suspend security assistance, later estimated at up to about $2 billion, to the nuclear-armed ally.
Pakistani officials were infuriated by the action. Its National Security Committee of senior civilian and military chiefs denounced it as ""completely incomprehensible."" U.S. Ambassador David Hale was summoned to the foreign ministry for an explanation.
Pakistan is a crucial gateway for U.S. military supplies destined for U.S. and other troops fighting a 16-year-old war in neighboring, landlocked Afghanistan.
A senior Trump administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on Jan. 5 that Washington hoped that the aid suspension would be enough to communicate its concern to Islamabad.
But the official cautioned that the freeze was also not the only tool that America had to pressure the country - suggesting it might resort to other measures, if needed.
""We are considering many different things, not just the (financial) assistance issue,"" the official said.
The United States has long blamed the militant safehavens in Pakistan for prolonging the war in Afghanistan, giving insurgents, including from the Haqqani network, a place to plot attacks and rebuild its forces. 
""We believe we owe it to the Americans in harm's way in Afghanistan. We simply can't ignore the sanctuaries if we are going to make progress in Afghanistan,"" the official said.

Russian media quoted the Defense Ministry in Moscow as saying this week that Russia would sell six SU-30 planes to Myanmar. The RIA news agency said Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, was interested in buying other Russian military hardware for its land and naval forces.
""We’ve seen some new troubling media reports that Russia intends to sell SU-30 fighter jets to the Burmese armed forces,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a news briefing.
""The reports, if confirmed, serve as another reminder of Russia's continued efforts to arm militaries that flagrantly violate human rights,"" she said.
Nauert referred to the Myanmar military's treatment of minority Rohingya Muslims in the country's Rakhine State, which had prompted the flight of 680,000 to Bangladesh.
""While the Russian Federation says it favors constructive dialogue to resolve the crisis in Burma, the reports of plans to sell advanced military technology, if true, show otherwise.
""We urge the governments of both Russia and Burma to reconsider a further buildup in arms and fully commit their efforts to finding a peaceful and stable solution to that crisis,"" she said.
The Myanmar military cracked down last year in the northern part of Rakhine State in response to militant attacks on security forces.
The United States previously urged countries to suspend arms sales to Myanmar in response to the crackdown.

706,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 03:05PM ET</span>",Turkey to U.S.: End support for Syrian Kurd YPG or risk confrontation,"By Tuvan Gumrukcu and Dahlia Nehme
ANKARA/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Turkey urged the United States on Thursday to halt its support for Kurdish YPG fighters or risk confronting Turkish forces on the ground in Syria, some of Ankara's strongest comments yet about a potential clash with its NATO ally.
The remarks, from the spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan's government, underscored the growing bilateral tensions, six days after Turkey launched its air and ground operation, ""Olive Branch"", in Syria's northwestern Afrin region.
In Washington, the Pentagon said that it carefully tracked weapons provided to the YPG and would continue discussions with Turkey.
""We carefully track those weapons that are provided to them, we ensure that they, to the maximum extent possible, don't fall into the wrong hands and we're continuing discussions with the Turks on this issue,"" Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie, joint staff director, told reporters.
McKenzie said Turkey's operation into Afrin was not helpful and was taking focus away from fighting Islamic State. 
Turkey's targeting of the YPG, which it views as a security threat, has opened a new front in Syria's multi-sided civil war. The Syrian Kurdish group is a main part of a U.S.-backed rebel alliance that has inflicted recent defeats on Islamic State militants.
Any push by Turkish forces towards Manbij, part of a Kurdish-held territory some 100 km (60 miles) east of Afrin, could threaten U.S. efforts in northeast Syria and bring them into direct confrontation with U.S. troops deployed there.
""Those who support the terrorist organization will become a target in this battle,"" Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said. 
""The United States needs to review its solders and elements giving support to terrorists on the ground in such a way as to avoid a confrontation with Turkey,"" Bozdag, who also acts as the government's spokesman, told broadcaster A Haber. 
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, officially as part of an international, U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State. Washington has angered Ankara by providing arms, training and air support to Syrian Kurdish forces that Turkey views as terrorists.
The Kurdish-led autonomous administration that runs Afrin on Thursday called on the Syrian government to defend its border with Turkey in Afrin despite Damascus' stance against Kurdish autonomy. 
""We call on the Syrian state to carry out its sovereign obligations towards Afrin and protect its borders with Turkey from attacks of the Turkish occupier,"" it said in a statement on its website. 
The Syrian government has said it is ready to target Turkish jets in its airspace, but has not intervened so far. It suspects the Kurds of wanting independence in the long-run and does not recognize the autonomous cantons they have set up in northern Syria.
U.S. forces were deployed in and around Manbij to deter Turkish and U.S.-backed rebels from attacking each other and have also carried out training missions in the area. 
U.S. President Donald Trump urged Erdogan on Wednesday to curtail the military operation in Syria, the White House said.
However Turkey has disputed that characterization of the conversation.
Turkey's foreign minister said Erdogan told Trump that U.S. troops should withdraw from Manbij.
Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said she had seen media reports about the comments, but was not aware of any change in U.S. posture.
McKenzie added the United States and Turkey closely coordinated in the region but the United States would also ensure the safety of its troops.

LIMITED GAINS
Six days into the campaign, Turkish soldiers and their Free Syrian Army rebel fighter allies have been battling to gain footholds on the western, northern and eastern flanks of Afrin.
They appear to have made only limited gains, hampered by rain and clouds, which have limited the air support.
Turkish warplanes struck the northern borders of Afrin, in tandem with heavy artillery shelling, and one civilian was killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group. 
Dozens of combatants and more than two dozen civilians have been killed so far in the offensive, the Observatory has said. 
The Turkish military said in a statement it had killed 303 militants in northern Syria since the operation started.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a YPG-dominated umbrella group backed by the United States in the fight against Islamic State, has previously said that Turkey was exaggerating the number of the dead.
Relations between Ankara and Washington have neared breaking point recently over U.S. support for the YPG and other issues.
Ankara considers the YPG to be an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade-long insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast. Washington sees the YPG as an effective partner in the fight against Islamic State in Syria.
Turkey said the United States had proposed a 30 km (19 mile) ""safe zone"" along the border.
""(But) in order for us to discuss the security zone or any other issue with the U.S., we have to reestablish trust,"" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters. 
In Washington, McKenzie said the U.S. and Turkey were continuing talks about a ""secure zone"" but there had been no final decision.
McKenzie said that he had not yet seen a movement of SDF fighters moving from the Euphrates River Valley to reinforce Afrin or Manbij, but was watching closely. 

The Afrin operation has also triggered concern in Germany, another NATO ally, where the caretaker government said it would put on hold any decision on upgrading Turkey's German-made tanks.

On the second anniversary of his disappearance, Italy's main newspapers published an article written by Rome's chief prosecutor Giuseppe Pignatone summarizing the results of a joint investigation with Egyptian authorities.
In the article, Pignatone also said Regeni had been the target of Egyptian surveillance up until the day he vanished. 
Egyptian officials have repeatedly denied any involvement in Regeni's murder and Egyptian Interior Ministry officials were not immediately available on Thursday for comment on Pignatone's remarks.
It is the first time that Pignatone has publicly discussed the results of the investigation. No-one has been accused of Regeni's murder.
""The motive can be easily traced to Giulio's research activities during his months in Cairo,"" Pignatone wrote.
""What also has become clear is that Giulio had for months attracted the attention of Egypt's state apparatus, which continued in an increasingly pressing way until Jan. 25,"" Pignatone said, referring to the day he disappeared.
Regeni's disfigured body was found around a week later in a ditch outside Cairo. 
The Italian had been researching Egypt's independent labor unions for a doctorate at Britain's Cambridge University. Rome prosecutors this month seized the computer and cell phone of his Cambridge tutor, Maha Abdelrahman. Pignatone said an initial examination of the material showed it was ""useful"". 
Cambridge University has rejected any suggestion Abdelrahman might be implicated in his death.

The Regeni case has strained ties between Egypt and Italy, which recalled its ambassador over the case. Relations were restored in August when Rome said it would return its ambassador to Cairo and continue to search for Regeni's killers.

The children were taken prisoner during fighting with the with the Iran-allied Houthi militia on the border of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh's Center for International Communication said, citing an unnamed official source.
""Houthi coup militias are forcing Yemeni children and youths to fight, pushing them to battlefronts and using them in failed operations,"" the statement said. It said that all the children were transported to Marib province in northern Yemen, which is under Yemeni government control.
Human Rights Watch had said in past reports that both sides of the Yemen conflict have deployed child soldiers.

The announcement came after hundreds of unemployed people demonstrated on Monday at the Ministry of Manpower in Oman's capital Muscat, and another protest in the southern city of Salah, according to witnesses. 
""The cabinet is closely monitoring the implementation of the decision to create 25,000 jobs ... in no more than 6 months as a first phase,"" said a statement published by the state news agency.
Government work with private sector enterprises on the issue was starting to bear fruit, it said. Unemployment reached 17.5 percent in 2016, according to most recent statistics available.
Oman was rocked by Arab Spring-style protests in 2011 in which demonstrators demanded jobs, political reforms and an end to corruption. The protests subsided after authorities promised more jobs.
With smaller oil and financial reserves than its wealthy neighbors, Oman has spent heavily on industrial and infrastructure projects to diversify its economy beyond oil.
This month it announced plans to boost spending in the 2018 budget, despite increasing concern among credit rating agencies about the health of the country's finances.

KAZAN, Russia (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin praised a newly-built supersonic strategic bomber on Thursday after watching it in flight, saying it would beef up Russia's nuclear weapons capability. 
Under a contract signed on Thursday, 10 of the modernized TU-160M nuclear bombers, codenamed Blackjacks by NATO, will be delivered to the Russian Air Force at a cost of 15 billion rubles ($269 million) each between now and 2027.
The giant swing-wing plane is a substantially modernized-version of a Soviet-era bomber that the USSR would have deployed in the event of a nuclear war with the West to deliver nuclear weapons at long distances.
""This is a serious step towards developing our hi-tech sphere and strengthening the country's ability to defend itself,"" said Putin, who said the new plane would strengthen Russia's nuclear weapons capability.
The TU-160M is capable of carrying 12 cruise missiles or 12 short-range nuclear missiles and can fly 12,000 km (7,500 miles) non—stop without re-fuelling. 
Putin, who is standing for re-election on March 18, a contest polls show he is likely to easily win, inspected the factory in Kazan where the new plane is being built as well as an airstrip, hangars and modernized workshops.
Under Putin, who has dominated the political landscape for the last 18 years, Russia has significantly increased defense spending and used military force in Georgia, Ukraine and Syria.
Existing versions of the TU-160 have flown from bases in Russia to Syria where they have bombed forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad, one of Moscow's closest Middle East allies.
Tupolev, the plane's manufacturer, says the modernized version will be 60 percent more effective than the older version with significant improvements to its weaponry, navigation and avionics.
Rinat Khamatov, the plant's chief welder, said Russia needed a modernized version of the bomber. 
""The TU-160...is a weapon of deterrence and it is great that Russia is able to start making it again,"" he told Reuters.

Russia also aims to produce a modernized version of its Il-78 refueling tanker, codenamed Midas by NATO, which can refuel the TU-160 mid-air, enabling it to reach any point on the planet.

711,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 02:11PM ET</span>",Not so anti-establishment now: Italy's 5-Star's evolving face,"By Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - When parliamentarians from Italy's ""anti-establishment"" 5-Star Movement sat down for a closed-door meeting with international banks and hedge funds in November, they feared the encounter was going to be awkward.
The concern was understandable. 5-Star has more friends among the unemployed than among bankers and has often decried the sway of high finance. Yet Carla Ruocco, a lower house lawmaker, said she was pleasantly surprised.
""There were three of us and about 20 of them sat in a circle, she said. ""I expected some prejudice but they seemed open-minded and interested. They mainly asked about the euro and how we would help bring stability after the election.""
The meeting in Rome was part of efforts by Italy's most popular party to reassure markets and investors that it can be trusted with power. It also reflected how much 5-Star has changed since it started in 2009 as an angry protest movement.
On the euro, the investors probably liked what they heard. 5-Star has steadily rowed back on an early plan to hold a referendum on whether Italy should leave the common currency zone, and this month its new, moderate leader Luigi Di Maio said it was no longer a party policy.
Founded by the foul-mouthed comedian Beppe Grillo, who vowed to sweep away Italy's cronyistic ruling class, 5-Star presents a far less threatening face under the young, dapper Di Maio as it bids for power in national elections on March 4.
Grillo has retreated from the limelight and this month announced his popular blog was no longer 5-Star's official mouthpiece. The move raised speculation he was disowning his creation, which Grillo forcefully denied. 
Since he was elected leader of the party and its candidate for prime minister in September, Di Maio, 31, has been meeting with bankers, businessmen, foreign diplomats and members of the Catholic church to try to assuage their concerns.
He has also shifted 5-Star's policies, scrapping not only the euro referendum but also its long-standing refusal to govern with traditional parties.
So far, the voters have followed him. Helped by a split in the ruling Democratic Party (PD), 5-Star leads the polls with about 28 percent of the vote, five points ahead of the PD. 
A center-right alliance of smaller parties, led by Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) totals about 37 percent and is seen winning most parliamentary seats but probably not enough for a working majority.
That could give Di Maio his chance. He says if the center-right bloc is unable to form a government and 5-Star is the largest party, President Sergio Mattarella must give him a mandate to try to win cross-party support for his program.
That includes ""drastic"" cuts to corporate taxes and slashing red tape, as well as 5-Star's flagship policy of guaranteeing a minimum income of up to 780 euros for the poor.
""MORE ACCEPTABLE""
Di Maio's makeover has not gone unnoticed.
""They are seen as more acceptable since they rowed back on the euro referendum. That was the real no-go for markets,"" said Gilles Guibout, who helps manage 730 billion euros ($904 billion) at AXA IM in Paris.
Bankers who have met with 5-Star gave contrasting reports.
A London-based equity analyst with one of the world's largest investment banks who attended the meeting in Rome said he got ""an impression of decent, reasonable people"".
""Considering we were meeting politicians not economists, they were well-informed, I'd say better-informed than politicians from some other parties I have met,"" he said.
A senior Milan-based investor with a large European bank who met 5-Star representatives in Milan said he appreciated their tough stance against corruption, but was shocked by their lack of knowledge about business administration.
""It was quite an eye-opener, they haven't got a clue,"" he said. 
The analyst and the investment banker both asked not to be named because of the political sensitivity of the issue.
Antoine Lesne, head of strategy at State Street ETFs which manages some $680 billion, said if 5-Star won power he expected Italian bond yields would rise initially, but only modestly, and ""nothing like what we saw in 2011 and 2012 during the euro zone debt crisis"". 
As well as reassuring markets, Di Maio is trying to burnish his credentials with business and has spent the last few weeks visiting small- and medium-sized companies around Italy.
The top item on 5-Star's 20-point election platform is a promise to cut red tape by abolishing 400 ""useless"" laws.
It remains to be seen how Di Maio's efforts will be received in the industrial north, which traditionally favors the right and where 5-Star is weak.
So far, the only significant business figure to publicly back 5-Star is Enrico Bracalente, the head of shoemaker and clothing company Nerogiardini, which employs some 2,000 people.
Despite Di Maio's appeal, 5-Star remains a political outsider. Mainstream parties of left and right attack it far more than they attack each other and Italy's public television and its main newspapers, owned by big business, take a similar approach.
""The worst scenario for Italy would be a government run by 5-Star. They are people with no competence at all,"" said business tycoon Carlo De Benedetti, whose family owns the Repubblica daily, which supports the PD.
COURTING THE CHURCH
5-Star has also been courting the Roman Catholic church, which still wields considerable influence in Italy.
Last year Grillo, who has a stormy relationship with the media, surprised many observers by giving a rare interview to the Italian bishops' daily Avvenire, the main mouthpiece of the Italian church. 
While 5-Star's position on matters such as euthanasia, gay marriage and artificial insemination runs counter to Catholic doctrine, the paper's editor said afterward that ""on the big issues, from work to the fight against poverty, in three-quarters of cases we have similar views.""
Di Maio has called for curbs on opening hours for shops on religious holidays, a cause dear to the Church, and during a visit to Washington in November he took time out to meet with the pope's secretary of state and top diplomat Pietro Parolin, who happened to be in the U.S. capital on other business.
Di Maio, who requested the meeting, said he wanted to explain 5-Star's foreign policy to the pope's number 2.
Di Maio and other party members have also started meeting regularly with foreign ambassadors.
Two ambassadors from European countries, who asked not to be named, said Di Maio had gone out of his way to be reassuring, especially on the euro. They both said they were concerned about inconsistencies in the party's messages, however. 

""They want to reassure and be popular but you can't please everyone,"" said one ambassador. ""I think with these changing positions they risk losing credibility rather than gaining it.""

""Bahrain is now clearly sliding in a new and very dangerous direction with 37 people arrested yesterday alone,"" said Brian Dooley of U.S.-based Human Rights First. 
""The fairly weak level of restraint that was there before has all but gone,"" he said, adding that countries influential in Bahrain such as the United States and Britain needed to step up their criticism.
Bahrain, where the Shi'ite Muslim majority is ruled by a Sunni Muslim royal family, has pursued a crackdown on opposition activists since quashing 2011 protests calling for democracy.
Authorities have closed opposition political groupings, revoked dissidents' passports and arrested suspected militants. Activists say many arrests are for political reasons and breach detainees' human rights. 
Bahrain, where the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet is based, denies clamping down on dissent. It says it faces a militant threat backed by arch-foe Iran on the opposite side of the Gulf.
The Bahraini Embassy in Britain, responding to a request for comment, cited an earlier statement which said that the Gulf state was committed ""to transparency and the protection and safeguarding of Human Rights enshrined in the Constitution, as well as in international treaties and obligations"".
Human rights activists, at a press conference in Lebanon on Thursday, said the situation has taken a turn for the worse with 19 people now sitting on death row, renewed reports of torture in detention and military courts now trying civilians. 
In January 2017 Bahrain executed three Shi'ite men convicted of killing three policemen in a 2014 bomb attack. They were the first such executions in over two decades, and sparked protests.
Bahrain is due to hold parliamentary elections in 2018. 
The activists also said they have concerning new information about the health of detained prominent rights campaigner Nabeel Rajab, and demand he be given access to adequate healthcare. 
""Recently alarming signals have multiplied ... regarding his detention condition,"" said Dimitris Christopoulos, president of human rights organization FIDH, calling for his release. Rajab is FIDH's deputy secretary general. 
Rajab, a leading figure in the 2011 pro-democracy protests, has been in and out of detention since that time. He faces up to 15 years in jail over Twitter statements he made about the war in Yemen. A verdict is expected on Feb. 21. 
""Nabeel is in real danger,"" said Sheikh Maytham Al-Salman from the Bahrain Center for Human Rights.

713,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 02:09PM ET</span>",President Trump plans to visit Britain this year,"LONDON (Reuters) - Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May discussed finalizing the details of the first visit by the U.S. president to Britain later this year after a meeting in Davos on Thursday, May's office said.
More than a year into his presidency, Trump has yet to visit London and many British voters have promised that if he comes to Britain they would protest against a man they see as opposed to their values on a range of issues.
Trump's cancellation of a trip to Britain this month had raised questions in Britain over the relationship between Washington and its traditionally closest ally in Europe.
The two leaders met at the World Economic Forum and they discussed Brexit, Iran, and worries that jobs could be lost at Canadian plane-maker Bombardier's factory in Northern Ireland due to a trade dispute with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.
""The PM and president concluded by asking officials to work together on finalizing the details of a visit by the president to the UK later this year,"" according to a statement from May's office.
The statement did not say whether it would be a normal visit or the state visit offered to Trump when May visited him in Washington shortly after his inauguration last year.
Britain is keen to reinforce its ""special relationship"" with the United States as May's government prepares to leave the European Union, a divorce that will shape the country’s standing in the world.
Earlier this month, Trump canceled a trip to London to open a new U.S. embassy in another sign of strained relations with one of the closest U.S. allies.
Trump said he canceled the visit because he did not want to endorse a bad deal agreed by the previous administration of Barack Obama to sell the old embassy in the upmarket Mayfair area for ""peanuts"".
May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his inauguration last January and was filmed emerging from the White House holding hands, but a series of disagreement have since occurred.
British officials have been dismayed by some of Trump's pronouncements, particularly a proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States and most recently when Trump rebuked May on Twitter after she criticized him for retweeting British far-right anti-Islam videos.
Before the pair's talks, May said Britain's relationship with the United States is as strong as it ever has been. 
But Jo Swinson, the deputy leader of Britain's Liberal Democratic Party, predicted Trump's arrival will prompt protests.

""Trump is a dangerous, misogynistic racist and is deserving of the protests he will undoubtedly face,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department's internal watchdog said Thursday it recovered five months of missing text messages between two Federal Bureau of Investigation officials whom Republicans have accused of bias against President Donald Trump.
In a letter to several key Republican lawmakers, Inspector General Michael Horowitz said he would not object if the Justice Department shares with congressional committees the messages between FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page that were recovered using forensic tools. 
In texts that were previously released to Congress, Strzok and Page referred to Trump as an ""idiot"" and a ""loathsome human."" After news reports about the messages, lawmakers demanded to see them amid Republican concerns that agency officials were biased against Trump. 
Strzok and Page both worked on the FBI's investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, and they also each briefly worked on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing probe into whether the 2016 Trump campaign colluded with Russia.
Their cellphones are just two of ""thousands"" whose texts were not backed up and stored on the FBI's systems between Dec. 14, 2016 and May 17, 2017, according to a Justice Department official. 
The FBI has blamed the snafu on ""misconfiguration issues"" that occurred while the bureau was rolling out new software updates for Samsung (KS:005930) 5 devices. 
But Republicans have claimed the timing is suspect, especially because May 17 marks the date that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel.
Strzok and Pages' text messages have become a focal point of congressional Republicans' investigation into whether the FBI is biased against Trump and gave Clinton more favorable treatment in its investigation of her private email use.
Horowitz, whose office is conducting its own review into the FBI's handling of the Clinton matter, discovered the texts over the summer and informed Mueller. Strzok was then reassigned. Page, meanwhile, left the team in July after her 45-day detail ended. 
While Republicans have accused the two of bias against Trump, some of the texts suggest he was just one of many people targeted in their routine political banter.
At times, for instance, they were also critical of Clinton.

In addition, another Strzok text also appears to contradict the notion that the FBI is out to get Trump, after he told Page he was hesitant to join Mueller's team because of his ""gut sense and concern there's no big there there.""

716,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Factbox: Who could run for Venezuela's presidency?,"(Reuters) - Venezuela is to hold a presidential election before April 30, with the ruling socialists hoping to keep power against an opposition whose most popular figures are barred from standing.
The following are confirmed or aspiring candidates:
NICOLAS MADURO
The 55-year-old president and self-described ""son"" of former leader Hugo Chavez is seeking re-election after being in power since 2013. Despite massive opposition protests against him last year, an unprecedented economic crisis, and international sanctions, Maduro has consolidated political power at home and will run for the ruling Socialist Party. The former bus driver and long-serving foreign minister is the favorite to win given his party's political grip on Venezuela, opposition disarray, a complicit national election board and vote-winning state food handouts.
RAFAEL RAMIREZ
The once powerful former oil minister and head of state energy company PDVSA was a major figure throughout Chavez's 1999-2013 rule, but became increasingly estranged from Maduro. After the 54-year-old Ramirez vociferously criticized Maduro's running of Venezuela's economy, they split late last year and he was ordered out of his last government post as U.N. envoy in New York. Ramirez has gone into exile, in an unknown destination, from where he has accused Maduro of betraying ""Chavismo"" and stated he would like to run against him for president. Given that the Venezuelan government has accused him of involvement in a multimillion-dollar corruption scheme, an allegation that Ramirez has denied, it seems impossible that he could run.
HENRI FALCON
The 56-year-old former governor of Lara state, who left the Socialist Party in 2010 to join the opposition, was quick to declare his candidacy after the announcement of the presidential vote. Falcon has long been viewed as someone who could potentially appeal across both sides of Venezuela's political divide. But his defection from the ruling party has led some government loyalists to call him a ""traitor,"" while his socialist roots have also raised suspicions among opposition supporters. The former military man and self-styled center-leftist politician managed the 2013 presidential campaign of opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who narrowly lost to Maduro.
HENRY RAMOS
The pugnacious 74-year-old veteran lawyer and leader of Venezuela's oldest active political party, Democratic Action, has said he wants to run but will also respect primaries to select a unity candidate for the opposition coalition. Knowing he is unpopular among young opposition supporters, Maduro has repeatedly urged Ramos to stand against him. The wily and sharp-talking Ramos commands a powerful party machinery: Democratic Action took the largest number of seats in a 2015 congress vote. Always controversial, a U.S. ambassador once described Ramos as ""abrasive"" and ""arrogant,"" and Maduro has branded him a ""fascist dinosaur.""
ANDRES VELASQUEZ
The 64-year-old former governor of southern Bolivar state and leader of the Radical Cause party is interested in standing for president, but has also said the conditions are not free and fair, and he will wait to see what the opposition coalition decides. The former steel union representative ran for the governorship of Bolivar state again last year, but lost narrowly to a government candidate in what he and supporters say was a clear example of ballot fraud. 
LORENZO MENDOZA
The long-haired, 52-year-old head of Venezuela's largest private business, Polar, is mooted by many as a possible ""outside"" candidate. But he has given no indication of wanting to stand. Venezuelans are generally fond of the Venezuelan company, which produces beer and flour for the national staple 'arepa' cornmeal pancakes, and U.S.-educated Mendoza is widely viewed as a competent business leader. The government, however, has accused him of being part of a capitalist conspiracy and threatened to nationalize Polar facilities as punishment for alleged hoarding and price-gouging. Of late, when he appears in public, crowds have chanted ""presidente, presidente!""
HENRIQUE CAPRILES/LEOPOLDO LOPEZ
Former state governor Henrique Capriles and protest leader Leopoldo Lopez are the most popular opposition leaders, and would both love to run against Maduro. But Capriles, 45, is barred from standing over alleged ""administrative irregularities"" during his running of Miranda state. Lopez, 46, is under house arrest and serving a 15-year sentence on charges of fomenting violence and terrorism. Critics say Maduro has sidelined them because either would beat him easily.

718,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>","U.S. Pacific Northwest under-prepared for tsunamis, experts say","By Sharon Bernstein
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The U.S. region most vulnerable to tsunamis - the massive waves of water unleashed by undersea earthquakes - is dangerously under-prepared, experts and officials in Oregon and Washington state said after a magnitude 7.9 earthquake this week.
The quake that struck in the Gulf of Alaska late Monday, triggering a tsunami warning for Alaska and a tsunami watch for the U.S. West Coast, rekindled concerns that a seismic sea wave along the northwest coast could kill, injure or displace tens of thousands of people and cause billions of dollars in damage.
In this week's quake, the warnings and watches were quickly lifted, and there was no damage from the slight change it caused in the ocean.
But experts worry that in some parts of the region there is too little information about where tsunamis might occur, and in others too much infrastructure built in locations known to face a threat.
""There's still a lot that needs to be done,"" said Corina Forson, Washington's chief hazards geologist. 
Scientists in the state have pinpointed just half the locations where a destructive tsunami triggered by the Cascadia subduction zone off the northwest coast might come ashore, and about 10 percent of sites that might be hit by a wave emanating from the Seattle fault zone, Forson said.
She called the lack of information dangerous. A tsunami could send a wall of water 50 feet (15 meters) high crashing onto the coast, or a wave 16 feet (5 meters) high into Seattle, the state's largest city, she said. 
""If there's the real thing and people don't have evacuation routes and plans, they won't know where to get to safety and it could be life-threatening,"" she said.
In neighboring Oregon, officials have created evacuation plans and public awareness campaigns to help people prepare. But the state has not done enough to stop people from building in potential danger zones, said Jay Wilson, former chairman of the Oregon Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission.
""There are about 30,000 people who live in the tsunami zones,"" Wilson said. ""If we do everything right, they're going to run up to the top of the hill. And then they're all going to be permanently displaced.""
DEADLY THREAT
Parts of Oregon and far northern California have up to a 37 percent chance of a tsunami from a rupture of the Cascadia subduction zone in the next 50 years, said Chris Goldfinger, a tsunami and earthquake expert with the Oregon State University. 
Tsunamis are generally produced when tectonic plates move against each other under the ocean in subduction zones, displacing ocean water through powerful quakes.
They have a deadly history. The 2011 quake and tsunami in Japan killed up to 18,000 people and wrecked Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant, causing the worst meltdown since the Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union. The 2004 Asian tsunami killed 226,000 people.
A big tsunami on the Oregon coast could kill up to 10,000 people, said Althea Rizzo, the state's geologic hazards program coordinator. 
In recent years, Oregon has instituted practice drills at schools and hospitals, provided evacuation materials to tourists in their hotel rooms and in some areas painted blue evacuation lines to higher ground on roads and paths, Rizzo said.
The city of Seaside, Oregon, voted in 2016 to fund a bond measure to move its schools out of the inundation zone. 
There are statewide restrictions on building essential facilities like hospitals in tsunami zones. But updated maps showing where those zones are located have not been incorporated into the law, meaning the restrictions might not apply in areas that are now known to be dangerous, Wilson said. 
""In the Northwest our biggest problem is not getting the word out, it's that our built infrastructure is very vulnerable,"" said Goldfinger. ""Buildings within a tsunami zone are pretty much going to be destroyed.""
California is considering adopting international zoning standards for tsunami zone construction, as well as ""blue line"" evacuation routes like those in Oregon, said Rick Wilson, senior engineering geologist for the California Geological Survey.
In Manzanita on the Oregon coast, resident Kerry Driscoll said she has an evacuation plan and the cabins at the beachside resort where she works are equipped with pamphlets telling tourists how to prepare.
But tsunamis can come with little warning, and she knows it might be hard to get out.

""If we don’t have major advance warning I don’t think there’s much that we can do,"" Driscoll said. ""I can’t see running from giant tidal waves.""

719,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",EU signals some flexibility on Brexit transition,"By Jan Strupczewski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is willing to be flexible on the duration and other terms of a Brexit transition period, EU diplomats said as Britain prepares to detail its hopes for what happens after it leaves the bloc in March 2019.
A document to be formally endorsed by EU ministers on Monday and seen by Reuters confirmed a readiness to amend a period set to last just 21 months, to consider letting London sign trade deals with other countries around the world before 2021, and to launch new EU-British partnerships in areas like security and defense before waiting for the transition period to end.
Britain's Brexit Secretary David Davis is expected to spell out on Friday London's aims for the next round of negotiation with Brussels, which both sides want to result in a provisional agreement by March that will ease business concerns about what will happen once Britain is out of the EU on March 30, 2019.
Since striking an interim accord a month ago under which Britain agreed to settle tens of billions of euros of financial commitments to Brussels and guarantee rights for EU citizens living there, the other 27 EU states agreed among themselves a set of conditions for a transition that will largely preserve the status quo until December 2020 but deny Britain any say.
Britain has raised little public objection to terms that include insisting that even EU citizens who arrive in Britain after Brexit - but before the end of the transition - will be entitled to residence rights for life.
Davis may give more indication of Britain's position on Friday. He is expected to resume regular negotiating rounds in Brussels once EU ministers confirm their instruction to his EU counterpart Michel Barnier on Monday.
However, Davis may also repeat his exhortation to hardline Brexit supporters in Britain to ease off on criticism of the fact that the country will remain bound by essentially all EU rules, including on immigration and the supremacy of EU courts, for nearly two years after Brexit.
Earlier this week he dismissed a suggestion that Britain would be a ""vassal state"" and urged critics to focus on the opportunities of a future, looser relationship.
DOCUMENT
An annex to the negotiating directives to be agreed by ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday, seen by Reuters, includes statements by the other 27 governments of three areas in which they are willing to consider flexibility:
First, on forging new security and defense partnerships without waiting for the transition to end; second, to update the directives depending on progress - a line that diplomats said meant that Britain would not necessarily be shoved off a ""cliff edge"" in 2021 if a new trade agreement was not ready; and third, that they might agree to let Britain sign new trade deals with others, despite being bound by EU trade rules in the transition.
The annex also contained a statement by the EU executive, the Commission, pledging to set out clear and consistent rules for Britain's occasional non-voting participation in some EU meetings during the transition when its interests are at stake.
Some British politicians have voiced disquiet that the EU might take advantage of the transition to force Britain into damaging situations. However, EU officials note that EU texts agreed last year spell out that both sides will be bound by a principle of ""sincere cooperation"" while bound by EU treaties.
At the same time, however, EU officials have said this month that they are taking seriously their obligation to pursue the best interests of the 27 continuing member states and are looking at how existing relationships across the range of EU activities could be changed to the EU's advantage after Brexit.

720,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",U.S. dismisses Pakistani assertion that American missiles hit Afghan refugees,"By Asif Shahzad
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday dismissed a Pakistani allegation that an American drone had fired missiles at an Afghan refugee camp in Kurram district, in the lawless regions bordering Afghanistan.
At the same time, Pakistani security officials who sought anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the information said the drone strike had killed two members of the militant Haqqani network, which is allied with the Afghan Taliban.
Although allies in the war against Islamist militants, the two countries are currently at loggerheads after Washington suspended nearly $2 billion of aid, accusing Islamabad of supporting Taliban militants wreaking havoc in Afghanistan. 
""The claim in an MFA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) statement yesterday that U.S. forces struck an Afghan refugee camp in Kurram Agency yesterday is false,"" a U.S. embassy spokesman in Islamabad said in a statement.
It did not deny that a drone strike had taken place, however, and the comment from security officials suggested that it had hit its intended target.
Pakistan rejects American accusations that it is supporting and sheltering Haqqani militants using bases inside Pakistan to prepare attacks on U.S. and allied NATO forces in Afghanistan. 
President Donald Trump has accused Islamabad in a tweet of ""lies and deceit"". Pakistan denies the allegations, saying that Washington has been trying to make it a scapegoat for the failures of its war in Afghanistan.
In the meantime, to Pakistan's annoyance, the United States continues its drone campaign against militants in mountainous border regions bordering Afghanistan where government control is limited.
Since Trump took office a year ago, these drone strikes have increased, though they are a long way off their peak of 2010.
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry on Thursday reiterated its position that ""unilateral actions are detrimental to the spirit of cooperation between the two countries in the fight against terrorism"".
The army said the strike had not eliminated any ""organized terrorist sanctuary"" but ""struck individual target who had morphed into Afghan refugees"", without specifying who exactly it believed had been hit.
The army said 43 of Pakistan's 54 Afghan refugee camps were in the northwest, and that it was essential that their inhabitants be repatriated. It said the incident vindicated Pakistan's stance that the militants could easily blend in with the refugees.
Pakistan is home to nearly 2 million registered Afghan refugees and another 1 million unregistered ones, displaced by decades of war in their country.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's right-wing government said on Thursday it had no tolerance for neo-fascism, after opposition lawmakers charged that its nationalist, eurosceptic focus was helping to reinvigorate the far right.
The issue has dominated local media since the commercial television station TVN showed on Saturday a far-right organization - officially registered since 2011 - secretly celebrating Adolf Hitler's 128th birthday in a Polish forest last April.
Filmed with a hidden camera, the footage showed members of the group dressed in Nazi uniforms, burning a wooden swastika, making Nazi salutes and sharing a cake with a symbol of a swastika made of chocolate cookies.
The same group, called ""Pride and Modernity"" (DiN), hanged portraits of opposition lawmakers in November, after the lawmakers backed a European Parliament resolution calling on the Polish government to reverse its overhaul of the judiciary and condemn a ""fascist march"" held earlier that month in Warsaw.
""There is zero tolerance for any displays of promoting, affirmation, glorifying of criminal totalitarian regimes,"" Interior Minister Joachim Brudzinski said in parliament on Thursday. 
""The fact that such creeps have to hide in a forest is a success of our whole society,"" he said, adding authorities would seek to ban the organization and prosecute its members. 
The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has walked a thin line with right-wing groups. It fears the emergence of a rival further to the right, but it does not want to alienate more centrist voters.
It condemned displays of racism and anti-Semitism organized by far-right groups at a November march, for example, but it did not condemn the march itself, saying most of the marchers were ""patriots"". 
Opposition lawmaker Slawomir Nitras, a member of the centrist Civic Platform (PO), which lost power to PiS in 2015, accused the government on Thursday of emboldening the far-right.
One example given by opposition lawmakers was that the prosecutor's office, brought under direct government control by PiS, has appealed the conviction of a man who burned a Jewish effigy in Wroclaw in 2015. 
""You are spreading hate, downplaying the problem, feeding the monster that has now grown,"" said lawmaker Katarzyna Lubnauer from the Nowoczesna party. ""Now, full of hypocrisy, you are pretending that you fight this."" 
Spreading totalitarian ideologies like Nazism or communism is punishable by jail in Poland, a country that was invaded both by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during World War Two, then dominated by the Soviets after the war.

BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's Workers Party and labor leaders insisted on Thursday that left-wing hero Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva would be their candidate in this year's presidential race, despite his failure to overturn a corruption conviction that will likely bar him.
Political observers expect the Workers Party to back his candidacy for as long as it possibly can, as without the charismatic Lula on the campaign trail Brazil's second largest party in Congress faces oblivion.
""We are here to reaffirm Lula's candidacy for president of Brazil. We have no Plan B. He will be our candidate,"" party leader Senator Gleisi Hoffmann said at the country's largest labor union headquarters.
The two-term former president, while popular, has slim chances of undoing Wednesday's ruling by an appellate court. His exclusion raises the prospect of a right-leaning reformer winning the Oct. 7 election and sticking to Brazil's austerity program.
Investors are betting it is game over for Brazil's most influential politician and early front-runner. Sao Paulo's stock market hit a new high after the decision and the currency strengthened from 3.20 to 3.14 reais to the dollar.
But Lula accepted the Workers Party nomination, which has to be formalized at a party convention, and told a rally in Sao Paulo that he would ""fight to the end"" to appeal against his conviction.
""I want to be candidate to win the elections and govern this country,"" he said to a crowd that chanted ""Lula for president.""
Workers Party leaders called for a civil disobedience campaign to oppose his exclusion from the elections and said they would resist any move to arrest Lula, whose prison sentence was increased by the appeals court from nine to 12 years.
""We need social confrontation to stop this coup. There has to be a rebellion by citizens,"" said firebrand Workers Party Senator Lindbergh Farias. 
With doubts about his ability to run, other parties will be reluctant to ally themselves with the PT, which could eventually be forced to back another candidate.
""The 3-0 vote to condemn him and the increase in his sentence was a definitive shock to Lula's political life. It ends it,"" said Sergio Praça, a political scientist at FGV think tank in Sao Paulo.
NOBODY LEFT ON THE LEFT
The exclusion of Lula from the 2018 election would not only leave the Workers Party orphaned but also the Brazilian left.
""There is nobody else on the left with a real chance for victory, and certainly nobody from the Workers Party,"" Praça said. ""There is nobody left on the left.""
Still, some analysts said Lula, while down after the court verdict, was not entirely out, with consultancy Eurasia saying he has a roughly one-third chance of being able to run.
If Lula is ruled out, his party could ally itself with the center-left Democratic Labor Party (PDT), which stands to gain leftist backers for its candidate Ciro Gomes, a former governor of Ceará state.
Another left-of-center option is environmentalist Marina Silva, who has won more than 20 percent of the votes in the last two presidential elections on an anti-corruption platform. 
But she publicly supported the conviction of Lula for taking a bribe and his party is unlikely to join forces with her.
The absence of Lula on the campaign trail is not expected to benefit far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, running second in polling and whose support is in part based on a fear of a Workers Party return to power. 
Instead it may open the field for more right of center candidates with clear market-friendly stances.
The strongest contender at this point is Sao Paulo governor Geraldo Alckmin, president of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB), the country's third largest party which privatized state companies in the 1990s and would continue that policy.
Other potential candidates jockeying for position before the race kicks off are lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia and Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles, a former banking executive and architect of Brazil's economic recovery plan. 
Maia is a staunch backer of Meirelles' efforts to overhaul Brazil's costly social security system, the main cause of Brazil's budget deficit, and both would ensure pension reform was completed if elected.

Danny Lavon Burch, who works for the Yemeni Safer oil company and is married to a Yemeni citizen, was detained in Sanaa after taking his children to school, according to two colleagues.
Sources at former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh's General People's Congress party in Sanaa said Burch was accompanied to Muscat by Mohammed Abdel-Salam, a senior Houthi leader.
Abdel-Salam led Houthi negotiators in failed peace talks with representatives of the internationally-recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, according to the report which was confirmed by a source close to the Houthis.
A Houthi spokesman could not immediately be reached for a comment on the report and U.S. officials were also not available for comment.
Yemeni officials said this week that Houthis officials were due in Muscat soon for a fresh bid to try to restart U.N.-sponsored peace talks held in Kuwait in 2016 but ended without an agreement.
Hadi's government, backed by a Saudi-led Arab coalition, have been fighting the Houthis who had seized most of northern Yemen in a series of military operations that began in 2014, but little territory has changed hands since then.

The area is home to separatist rebels who in 1982 formed the Movement of Democratic Forces for Casamance (MFDC), now one of Africa's oldest rebellions, fighting for independence.
Abdoulaye Sylla, a prosecutor in the provincial capital Ziguinchor, told national radio that the 24 arrested included a member of the MDFC who authorities believe was the mastermind behind the operation. 
Sylla said the 24 were charged with murder, criminal conspiracy and possession of unlicensed weapons.

The European Research Group, led by hardline Brexit campaigner Jacob Rees-Mogg after both his predecessors were brought into the government's Brexit department, has influence over several dozen Conservative lawmakers and ministers.
The direct appeal to May and her government breaks with tradition, and follows criticism by Rees-Mogg on Wednesday that Brexit minister David Davis was helping make Britain a ""vassal state"" of the EU by agreeing to a status quo transition.
""If (Brexit's opportunities are) taken off the table then Brexit becomes only a damage limitation exercise. The British people did not vote for that ... They voted for hope and opportunity and politicians must now deliver it,"" Rees-Mogg said in a speech he will deliver at an English independent school.
""There is a great Brexit opportunity and some really obvious benefits that we can get that improve the condition of the people. This is currently at risk.""
A spokesman for May told reporters the prime minister had set out a ""positive vision for the UK post-Brexit"" and was confident of securing that.
Rees-Mogg is one of many in the Brexit campaign voicing concern that the referendum result may be betrayed. Some supporters have started to get ready for a fightback against what they call ""ultra-Remainers"" who they accuse of trying to stop the divorce.
After the EU agreed its negotiating directives on Wednesday, the Conservative lawmaker listed his red lines for the Brexit talks which will enter a crucial phase later this year when the two sides start negotiating their future relationship.
He said Britain could not stay in the EU's customs union or hold closely to the bloc's rules and regulations. 
May has repeatedly said Britain will leave the bloc's single market and customs union, but Brexit campaigners fear that after negotiating a transition deal that changes little, she may opt for a future relationship along those lines.

Rees-Mogg urged British negotiators to stop being ""cowed by the EU"". ""Their approach seems to be that we must accept what the EU will allow us to do and build from there. This is no way to negotiate and it is no way for this country to behave.""

""The meeting was good,"" the head of the Syrian government delegation, Bashar al-Ja'afari, told Reuters as he left the U.N. offices in Vienna in the afternoon after talks with U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura. He declined to elaborate.
An opposition delegation arrived shortly before he left, but there was no sign the warring sides met.
Previous rounds of U.N.-sponsored talks have made little progress while Syrian government forces backed by Russia and Iran have gained ground, recovering swathes of the country from rebel fighters.
Government forces have mounted offensives against two remaining rebel pockets, Idlib in the northwest and eastern Ghouta near Damascus. Turkey has also poured troops into the north to fight Kurdish militias that have established regional autonomy and are seen by Ankara as a menace to its security. 
Having regained the upper hand in the almost seven-year-old civil war, President Bashar al-Assad appears far from ready to negotiate with his enemies at all, let alone step down as part of any peaceful solution as rebel groups have demanded.
Few expect a breakthrough at these two-days talks aimed at addressing issues related to a new constitution, but de Mistura, has continued to express optimism.
""It's a very critical moment. Very, very critical,"" he said on Wednesday. 
In eight rounds of talks before this week's, de Mistura has not managed to coax the two sides into speaking face to face, and it was only at the last round in December that the rebel opposition united in one delegation, raising modest hopes for direct talks.
Russia, Turkey and Iran convened eight Syria meetings in Astana last year, with the stated aim of agreeing ""de-escalation"" zones to ease hostilities in western Syria where the three states wield influence.
The Sochi peace congress was announced after their last meeting in December. De Mistura has acknowledged the Sochi congress but it remains unclear how he plans to address it. 
Western and some Arab states believe that Moscow's initiative would lay groundwork for a solution more favorable to the government in Damascus and its allies.
The opposition will decide in the next two days whether to attend Sochi, its chief negotiator Nasr Hariri, said on Wednesday. He said the talks would be a test of all sides' commitment to a political solution rather than a military one.
Previous rounds have taken place sporadically in Geneva, with a mandate to discuss new elections, reformed governance, a new constitution and the fight against terrorism.
At the last round in December, the Syrian government delegation objected to the opposition's tough line on the future of Assad, and those talks achieved nothing.

728,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",ANC leader says South Africa in new era as talk of Zuma exit grows,"By Alexander Winning and Alexis Akwagyiram
JOHANNESBURG/DAVOS (Reuters) - The new leader of South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) said on Thursday the country had entered a new era under his leadership, in a fresh sign that Jacob Zuma's days as president are numbered.
Cyril Ramaphosa's declaration reflects the party's desire to win back the trust of investors and convince voters ahead of next year's election that it can boost the economy.
But above all it shows the ANC wants to overcome the taint of corruption it acquired since Zuma became president in 2009.
""We are in a new era. We had an old leadership of the ANC, we now have a new leadership of the ANC,"" Ramaphosa said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he was leading South Africa's delegation.
""Many of the business leaders that I have met here have said they are buoyed by this new mood in the country,"" he said.
Zuma, 75, has seen a reversal of fortune since deputy president Ramaphosa succeeded him as ANC leader last month.
Loyalists have deserted him in droves and the party is discussing whether to force him to resign as head of state before his second term ends next year.
ANC sources differ on the timing of Zuma's exit, and estimates range from several weeks to months.
The ANC has held power under three different leaders since the end of apartheid in 1994, but the party's electoral dominance is shrinking, making Ramaphosa's task more urgent. 
He now controls the party's National Executive Committee, which can instruct Zuma to resign. If Zuma refuses, the ANC could threaten a no-confidence vote in parliament that Zuma would likely lose.
""This is the end of the Zuma era,"" said Melanie Verwoerd, a political analyst and former ANC lawmaker. ""Things are unraveling very quickly but the bottom line is that Ramaphosa is in charge.""
SHARK-INFESTED WATERS
This month, leading cartoonist Zapiro depicted Zuma being made to walk the plank over shark-infested waters as ANC cadres stood on the deck, pistols drawn.
""The majority view on the NEC is that Zuma must go,"" a senior ANC source allied to Ramaphosa told Reuters. ""The top officials are talking to Zuma about options for his exit. I can't see this matter going beyond March.""
A source aligned with Zuma's faction in the ANC said that timeframe was too tight. ""ANC officials have only started to engage on the matter,"" the source said.
Zuma has not said whether he will step down and his spokesman did not return calls seeking comment.
Zuma has survived corruption charges, a rape accusation and street protests. He chuckled in parliament when opposition lawmakers asked why public money had been used to renovate his Nkandla home but he now faces a tougher battle.
""Zuma should step down,"" said Sdumo Dlamini, president of trade union federation COSATU, which is an important ANC ally.
Some analysts say Zuma is holding out for a deal to protect him from prosecution after he resigns. But South African law does not grant such immunity.

""Zuma will try to hold out for as long as he can but his exit is inevitable,"" said Darias Jonker, director for Africa at Eurasia Group. ""I don't see Ramaphosa taking his foot off the gas.""

729,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Two more lawmakers mull joining legal case to show UK can stop Brexit alone,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Two more lawmakers in Britain's national parliament are considering joining a legal case seeking to show that Britain can, if it chooses, alone change its mind on Brexit, intensifying its potential political scope.
Labour's Chris Leslie, along with Liberal Democrat lawmaker Tom Brake, want to add their names to Scottish litigation aimed at showing that Britain can, if the case arises, reverse its decision to leave the world's biggest trading bloc.
The petition, filed in Scotland's Court of Session, its supreme civil court, will determine whether Britain can act to rejoin without depending on the bloc's other 27 members.
Two other national lawmakers are already on the petition, along with three Members of the European Parliament and two members of the devolved Scottish parliament.
""We are taking legal advice and reflecting on whether it would be appropriate for us to seek the permission of the (Scottish) Court to participate in these proceedings,"" Leslie and Brake said in a joint letter addressed to Britain's Brexit minister David Davis obtained by Reuters. 
They will make a final decision when the Court of Session decides on whether to open a formal hearing in the coming week, they said. Once that decision is made, they will seek further backing for the litigation from other British lawmakers, Brake told Reuters.
Brexit will break a 4-decade trading relationship with the EU and has divided British politics across party lines. Supporters argue that after 2016's referendum vote to leave, any attempt to halt the process would be anti-democratic. 
But opponents say the country should have a right to pass final judgment on any exit deal negotiated, and the Scottish litigation is the latest attempt to try to make this happen.
Prime Minister Theresa May formally notified the EU of Britain's intention to leave by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on March 29 last year, starting a two-year exit process.
Article 50 does not specify whether exit can be unilaterally reversed although former British diplomat Lord Kerr, who drafted it, has said Britain can change its mind at any stage before the final exit date in 2019.
May has said she will not tolerate any attempt in parliament to block Brexit. But British lawmakers defied the government in December by voting against May's wishes and securing parliament a much more substantial say on whether to accept the final deal with the EU.

The Court of Session is expected to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice, the EU's highest court, to conclusively rule on the issue.

731,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>","Austria investigating bugging, break-in at far-right leader's office","VIENNA (Reuters) - The office of Austrian far-right leader and vice chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache was broken into this week, shortly after bugging devices were discovered there, and a criminal inquiry has been launched, prosecutors said on Thursday.
The break-in occurred on Wednesday night while Strache, whose Freedom Party entered the governing coalition after elections in October, was out for dinner, his spokesman said, confirming an earlier report by broadcaster Oe24.
The spokesman said the electronic surveillance devices had been discovered last week behind a mirrored wall by intelligence service specialists. ""This was a routine check after moving into a new office,"" he said. 
Strache, who has vowed to fight political Islam, moved into his office at the baroque Palais Dietrichstein after joining the government a month ago.
""We have launched an investigation and are waiting for a police report,"" a spokeswoman for Vienna prosecutors said. The motive for the bugging devices and break-in were not yet known, according to the FPO-run interior ministry.
The revelations coincided with a scandal involving the Freedom Party's leadership candidate, Udo Landbauer, in elections in the province of Lower Austria. Landbauer suspended his membership of a student fraternity he helped lead when it emerged the group had distributed song books with Nazi content.
The Freedom Party (FPO), junior coalition partner to Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservatives, was founded by former Nazis in the 1950s and has repeatedly kicked out members for neo-Nazi or anti-Semitic sentiments. 
The FPO says it has left its Nazi past behind. 
Austria's main Jewish community body (IKG) said earlier on Thursday that it would boycott a parliamentary Holocaust commemoration event because of the FPO's presence in government. 
On Friday, thousands of people were expected to stage a protest against a far right ball hosted by the FPO in Vienna's imperial-era Hofburg Palace.

The coalition deal handed control of much of Austria's security apparatus to the FPO, which came third in October's parliamentary election with 26 percent of the vote.

732,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Ship that took Russian fuel to North Korea hit by U.S. sanctions,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States has imposed sanctions on a vessel that Reuters revealed last year was delivering oil products from Russia to North Korea.
The vessel, the Kum Un San, was one of eight vessels which Reuters found had left Russia with cargoes of fuel headed for North Korea despite declaring other destinations. U.S. officials say that is a ploy often used to skirt sanctions.
The North Korean-flagged Kum Un San, as well as the company that owned it, Korea Kumunsan Shipping Co, were among six vessels, nine entities and sixteen individuals sanctioned on Wednesday by the U.S. Treasury Department.
""Treasury continues to systematically target individuals and entities financing the Kim (Jong-un) regime (in North Korea) and its weapons programs, including officials complicit in North Korean sanctions evasion schemes,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin was quoted as saying in a statement announcing the new measures. 
""We are sanctioning additional oil, shipping, and trading companies that continue to provide a lifeline to North Korea to fuel this regime's nuclear ambitions and destabilizing activities."" 
North Korea, which has no oil reserves, needs to import fuel to keep its struggling economy functioning. The United Nations tightened sanctions against Pyongyang on Sept. 11 last year, reducing the amount of fuel that can be sold to it. That has led to added scrutiny on oil supplies to North Korea, especially from neighboring countries.
According to the Russian Information System for State Port Control, the Kum Un San put into the Vostochny port on Russia's Pacific coast on March 18, 2017 and loaded up with 2,100 tonnes of oil products.
It left Vostochny on March 23 and, according to port documents, gave the port of Dalian in China as its next destination. But Reuters ship-tracking data soon detected the vessel near the North Korean port of Chongjin.
After this journey it made only one port call in Russia on May 25, to the port of Vladivostok where it took on fuel for its own use but did not load or unload any cargo, according to the Russian Information System for State Port Control.
The Kum Un San's transponder has been turned off since the end of June, Reuters ship-tracking data shows, apart from a few brief periods. U.S officials say vessels often switch off transmitters to undermine sanctions.
U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Reuters last week that Russia was helping North Korea evade international sanctions and was probably helping supply Pyongyang with anything that China had stopped giving it. Moscow rejected allegations that it is in breach of U.N. sanctions on North Korea.

The bill would give authorities new powers to monitor citizens online and allow the intelligence service to track communications beyond Finland's borders.
It requires changes to the constitutional law on privacy protection and fast-track approval, which is rare, demands the backing of five-sixths of parliament.
""The weakening of Finland's security situation and the need to prepare for activities threatening the national security of Finland have created an exceptional situation in which there is an immediate need to urgently amend the constitution,"" the government said in a statement.
Two people were killed and eight wounded in an August knife attack by a suspected Moroccan asylum seeker. A trial is expected to start in the coming weeks.
Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo) also last year raised its threat level to ""elevated"" from ""low"".
If the bill fails to reach the required majority, the constitutional changes would also need the approval of a new parliament following next year's general election.
""For too long, we have lagged behind other Western countries with our intelligence legislation, so there's no need to drag this out,"" defense minister Jussi Niinisto told a news conference.
""From what I've heard from other parties, the laws are deemed necessary ... so we should enact them as soon as possible, before the country faces a serious security threat.""
The governing coalition controls 105 seats in parliament and needs the support of the 35 lawmakers in the opposition to reach the necessary 166 votes.
The bill aims to also boost powers for military intelligence and establish a new authority and a parliamentary committee to oversee intelligence operations.
The lawmakers are expected to vote on the bill in the spring after a review by a parliament committee overseeing constitutional law.

The country's Securities and Exchange Commission revoked Rappler's license on Jan 11 for ownership violations. Maria Ressa, chief of Rappler, met state investigators on Monday to answer what she called a suspicious complaint about a 2012 story.
""We are gravely concerned that the government is moving to revoke Rappler’s license,"" three U.N. human rights experts said in a joint statement. ""We are especially concerned that this move against Rappler comes at a time of rising rhetoric against independent voices in the country.""
The Philippines authorities deny Rappler is being punished, but say it broke the law in 2015 by granting American investor Omidyar Network the means to exercise control over the news site, or veto powers on company decisions. 
Rappler, which continues to operate normally pending an appeal denies it broke the law.
""Rappler’s work rests on its own freedom to impart information, and more importantly its vast readership to have access to its public interest reporting,” the U.N. experts said.
There was no basis under international human rights law to block Rappler from operating, they said: ""Rappler and other independent outlets need particular protection because of the essential role they play in ensuring robust public debate.""
Diplomats at the Philippines mission in Geneva were not immediately available to comment on the statement, which was issued by David Kaye, U.N. special rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Michel Forst, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights defenders, and Agnes Callamard, U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions.

India is hosting the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Regional Cooperation (ASEAN) and the summit comes at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pursuing an ""Act East"" policy of developing ties with these countries.
The Indian and ASEAN leaders agreed ""to establish a mechanism for greater cooperation in the maritime domain sector"", Preeti Saran, secretary in the Indian foreign ministry, told reporters.
""They did discuss the issues of greater maritime cooperation, addressing both traditional and non-traditional challenges all of us face collectively,"" Saran said, without elaborating.
In the talks Modi also pitched for an ASEAN-India women's navy team which could sail around the world, just as an Indian team is doing currently, Saran said.
Modi has invited the leaders of all 10 ASEAN nations to join him for India's Republic Day celebrations on Friday in the biggest ever gathering of foreign leaders at the parade, which showcases the country's military might and cultural diversity.
The leaders attending the summit in New Delhi include Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. 
New Delhi's push to expand economic ties with southeast Asia still trail those of China, whose trade with ASEAN was more than six times greater than India's in 2016-17 at $470 million.
China has in recent years also built ports and power plants in countries around India's periphery, expanding its presence in South Asia and pushing New Delhi to seek new allies.
Modi said he would work toward strengthening relations with ASEAN countries, saying trade had already grown ""25 times in 25 years"".

""Investments are robust and growing. We will further enhance trade ties and work towards greater interaction among our business communities,"" Modi said.

736,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 10:51AM ET</span>",South Korea minister says military option 'unacceptable' on North Korea crisis,"By Soyoung Kim
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - South Korea's foreign minister said on Thursday the standoff over North Korea's nuclear programme must be resolved diplomatically, and she was certain Washington would consult her government first if a military option were to be considered.
""The nuclear issue has to be solved through negotiations and diplomatic endeavours. This idea of a military solution is unacceptable,"" Kang Kyung-wha said at a news briefing on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
The Trump administration has said all options are on the table in dealing with North Korea, and officials say the president and his advisers have discussed the possibility of a limited strike. But debate on military options has lost some momentum in recent weeks after North and South Korea resumed talks ahead of next month's Winter Olympics in the South.
""I'm assured that anything the U.S. administration does on this front is done in close consultation with us,"" Kang said.
She declined to comment if Washington had given Seoul clear assurance but added: ""This is our fate that is at stake. Any option that is to be taken on the Korean peninsula, cannot be implemented without us going along.""
In an earlier interview with Reuters, Kang said South Korea was prepared for ""all contingency scenarios"" in case North Korea stages another weapons test, even as the two countries conduct talks and mutual visits relating to the Olympics.
""We go into these discussions with a clear understanding of what might be possible,"" Kang said, adding, ""another provocation is always a possibility.""
Kang, who was in Davos to discuss recent progress in inter-Korean talks and to boost awareness of the Olympics, did not discuss details of the scenarios that South Korea was prepared for.
OLYMPICS
After their first formal talks in more than two years this month, officials from the two Koreas have been visiting each other to facilitate the North's participation in the Olympics, to be held in the South's alpine resort town of Pyeongchang. 
North Korea has waged a publicity campaign around its attendance, calling on Thursday for ""all Koreans at home and abroad"" to promote inter-Korean cooperation.
Kim Jong Un's regime has also set a new anniversary to mark the formation of its military on Feb. 8 - the day before the start of the Games - and analysts say the nation may observe the day with a large military parade.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who will represent the United States at the Olympics, said on Tuesday he would seek to counter what he described as an effort by North Korea to ""hijack"" the Games with a propaganda campaign. 
Seoul has rejected that criticism, saying the Olympics will help defuse tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes.
""This is an opportunity for engagement and a peaceful engagement around the Olympic Games, and we just need to make the best of it,"" Kang said in the interview on Wednesday.
But she cautioned that sustained improvement in bilateral ties cannot take place apart from the nuclear issue: ""There have to be advances on this front as well.""
MISSILE LAUNCHES
Last year, North Korea conducted dozens of missile launches and its sixth and largest nuclear test, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, as it raced towards its goal of developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States.
Another test or similar provocation ""would be not acceptable,"" Kang said. ""And further provocations will only lead to further pressure and sanctions"".
Kang said she was ""very disappointed"" with the U.S. government's decision this week to impose steep tariffs on washing machines imported from South Korea, but said that the trade dispute should not affect a ""very strong security alliance"" between the two countries.
With the North joining the Games, South Korea's liberal President Moon Jae-in tackled his immediate goal of curbing tensions and reopening cross-border dialogue. 
But analysts say turning the thaw into a longer-term detente will be far more daunting, as the North rejected discussing its nuclear weapons programme with the South in earlier talks. 
""The period of non-engagement with North Korea has been too long,"" Kang said, hoping that discussions ""will create the momentum for dialogue on the North Korean nuclear issue as well."" 
'REHEARSAL FOR WAR'
In an apparent bid to court the North, which describes joint South Korea-U.S. military exercises as a ""rehearsal for war,"" Seoul had proposed a delay in the drills during the Olympics. 
The proposal was based on the ""spirit of the Olympic Games,"" Kang said, but declined to elaborate on whether the South would resume the drills after the event. 
""We're on the same page on all fronts (with the United States),"" she said. ""So we will see how the next two months will unfold.""
China and Russia can ""do more"" to improve the enforcement of the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) sanctions against North Korea in areas such as the interdiction of ships suspected of conducting illegal transfers of oil and coal at sea, she said. 
The U.S. Treasury on Wednesday blacklisted nine entities, 16 people and six North Korean vessels it accused of helping the North's weapons programmes.
""This is now mandatory by the latest UNSC resolution, if you have information that illicit transfers are being done ship-to-ship, that's a clear violation and you have to stop that,"" Kang said. 

""China and Russia are members of the Security Council - they have in fact the primary responsibility to see their decisions on the sanctions are implemented.""

The crash took place between a bus carrying 45 school students and five adults, and another small vehicle. Emergency services were on the scene, the prefecture said.

The vehicle had crossed the volatile border with neighbouring Burkina Faso, where militants loyal to Islamic State are known to operate, when it ran over the mine, Malian army spokesman Colonel Diarran Kone said by telephone.
In the past three years, Islamist groups that had long been destabilising the thinly populated desert north of Mali have swept south into its wetter, more populated central regions, exploiting local conflicts to spread jihad.
That has shifted the battlefield closer to the more prosperous south and capital Bamako, raising concerns for the security of a presidential election expected between July and November.
""I can confirm that a transport vehicle left Dibo in Burkina and ran over a mine near the town of Boni in Mali,"" Kone said. ""The death toll is 13 and there are some wounded.""
Mali and its western neighbour Senegal plan to deploy 1,000 troops soon in an operation to pacify central Mali and contain jihadists who had previously been confined to its Saharan expanses in the north.
But analysts doubt they will be able to do so purely via military means. The Islamists are deft at instrumentalizing the grievances of Fulani cattle herders, and their disputes with local farmers over access to grazing lands. 
Periodic crackdowns on suspected jihadists have therefore tended to target the Fulani, further raising tensions and driving some of them into the militants' arms.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A general election in Thailand scheduled to take place this year will be delayed possibly until early 2019, the country's deputy prime minister said, after military-appointed lawmakers voted to change an election law on Thursday. 
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has said a general election would take place in November 2018. The date has been postponed several times since the military took power in a 2014 coup.
The National Legislative Assembly, Thailand's parliamentary body, voted to postpone enforcement of an election bill by three months to give political parties time to prepare for the vote.
The bill is one of four needed to hold a general election, which the constitution mandates be held within 150 days after all necessary electoral laws take effect. Delayed enforcement of one of these laws would push back the election. 
""Within 150 days after the law's enforcement in September means the election will fall on January or February 2019,"" Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam told reporters on Thursday, providing there are no further setbacks.
Wissanu said the government would only be able to determine when the election can take place once the bill is adopted in June.
Political parties said Thursday's vote was a ploy by the ruling junta to hold on to power.
The junta has not yet lifted a ban on political campaigning, although last month it issued an order that allows parties to conduct some preparation ahead of the poll. 
The Puea Thai Party, whose government the army ousted in 2014, said that the amendment was a tactic by the junta to tighten its grip on power.
""It is a dishonest act by those in power to seek political advantage in power in order to hold on to power and remain in power,"" the party said in a statement. 
Ong-art Klampaiboon, deputy leader of Puea Thai's rival Democrat Party, said a delay would hurt confidence in the government and could harm foreign investment. 
Delaying the election would give the junta more time to work on how to stay in power beyond 2018, said Peter Mumford, Asia Director at risk consultancy firm Eurasia Group. 
""I think they are still not confident that the election will deliver the result they want,"" Mumford told Reuters. 
Thailand's foreign minister Don Pramudwinai said this week the international community would understand if the vote is delayed. 

A U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Bangkok said the United States would like Thailand to return to democracy ""as soon as possible.""

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - The United States is in talks with the European Union about tightening sanctions on Iran over its missile program and foreign policy, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan told a conference in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.
Speaking in the capital Abu Dhabi, Ryan said the Islamic Republic was seeking to expand its influence in the region at the expense of staunch U.S. allies like the UAE and Saudi Arabia and needed to be constrained by sanctions.
The United States and other major powers lifted broad sanctions on Iran after a landmark deal over its nuclear program in 2015, but Washington has since slapped Tehran with new sanctions over its long-range missile program.
Ryan said the European Union should follow suit, underscoring a 120-day ultimatum President Donald Trump gave the U.S. Congress as well as the European allies, Britain, France, Germany to come up with a tougher approach toward Iran or else see the President reimpose full sanctions.
""Look at their violations of missile testing, look at what they're doing in the region, look at what they're doing in Syria, look at what they're doing in Yemen,"" Ryan said.
""There's more that we can do from the economic side. We have the tools we can use along with our allies ... that's the discussion we're having about tightening up sanctions and trying to get Europe involved in that,"" he added.
Trump has warned that the U.S. will not continue to abide by the nuclear accord, which he has called ""the worst deal ever negotiated"", and Britain, France and Germany have begun talks on a plan to satisfy him by addressing Iran's missile tests and its regional actions.
Iran has one of the Middle East’s largest missile programs and some of its precision-guided missiles have the range to strike Israel. Tehran has repeatedly said its missile program is defensive and not negotiable.
Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Arab countries accuse Iran of stoking wars and political crises around the region by supporting its Shi'ite co-religionists.
Tehran denies the charges and accuses Gulf Arab states of being pawns of Western powers seeking to dominate the region and advance the interests of its foe Israel.

""I invite them to visit Argentina and see what happens with an incredible country that adopted protectionism and isolation as a way of life,"" Macri said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday.
""It didn't work. We only deepened our poverty problems.""
The rising threat of global trade wars is a major theme of talks at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss town of Davos. Policymakers and economists are bristling over U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist agenda.
Trump is due to speak to the forum on Friday.
When Macri was elected in 2015, he took over a country that was on a path to financial ruin after a decade of free-spending populist policies.
After the country's 2001 default, Argentina was frozen out of global capital markets for years. Former President Cristina Fernandez implemented currency controls, erected import barriers to protect domestic industry, and printed money to cover a widening fiscal deficit during her two terms from 2007-2015.
The measures boosted certain sectors of the economy and financed an expansion of social programs for the poor, but generated a decline in central bank reserves and one of the world's highest inflation rates.
Macri has unwound currency controls, slashed taxes on key grains exports, reduced import restrictions and overhauled the tax and pension systems.
The measures have contributed to a dramatic decline in yields on Argentina's debt and a surging stock market. But Macri has struggled to slow double-digit inflation and convince companies the country is safe for long-term investment.
Macri said his administration aimed to reach single-digit inflation by the end of 2019. He said his country was keen on multilateral and bilateral trade agreements as it sought to restore confidence in its future. 
""We have been so isolated that we have only room to improve and to create better and long-term relationships,"" said Macri.
""We want to be part of global solutions, not global problems.""

ONITSHA, Nigeria (Reuters) - More than 43,000 Cameroonians have fled as refugees to Nigeria to escape a crackdown by the government on Anglophone separatists, local aid officials said on Thursday.
The figure is almost three times as high as that given by the United Nations and Nigerian officials two weeks ago.
Cameroon is a majority French-speaking country but two southwestern regions bordering Nigeria are Anglophone. Last October, separatists declared independence for a state they want to create called Ambazonia, sparking a military crackdown by the government of President Paul Biya.
In Nigeria's Cross River state, which borders southwest Cameroon, more than 33,000 Cameroonians have taken refuge from violence, John Inaku, director general of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), told Reuters by phone.
In neighboring Benue state, there are 10,216 refugees, said Emmanuel Shior, director general of the regional SEMA.
Earlier this month, the UN refugee agency had said more than 8,000 refugees were in Cross River state.
Explaining the disparity, Inaku told Reuters the UN agency was only registering people in Cross River coming in through conventional routes.
""This is a war situation and refugees are trooping in by the minute through the bush paths, rivers and every other unconventional routes open to them,"" he said. 
""During our advocacy to our border communities we told them to allow the refugees in and not be hostile to them so our communities have been receiving them warmly and accommodating them. These are very remote areas, hard to reach without good roads,"" Inaku said.
Inaku said community facilities were becoming overstretched and so people were getting hostile toward the refugees, who were in ""deplorable condition"", hungry and in need of medicine.
The Benue SEMA director general said the agency had also had difficulty counting refugees because they were in remote areas.
Early on Thursday, gunmen crossed from Nigeria to attack a border post in Cameroon's southwest, security force witnesses said, with the incident likely to further damage relations between the neighbors.
The separatists pose the biggest challenge yet to the 35-year rule of Biya, who will seek re-election this year. The conflict is also fuelling tensions between Nigeria and Cameroon.

Cameroonian military officials and pro-government media accuse Nigeria of sheltering the insurgents, who since last year have waged a guerrilla campaign to establish an independent homeland for Cameroon's English-speaking minority.

""My position is the same as expressed by the Lima Group,"" Santos told journalists on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, referring to a regional group that said this week the vote would lack legitimacy.

The Lima Group, whose members include Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Peru, Mexico and Colombia, has backed a peaceful solution to Venezuela's crisis, negotiated between Maduro's ruling party and the opposition.

Opposition groups in Venezuela have accused Maduro of steering the country into a crippling economic crisis, turning Venezuela into a dictatorship and skewing the election system to perpetuate power. Government officials respond they are fighting a U.S.-led right-wing conspiracy bent on ending socialism in Latin America, hobbling Venezuela's economy and stealing its oil wealth.

When the Sochi congress was first mooted last year, Kurdish officials said they had been invited, and would attend.
But Badran Jia Kurd, adviser to the Kurdish-led autonomous administration that runs parts of northern Syria, said it had not received a formal invitation to the Syria congress since it was confirmed to be taking place on Jan. 29-30 in Sochi.
""Regarding our position on an invitation - if it happens - we will not attend the congress in the light of this barbaric, occupation aggression on Afrin,"" Jia Kurd said. ""How can there be discussion of the solution at a time when stable, secure areas are pushed towards anarchy and battles?"" he said.
Syria's main Kurdish groups, which control large areas in the north, have consistently been left out of Syrian peacemaking efforts in line with the wishes of Turkey, which sees their ascendancy in border regions as a national security threat.
The Turkish military, supported by allied Syrian militia fighters, launched a major offensive against the Afrin region of northwestern Syria on Saturday, saying it aimed to crush the Kurdish YPG fighters who control that part of Syria.
Jia Kurd said Russia had been planning to invite to Sochi Arab and Kurdish representatives of the autonomous administration.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State had carried out the air strikes.
Rival military campaigns by the Syrian army with its allies, and by militias backed by a U.S.-led international coalition, last year seized most of Islamic State's territory in central and eastern Syria. 
The jihadist militant group still holds patches of desert on either side of the Euphrates River in Deir al-Zor province, as well as isolated pockets of ground elsewhere in Syria.
The attack targeted Shafah, a village east of the Euphrates, and at least seven women were among 13 dead, the Observatory said. Syrian state media citing local sources as saying coalition air strikes had killed 15 civilians in the village, including seven women.
Asked to comment, the coalition did not specifically say whether it had carried out the strike or not. It referred in an email to an earlier statement saying that coalition strikes had killed an estimated 145-150 Islamic State fighters in a command center near Shafah last Saturday.

749,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",EU ministers clash again over reforming asylum system,"SOFIA (Reuters) - European Union interior ministers grappled on Thursday with the politically charged issue of reforming the bloc's broken asylum system, which the bloc wants to fix by June.
For more than two years ex-communist states led by Poland and Hungary have defied pressure from other EU capitals to accept refugees at times of high immigration across the Mediterranean to help ease the burden on frontline states such as Greece and wealthy destination nations such as Germany. 
Poland, Hungary and others are reluctant to take in more refugees, who are mostly from Muslim nations in the Middle East and northern Africa, under a quota system. Germany and others say it is a question of EU solidarity.
""We cannot leave it all to the countries at the external borders (of the EU),"" Luxembourg's Jean Asselborn said ahead of talks with other interior ministers in Sofia, capital of Bulgaria, which holds the EU's rotating six-month presidency.
""We need relocation in times of crisis... so every country knows which burdens it will take on,"" he said of plans to oblige each EU state to host a certain number of people when arrivals jump. ""If we do not manage this, we will choke on it.""
The EU asylum system collapsed in 2015 as a million refugees and migrants arrived across the sea, overwhelming Greece and Italy. Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic refused to take some of the people in.
The dispute ended up in the courts and weakened the bloc's unity, spilling over to many other policy areas.
""The quota is not a good thing. But we still have other solutions,"" said Slovak Interior Minister Robert Kalinak, referring to a proposal by the eastern states to contribute money, experts and equipment instead of accepting people.
The EU has given itself until June to find a compromise acceptable to all, though there are no signs yet of progress.
The bloc could then defeat the reluctant easterners in a majority vote, but this would cause even more bad blood between EU states. 
The EU's migration chief, Dimitris Avramopoulos, said the ""stalemate"" had much to do with populist politicians stoking up immigration fears among voters.
""It's a question of how you think politically addressing... your domestic audience,"" he said on entering the talks.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's government has taken a first step towards preventing the election of ex-Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont as head of the Spanish region, the deputy prime minister said on Thursday as tensions rose again between Madrid and Barcelona. 
Puigdemont has been living in Brussels since he fled there in late October to avoid arrest on charges of sedition and rebellion for organising an illegal referendum and unilaterally declaring Catalan independence from Spain. 
Catalonia's newly elected parliament speaker, Roger Torrent, nominated Puigdemont on Monday as the sole candidate to be the regional president again, defying Spanish government warnings against such a move.
""Current circumstances do not permit his investiture,"" Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria told a news conference in Madrid, referring to the fact that there is an arrest warrant against Puigdemont in Spain. 
She said the government had asked the council of state to give its opinion on the possibility of appealing against the Catalan parliament speaker's nomination of Puigdemont to the constitutional court.
If the council's opinion echoes that of the Madrid government, the appeal will be filed immediately, she said.
""The parliament speaker has put forward as candidate someone who does not enjoy his full rights, who has no right to freedom of movement,"" Saenz de Santamaria said. ""Mr Torrent must have known that Mr Puigdemont could not enter Spain without being detained.""
The Catalan parliament must hold its first round of voting a new regional leader no later than Jan. 31.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called a new Catalan regional election in December to try to defuse the crisis but his gamble backfired when separatist parties won a majority, giving new impetus to the independence movement.

755,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>",Hungarian mass honoring Nazi ally canceled after Jewish protests,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - A Budapest church has called off a memorial mass it was planning to hold in honor of a former Hungarian leader and Nazi ally on Saturday - International Holocaust Remembrance Day - after protests from Hungarian Jews and the World Jewish Congress.
Parliament's deputy speaker who is member of the ruling Fidesz party of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, had been due to speak at the event called in memory of interwar Governor Miklos Horthy.
The planned ceremony for Horthy, an admiral who led Hungary for 24 years until 1944 and handed over hundreds of thousands of Jews to the Nazis, triggered strong objections from Jewish organizations.
With the WJC declaring it a provocative measure honoring an ""unabashed anti-semite"", the Budapest church which had organized the Catholic ceremony, canceled the event on Thursday. 
The affair, ahead of a parliamentary election on April 8, has thrown a spotlight again on the policies of Orban who has an ambivalent track record on anti-Semitism.
He has repeatedly pledged zero tolerance for anti-Semitism, though he has called Horthy an ""exceptional statesman."" He has risked angering Israel and Jewish people with remarks about ""ethnic homogeneity"" apparently aimed at radical right-wing voters ahead of the April 8 election.
He has also used a massive billboard campaign against U.S. billionaire George Soros, a Hungarian-born Jew, to promote an anti-immigrant agenda that critics, including Soros, say harks back to the 1930s. The government strongly rejects this.
Zoltan Osztie, the priest of the Budapest church, said the church had a tradition of organizing a mass for Horthy each year and nobody had noticed that Saturday was also International Holocaust Remembrance marking the day in 1945 when the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp was liberated.
""We could be blamed for this perhaps, but these two events can not be juxtaposed. Nonetheless, after discussion with church leaders a decision has been made that neither the memorial ceremony nor the mass will take place,"" he told szemlelek.blog.hu.
WJC President Ronald S. Lauder asked Orban to intervene, calling the event ""nothing short of a provocative measure.""
""The terror that Admiral Horthy, an unabashed anti-Semite, inflicted on the Jewish community of Hungary ... and his role in the deportation and murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews, must never be forgotten and can never be excused,"" Lauder wrote in a letter to Orban.
The government did not reply to Reuters questions.
Sandor Lezsak, deputy parliament speaker and a member of Fidesz party, had been due to speak at the ceremony, stirring protests from the Hungarian Jewish communities federation.
After Hungary's occupation by Germany in March 1944, still under Horthy's rule, Hungarian gendarmes and state organizations collaborated in the deportation of close to half a million Jews. Horthy stopped the deportations only in July 1944.

756,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>",Bulgaria delays vote on treaty that opposes violence against women,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria's ruling party on Thursday delayed a vote to ratify a European treaty designed to combat violence against women in the face of opposition from religious and political groups who said it could promote moral decay.
The delay gives time for debate on the Istanbul Convention but allows for ratification while Bulgaria holds the six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union, said Tsvetan Tsvetanov, parliamentary leader of the GERB party.
Opposition to the treaty spiked in recent days when the Bulgarian Orthodox Church said it would lead to moral decay.
Critics say it could encourage young people to identify as transgender or third sex and lead to marriage equality in the country of 7.1 million people.
Bulgaria is Europe's poorest nation and the dispute undermines the government's effort to present the nation as progressive, particularly while it holds the rotating EU presidency for the first time since joining the union in 2007.
At the same time, opposition to the treaty fits a broader rise of conservative politics in eastern Europe that have frequently set the region against Brussels.
The Mufti Office of the Muslim Denomination also opposed ratification and said: ""gender topics are dangerous, bottomless traps"" that endanger Bulgarian society.
GERB's junior coalition partner, the far-right United Patriots, opposed ratification and the opposition Socialists demanded a referendum on the issue. 
GERB says the treaty would not oblige Bulgaria to introduce a ""third sex"" legal category or to legalize gay marriage.
""There must be transparency and awareness during the vote,"" Tsvetanov told reporters. ""We are obliged to do what other EU countries, and even non-EU countries, have already done.""
""We will do our best in these weeks to have a further debate with the academic community, NGOs and experts so we can really explain everything that is related to the objectives of the convention and the opportunities it gives,"" he said. 
The government signed the 81-article document in 2016 and parliamentary ratification is the next step. In all, more than 40 countries have signed.
Bulgaria should ratify the treaty quickly, said Nils Muiznieks, Human Rights Commissioner at the Council of Europe said on Monday. The view was echoed by the deputy head of the EU Commission Frans Timmermans.

The solicitor general asked the court to direct the ombudsman to file 44 counts of ""reckless imprudence resulting in multiple homicide"" against the former president over the botched raid. 
A mission to arrest two al Qaeda-linked militants on the southern island of Mindanao went disastrously wrong when police Special Action Force commandos were ambushed and outnumbered by rebel gunmen in what was the biggest crisis of Aquino's 2010-2016 presidency.
Given that Aquino had full knowledge and approved the January 2015 raid in Mamasapano, Maguindanao province, he ""acted with inexcusable negligence, which was the direct proximate cause in the massacre of SAF 44,"" the office of the Solicitor General said. 
In November, the ombudsman filed charges against Aquino, but for a lesser crimes of usurpation of authority and corruption.
President Rodrigo Duterte has described those charges as ""silly"", while Aquino's spokeswoman, Abigal Valte, has said the full facts surrounding the deaths have yet to be presented. 
The Mamasapano killings also dealt a blow to Aquino's vaunted peace efforts with separatists of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which had agreed to disarm in return for self-rule over predominantly Muslim parts of Mindanao.
Duterte has urged Congress to pass a bill granting self-rule to the country's Muslim minority, warning that its collapse would see separatist rebels abandon a peace process and declare war again.

Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque, said the government was committed to providing justice to the police commandos who died to prevent a ""repeat of the waste of lives or promising future of gallant Filipinos"".

DOUALA (Reuters) - Gunmen attacked a border crossing in Cameroon's southwest on Thursday, launching their assault from Nigeria, security source witnesses said. 
No one was killed, the officials said, but the incident is likely to further damage relations between the neighbors, strained over the rise of an Anglophone Cameroonian separatist movement.
Five security and administrative agents said the unidentified gunmen launched their attack on the Ekok border post along Cross River.
""They came around 3 a.m. (0200 GMT). They came from Nigeria and there were many of them. They had heavy weapons. They had grenades. They were shooting everywhere,"" said one police source, who like the other witnesses asked not to be named.
He said the shooting lasted nearly three hours and the border remained closed on Thursday morning. 
""We don't really know how it happened,"" a second security source told Reuters. ""Some of these guys came from the riverside (beneath the bridge). We don't know exactly which path they took, but all of them came from Nigeria."" 
Government officials in Cameroon would not immediately comment on the attack. 
Nigeria's defense ministry spokesman said he was not aware of the incident and referred queries to the military. A Nigerian military spokesman said he was not aware of the attack but would make checks.
Cameroonian military officials and pro-government media accuse Nigeria of sheltering the insurgents, who since last year have waged a guerrilla campaign to establish an independent homeland for Cameroon's English-speaking minority.
Reuters reported last month that Cameroonian troops crossed into Nigeria in pursuit of the rebels without seeking authorization from Nigeria, provoking a behind-the-scenes rift between two nations with a history of fraught relations. 
(Cameroon refugee crisis graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2Djfjx5)
The militaries of Cameroon and Nigeria repeatedly clashed over the disputed Bakassi peninsula in the 1980s and 90s. 
The status of the territory was settled in Cameroon's favor by The Hague-based International Court of Justice in 2002 and in recent years the two countries have cooperated extensively to stamp out the Islamist militant group Boko Haram. 
More than 15,000 refugees have fled to Nigeria amid Cameroonian military operations against the Anglophone separatists, the United Nations refugee agency and Nigerian government officials said earlier this month.

Homosexuality is not regulated by law in Indonesia, except in Aceh province where Islamic law bans same-sex relations. But the world's largest Muslim-majority nation has seen a rise in hostility toward the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community, with activists saying their rights are not being adequately protected by the state. 
""The survey finds that, generally, the Indonesian public views the LGBT (community) negatively,"" the Saiful Mujani Research Centre said on its website. 
""But the public is also of the view that the LGBT community has the right to live in Indonesia and that the government should protect them like other citizens.""
There are sizeable minorities of Christians, Hindus, and those who adhere to native beliefs among Indonesia's 250 million people.
Indonesian police have over the last few years stepped up raids targeting ""spas"" or what they call ""gay sex parties"" and charged many of those involved with violating strict pornography laws. 
This has raised alarm bells among rights activists who say the law is being used to unfairly target LGBT individuals. More than 300 people were arrested in 2017 for alleged LGBT-behaviour, according to Human Rights Watch. 
""The police should stop criminalizing LGBT individuals and... instead protect them principally in their private spaces from harassment and intimidation,"" said Andreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch.
The Constitutional Court last month struck down a petition by a conservative group to ban all consensual extramarital sex including same-sex relations. But the group intends to lobby parliament as politicians deliberate revisions to the criminal code.
The pollster surveyed a total of 1,220 people of various religious backgrounds across Indonesia between March 2016 and December 2017 and found that 87 percent of them considered the LGBT community a ""threat to private or public life"". 
A similar proportion of people in the survey disagreed that an LGBT individual should be able to hold a leading public office, and said that they believed their religion prohibited LGBT activity.
The survey also found that around half the respondents did not know the meaning of the term ""LGBT"", which was used in all survey questions. The results were based on those who did.

Half of those who were aware of the term said the government should protect the LGBT community. A Pew Research Center survey found in 2013 that around 93 percent of Indonesians believed society should not accept homosexuality.

Earlier this month Qatar accused UAE military planes of repeatedly violating its airspace, while Bahrain and the UAE said Qatari warplanes had harassed two civilian Emirati airliners.
The two sides denied each other's accusations but have signaled they want to de-escalate the row, which comes at a time when relations between Qatar and its Gulf neighbors are very strained.
""Qatar will never provoke any country,"" Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Davos, in which he also said the rift between Doha and its Gulf neighbors was hampering regional security cooperation.
He said Qatar welcomed comments by a senior UAE military official this week that the military had received orders not to worsen the seven-month dispute with Doha.
""As far as we know, there is no intention about this military conflict. We have seen their announcement yesterday which we have welcomed. For us we don't see any solution other than resorting to dialogue,"" Sheikh Mohammed added.
Last June the UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, cut off travel and trade ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism and their arch-rival Iran.
Doha denies the charges and says the countries aim to curtail its sovereignty.

LASHAR GAH, Afghanistan (Reuters) - The governor of the western Afghan province of Farah resigned on Thursday after months of mounting insecurity that have fueled protests by residents fearful that the Taliban could threaten the provincial capital. 
Mohammad Aref Shah Jahan blamed political interference and corruption among security forces in the province, on the frontier with Iran in the far west of the country.
""I have resigned from my post because of the worsening security situation in Farah,"" he told reporters, adding that there had been ""interference in my responsibilities from various individuals"".
Although Afghan and U.S. military commanders have expressed growing optimism about battlefield successes against the Taliban, backed by increased American air strikes, the problems in Farah show how unstable security remains in many areas.
Farah, one of the poorest provinces in Afghanistan, has seen months of fighting and accusations of collusion between some units in the police and the Taliban, fueled by cross-border smuggling and drug trafficking.
Jahan's resignation underscored how President Ashraf Ghani's government, currently engaged in an unrelated standoff with the powerful governor of Balkh province in the north, has struggled to maintain control in many areas outside the capital Kabul.
On Wednesday, hundreds of people took to the streets of Farah city, the provincial capital, setting fire to two police vehicles and protesting about the lack of security and demanding the provincial leadership resign.
""Farah has been suffering from a lot of internal issues for a long time,"" said Farid Bakhtawar, head of the provincial council. ""Security forces are there but involved in corruption and selling their outposts, weapons and fuel to the Taliban.""
Local officials have also blamed neighboring Iran, which the United States says is trying to extend its influence in western Afghanistan, for providing the insurgents with money and modern weapons and explosives.
Security forces have been rushed in to bolster the defenses after Farah city came close to being overrun by the Taliban last week but commanders say the immediate threat has eased.
""There is an ongoing operation in Farah and we understand there are problems we need to fix,"" said Mohammad Naser Hedayat, commander of 207th Zafar Army Corps based in the neighboring province of Herat.
""We recently deployed three battalion-size units to Farah from the police and army to start to push the Taliban back and the operation is going successfully,"" he said.
However many in the city fear it could still fall.
""The shops in the city were closed for days and there is still panic among the people that the Taliban are returning,"" said Haji Hashem, a car dealer in the city. He said gunfire and explosions, although no longer so close, could still be heard outside the city.
""The government here has lost its way and has no clue how to deal with the situation,"" he said.

JUBA (Reuters) - An internationally backed ceasefire monitoring team in South Sudan said it has asked the U.N. Security Council to say whether leaders violating a peace treaty should face asset freezes, regional travel bans, or an arms embargo.
The statement comes a day after Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, urged the body to impose an arms embargo and spoke of growing international frustration with the South Sudanese government. 
South Sudan has been riven by civil war since 2013 after clashes between troops loyal to former vice president Riek Machar and President Salva Kiir. The fighting took on ethnic overtones, killing tens of thousands of people, causing widespread hunger and forced a third of the population to flee. 
The ceasefire monitoring commission, chaired by former Botswana president Festus Mogae, is supposed to oversee a largely ignored 2015 peace deal. Both sides have repeatedly violated it. A ceasefire negotiated in December was violated within hours, the monitors have said. 
“We cannot stand by as South Sudanese leaders sign an agreement one day and authorize or allow its violation with impunity the next,"" Mogae said in the statement on Thursday after addressing the U.N. Security Council via videolink from Juba. 
South Sudan’s government spokesman Michael Makuei Lueth told Reuters on Thursday that the ceasefire monitors were unfair and relied on second-hand information. 
“This is very unfortunate and it is a misleading report and the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) should not have listened to such report,"" he said. ""They are working hard to weaken the government so that the rebels become stronger and they take over.""
Rebel deputy spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel said they would welcome any intervention by the international community to enforce the tattered ceasefire. 
“We welcome his idea to make sure those who violated the ceasefire are held responsible,"" he said. ""We need proper investigations to find out who is responsible for the violation of the ceasefire this time.""
Haley had warned bluntly that the administration was running out of patience with South Sudan's leaders.
""Things are going backwards in South Sudan,"" she said, noting that despite promises from Kiir, aid workers still faced huge fees and restrictions and that the government had promoted three generals sanctioned for severe human rights abuses. 
""The time has come to acknowledge the hard reality that the leaders of South Sudan are not just failing their people, they are betraying them,"" she said. ""It’s long past time that the Security Council establish an arms embargo on South Sudan.""

A small flotilla of fishing vessels set out at dawn from Boulogne and others were expected to join from Dunkirk, said fisherman Stephane Pinto. 
""The Port of Calais is closed due to French fisherman blockade. Currently no ship movements in the port,"" P&O Ferries Freight said on Twitter.
A Calais port spokeswoman said negotiations were underway and that port authorities expected the blockade would be lifted by midday. 
Some two million lorries, tens of thousands of coaches and 10 million passengers pass through Calais every year, Jean-Marc Puissesseau, the port's general manager, told Reuters earlier this month as he detailed the risks to trade flows from Brexit. [nL8N1P90LW] 
Pinto said the protest was over losses caused by some countries' practice of electric pulse fishing. French fishermen say pulse fishing in demarcated zones is depleting fish numbers. The technique uses electrodes to emit electric waves, stunning fish which then float upwards and are scooped up by giant nets.
""We're at our wits ends. We feel abandoned,"" said Pinto, who together with his colleagues already frets that Britain's exit from the European Union will end their access to British waters.
The European Parliament on Jan. 16 voted in favour of banning commercial pulse fishing. Opponents say it is tantamount to putting a taser gun in the water. 
Supporters, including The Netherlands which has issued permits to about 80 of its trawlers, say the technique reduces unwanted bycatch and avoids ploughing nets along the seabed.

The European Parliament vote was advisory but means the issue will now be debated with the European Commission and members states and could lead to legislation.

LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - A huge plume of ash billowed from the glowing peak of the Philippines' most active volcano on Thursday, as more residents of surrounding areas fled and experts warned of further escalation 12 days after it started to erupt.
A cloud hovered some 8,202 feet (2,500 meters) above Mount Mayon in central Albay province and orange lava fountained and flowed down from its crater as magma continued to move beneath.
Scientists recorded regular episodes of intense activity throughout the day. Tourists, residents and media gathered at vantage points to document the drama at the country's most impressive volcano, which last erupted in 2014.
Mayon's unrest has displaced about 75,500 people, the majority of whom are in evacuation centers, where children lined up for meals and parents braced for the possibility of a long stay away from home.
""We are worried. We got used to the volcano, but we are still afraid,"" said one evacuee, Irene Agao.
""If only we could, we would go home right now, away from this evacuation center, but we need to stay. Because we never know what else the beautiful Mayon volcano will do.""
Government offices and schools have been closed in 17 towns and municipalities and 66 flights have been canceled in recent days. The authorities have warned residents far from the area to stay indoors to avoid heavy ash fall.
The alert remains just one notch below the highest level of 5, after five more episodes. The provincial government has expanded the no-go area around the 2,462-metre (8,077-foot) Mayon to a radius of 9 kilometers.
Mayon was showing no signs of calming down soon, said Paul Alanis of the Philippine volcanology agency. 
""Right now our instruments around the volcano are measuring or detecting magma constantly coming up from below,"" Alanis said.

""So there's always that danger, that this may still escalate.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Senior members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc stressed on Thursday they would not give ground to the Social Democrats (SPD) on immigration as the two parties prepare to launch make-or-break negotiations on forming a government.
The SPD voted by a whisker on Sunday to start coalition talks with the conservatives but many members are skeptical about a re-run of the ""grand coalition"" that has ruled Germany since 2013. The SPD got its worst election result in the postwar era in September and many fear a further fall in votes.
Immigration will be one of the most controversial issues in the talks, with the conservatives keen to take a tough line to prevent further losses to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) while the SPD takes a more migrant-friendly approach.
Julia Kloeckner, deputy of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), said the benchmark of 180,000 to 220,000 refugees per year laid out in a coalition blueprint agreed between the parties after exploratory talks earlier this month was crucial.
""We don't want more immigration and certainly not uncontrolled immigration - the Jusos must accept that,"" Kloeckner told Focus magazine, referring to the youth wing of the SPD that has railed against another grand coalition and criticised the benchmark as being equivalent to a migrant cap.
Dorothee Baer, deputy chair of Merkel's Bavarian CSU allies, said her party could not give the SPD any concessions on family reunification for refugees, with all possible wiggle room for this exploited during exploratory talks.
She told broadcaster ARD the parties had already negotiated that issue, adding: ""We won't reopen issues that have already been negotiated.""
The coalition blueprint said the parties would cap at 1,000 a month the number of people who will be allowed to join their family now living as refugees in Germany. But the SPD wants to add a ""hardship provision"" to that.
The SPD is meeting on Thursday to prepare for the coalition negotiations that are due to begin on Friday after four months of political deadlock since September's election.
On her way into that meeting, senior SPD member Manuela Schwesig said: ""We want to have good, detailed negotiations now. They need to be swift but we also need to take the time we need so something good comes out of it.""
But the SPD is facing strong internal opposition and new members are joining the party in hordes in the hope they can reject a renewed coalition with the conservatives because the SPD has vowed to let its 443,000 members vote on a final deal.
Kevin Kuehnert, head of the Jusos who is spearheading attempts to prevent a grand coalition, told broadcaster n-tv: ""We've had some extremely bad experiences working with the conservatives.""

He added that some of the projects laid out in the coalition blueprint had already been agreed on by the parties in 2013 but not carried out during the last legislative period.

768,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Irish PM says no sign of Britain backtracking on border deal,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - There has been no sign that Britain intends to backtrack on the commitments it made in December on the Irish border and doing so would erode trust for the rest of the Brexit negotiations, Ireland's Prime Minister said on Thursday.
A breakthrough on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will be the UK's only land frontier with the EU after its departure, allowed negotiators to strike a deal in December that paved the way for talks on future trade ties. 
In it Britain pledged that if it cannot strike the kind of free trade deal it wishes, Northern Ireland would remain aligned with the rules of the EU's single market and customs union, both of which London is officially committed to leaving.
Some EU officials say it remains unclear how Britain can fully meet the three key pledges it made in those circumstances: keeping Northern Irish rules in line with the EU, keeping Northern Ireland aligned with the UK mainland and allowing the UK to diverge from EU regulations.
""I haven't seen any evidence of that yet,"" Leo Varadkar, attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, told Reuters when asked if he was at all wary that Britain might backtrack on some of its commitments.
""I don't think the United Kingdom will depart from that and if they try to, it would send a very bad message in general as well, that if you agree something in December and try to move away from it in February, it's very hard to trust that person, so I'm sure they wouldn't do that,"" he said.
Varadkar acknowledged that it will be difficult to give effect to the border agreement but that the easiest way to do so would be for Britain and the EU to have a future relationship not very far from the current arrangement.
Comments by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Davos that Britain could have as close a relationship as it wanted were both very reassuring and very significant, Varadkar said.
Such an outcome would also mean Ireland would not have to ask the EU for specific assistance in dealing with the economic fallout from Brexit, he added. Varadkar and his predecessor Enda Kenny had said previously a request for aid was likely.
After U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's welcoming of a weaker dollar on Wednesday took center stage on world markets, Varadkar said concerns around the Swiss Alps resort of a currency war had been excessively heightened and was unlikely to transpire. 

""I would ask the question to anyone who is considering a trade war or a currency war - who's ever won one? All that happens when you go down that road in terms of policy is that everyone ends up worse off,"" he said.

Deputy Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Khaled al-Jarallah said he had conveyed ""regrets and admonishment"" to the Saudi ambassador to Kuwait over remarks directed at the minister of youth and sport, Khalid al-Rodhan, by the head of Saudi Arabia's sports committee, Turki Al al-Sheikh, who is also a Saudi royal court adviser.
""We assert our rejection and astonishment at this insult because of its impact on the warm and distinguished fraternal relations between the two sisterly countries,"" official news agency KUNA reported late on Wednesday, quoting Jarallah as telling journalists at an Indian embassy reception.
Jarallah spoke after Al al-Sheikh, in a message on his Twitter account, slammed Rodan following a visit he made to Qatar last week reportedly to thank Doha for its help in getting a FIFA ban on Kuwaiti soccer lifted.
""Rodan, simply is mercenaries in the shadow of positions... This mercenary will not harm Saudi Arabia's historic relations with its sister Kuwait, and he only represents himself in what he said,"" Al al-Sheikh said in his January 21 posting.
Kuwaiti and Qatari media had published a photo of Rodan standing next to Qatar's emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani holding a Kuwaiti soccer team T-shirt.
The crisis, in which Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have boycotted Qatar, arose in summer 2016 when the four countries cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Doha, accusing it of financing terrorism.
Riyadh also accuses Qatar of cosying up to the kingdom's arch-rival Iran. Qatar rejects the charges and says it is being penalized for straying from its neighbors’ backing for authoritarian rulers.
Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah has sought to maintain neutrality while he has tried to arbitrate an end to the rift, which has worsened to the point where both sides vilify each other regularly.
Kuwaiti courts, enforcing strict laws that prohibit citizens from insulting other countries or their leaders, have passed prison sentences on writers accused of misusing social media.
Earlier this week, a Kuwait court sentenced a newspaper columnist to a second five-year prison term in absentia for insulting Saudi Arabia. Abdullah Mohammed al-Saleh, who now lives in Britain, has said he had only exercised legitimate criticism of the kingdom.
Earlier this month, Kuwaiti media reported that writer Fouad al-Hashem was sentenced to seven years in jail for insulting Qatar.

CHIANG MAI, Thailand (Reuters) - A visit by a Thai princess to a women's prison on Thursday spotlighted the need for reform in a country that houses some of the world's most crowded jails, partly because of its battle against the scourge of illicit drugs.
Several Southeast Asian governments, led by the Philippines, have adopted hardline policies on drug-related crimes, putting a heavy burden on their jails, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) says.
Thailand has about a tenth of Southeast Asia's population, but about 40 per cent of its prisoners, most convicted of drug offences. 
""We have to ensure fair and equitable justice, understand the reasons people are ending up in prison, and we also have to address the specific needs of women,"" Thailand's Princess Bajrakitiyabha Mahidol said. 
The remarks came as she led diplomats on a visit to the Women's Correctional Institute in the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai, to show how it had applied rules embodying a more gender-sensitive approach.
The prison is one of ten in Thailand piloting the ""Bangkok Rules"", or guidelines for the treatment of female prisoners adopted by the United Nations' General Assembly in 2010.
""Women have very different needs,"" Jeremy Douglas, UNODC Regional Representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, told Reuters. ""They have health needs, they have children. So if they follow a male prison model it doesn't work.""
Thailand has the fourth highest number of women prisoners in the world, after the United States, China, and Russia, says a French non-government body, the International Federation for Human Rights. 
Some of the prison's 1,982 women inmates, 80 percent of whom have drug convictions, said they had experienced a difference since it adopted the U.N. Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners, as they are formally known.
""When I first came here it had been a male prison. It was very dirty. It's cleaner now,"" a 43-year-old who is serving a life sentence for trafficking methamphetamine pills, told Reuters during a visit to the prison.
In the prison's nursery, mothers were being encouraged to breastfeed their babies and elsewhere, other inmates received training in silk weaving and traditional massage.
Yet much remains to be done.
Women's prisons in Thailand are ready to adopt the Bangkok Rules, said Bussaba Sakrangkul, director of the Chiang Mai prison, but some facilities needed to be upgraded and some design changes made. 
Overcrowding also remains an issue, with up to 50 inmates sleeping in a single room.

""What we've been looking out for is how to reduce prison overcrowding, not only in Thailand but across the region,"" Douglas said, adding that such steps called for changes to drug policy, shorter jail terms and treatment programmes.

771,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",EU court bars 'gay test' for asylum seekers,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Hungarian immigration officials should not have put a Nigerian asylum seeker through psychological tests to determine whether he was telling the truth that he was gay, the EU's top court ruled on Thursday.
Effectively barring use of sexual orientation testing as an invasion of ""the most intimate aspects"" of life, the Court of Justice found that the unidentified man from Nigeria should not have been pressured into examinations that included drawing a picture of a person in the rain and the Rorschach ink-blot test.
The unnamed man filed a request for refugee status in the Hungarian city of Szeged in April 2015. At the time Hungary was starting to face a surge in illegal migrants from Africa and the Middle East crossing the EU border from Serbia.
The man based his claim on the fact that, as a homosexual, he faced persecution in his home country.
The EU court ruled: ""The performance of such a test amounts to a disproportionate interference in the private life of the asylum seeker."" The Luxembourg-based judges noted that the EU executive has disputed the reliability of such tests.
In the Rorschach test a participant's perceptions of inkblots are recorded and are then analyzed for clues about his or her personality characteristics and emotional functioning. 
On the basis of the tests, the Hungarian state-appointed psychologist concluded that the Nigerian man was not homosexual and his claim was rejected, prompting an appeal.
In responding to the Hungarian court which referred the case, the ECJ said it was acceptable to seek expert opinion but this must be obtained in ways consistent with human rights and should not be the sole basis of a ruling.
Hungary's right-wing government has been in the forefront of efforts, particularly among ex-communist states in the east, to stiffen the European Union's frontiers against asylum seekers.
It was among the first countries hit by a wave of more than a million people who entered the EU via Greece in 2015 after taking to flimsy boats crossing the Mediterranean from Turkey.
That crisis shook the EU's cohesion, and efforts to reform a common asylum policy remain a source of deep discord.

772,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 06:22AM ET</span>","Special Report: With more Islamic schooling, Erdogan aims to reshape Turkey","By Daren Butler
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - On a hill overlooking Istanbul is a religious school where, 50 years ago, a boy from a working class district attended classes in Islam. The boy was Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's future president. The school was one of the first Imam Hatip schools, founded by the state to educate young men to be imams and preachers.
At the start of the 2017-2018 academic year in September, Erdogan returned to his old school, now renamed the Recep Tayyip Erdogan Anatolian Imam Hatip upper school after an $11 million redevelopment. He recalled the ""tough days"" of his childhood and the spirit in the school that drove its students to success.
""The joint goal of all education and our teaching system is to bring up good people with respect for their history, culture and values,"" Erdogan told flag-waving children at a ceremony to mark the reopening of the school.
Erdogan has said one of his goals is to forge a ""pious generation"" in predominantly Muslim Turkey ""that will work for the construction of a new civilization."" His recent speeches have emphasized Turkey's Ottoman history and domestic achievements over Western ideas and influences. Reviving Imam Hatip, or Imam and Preacher, schools is part of Erdogan's drive to put religion at the heart of national life after decades of secular dominance, and his old school is just one beneficiary of a government program to pump billions of dollars into religious education.
(Graphic of education spending: http://tmsnrt.rs/2DqHD0k)
A Reuters review of government budget and investment plans shows that spending on Imam Hatip upper schools for boys and girls aged 14 to 18 will double to 6.57 billion lira ($1.68 billion) in 2018 - nearly a quarter of the total upper schools budget. Although the 645,000 Imam Hatip students make up only 11 percent of the total upper school population, they receive 23 percent of funding - double the spend per pupil at mainstream schools.
Since 2012, when Imam Hatip education was extended to middle schools for pupils aged 10 to 14, total pupil numbers have risen fivefold to 1.3 million students in over 4,000 schools. The government intends to complete construction of 128 Imam Hatip upper schools in 2018 and has plans to build a further 50, the budget and investment plans show. Turkey has also increased religious education teaching at regular state schools, some of which have been converted into Imam Hatip schools. The government declined to say how many.
But for all the extra cash they receive, the Islamic schools are underperforming the regular ones, key metrics show.
The education ministry didn't respond to questions about the expansion of Imam Hatip schools. Education Minister Ismet Yilmaz has said previously that the government is responding to popular demand by opening new Imam Hatip schools. ""We are doing whatever our citizens say,"" he said at a ground-breaking ceremony for a school mosque in December.
(For a graphic of school locations: http://tmsnrt.rs/2DobSV3)
An official in the president's office referred Reuters to Erdogan's public remarks on Imam Hatip schools and declined to comment further. A government adviser said, ""Islam is not being forced on people. It is not a matter of saying everyone should go to Imam Hatips. We are just providing an opportunity to those families who want to send their children to Imam Hatips.""
The expansion of religious education is unsettling some Turks. Interviews with two dozen parents, teachers and education officials point to deep divisions over the role of Islam in education. Some secularist parents say the Islamist school movement is robbing their children of resources and opportunity. Those differences are part of a wider disagreement between liberal and secular sections of society and Erdogan's support base of conservative, pious Turks.
It was that support base that swept Erdogan's Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party, the AK Party, to power in 2002. Since then, critics have accused Erdogan of rolling back the secular state founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923 and weakening its pillars - the army, judiciary and media. Relations between NATO-member Turkey and its U.S. and European partners have become strained. Ankara's bid to join the European Union has stalled and Western countries have criticized Turkey over mass arrests that followed a failed military coup in July 2016.
PRAISE AND PROTEST
The new Recep Tayyip Erdogan Anatolian Imam Hatip school complex, its Islamic-style architecture rising in a historic district on the European side of Istanbul, is a source of pride for the parents of the 800 children who fill its classrooms and playground.
""God willing, all our schools will reach this standard and quality,"" said Kamber Cal, 45, a chemist. His 16-year-old son is delighted to attend the school, he said. ""My daughter is now dreaming about going to Imam Hatip, the time when she will cover up and she will learn about the Koran and the Prophet's life.""
In a mosque on the roof, boys listened to a preacher before Friday prayers when a Reuters reporter visited the school in October, while in the playground below, other boys played football. Some students perused books on shelves in the corridors. The school's website vaunts its success in pursuits including karate, biology, chemistry, Arabic, music and Koran recitation. Religious education lessons account for around a quarter to a third of the curriculum in Imam Hatip schools.
Cal and other advocates of Imam Hatip schools say parents want a strong moral education for their children. ""If there is demand, it must be met. How high will this go? To 20, 25, 40 percent"" of pupils? ""Demand and society will decide,"" Cal said.
Such a prospect is anathema to secularists, people on the political left and members of the minority Alevi faith, which draws upon Shi'ite, Sufi and Anatolian folk traditions and rituals that differ sharply from those of the country's Sunni majority. Feray Aytekin Aydogan, chairwoman of the Egitim-Sen teachers' trade union and a critic of the expansion of Imam Hatip schools, said: ""There is no need to give people religious education in order for them to get a profession.""
Erdogan's redeveloped school stands as a paragon among religious schools. On the Asian side of the city, the crowded 60th Year Sarigazi middle school, established six decades after the founding of Turkey's secular republic, illustrates some challenges that the spread of Imam Hatip schools has presented. Sarigazi is a non-religious school, in an area with a strong Alevi and secular community, but a large part of the premises has been converted into an Imam Hatip school.
A group of parents has petitioned education authorities to stop the conversion, collecting hundreds of signatures. Those parents say the change began several years ago with a few Imam Hatip ""guest"" classes but has since expanded to 1,300 pupils, encroaching on the building where some 3,000 students study in a regular middle school. The mother of a 10-year-old girl at the regular school said she and other parents would continue their fight against the school's conversion. She said it was wrong to force Islam on people. Like several other secularist parents interviewed, the woman declined to give her name.
Parents complained that non-religious students at the 60th Year Sarigazi middle school get less support than Imam Hatip students and that their classes are more crowded, with an average 40 pupils in a classroom, compared with 30 on the Imam Hatip side. They say they have lost laboratory and art space. The mother of a boy at the school said her son asked, ""Why is the Imam Hatip part of the school better?""
Reuters could not independently verify the parents' claims and the education ministry declined to comment. But in response to the parents' petition, education authorities said there were plans to build a new school in the area. It was unclear which students would move there.
Parents at the Sarigazi middle school claim success for another petition they filed in October to halt construction of a wall at one end of a playground. They saw the wall as an attempt to divide the school permanently. The local education authority said it had halted construction, without giving a reason.
A group of parents at another school - the Mahmut Kemal Inal middle school on the Asian side of Istanbul - failed in a campaign to prevent it being converted into an Imam Hatip. They picketed at the gates and organized protests and a petition signed by hundreds. It was to no avail. The only intake for the 2017-2018 academic year was of Imam Hatip students. ""I am sad that we were ignored,"" said Fulya Yilmaz, whose 11-year-old daughter attends the school.
Education authorities said the local community wanted the school to become an Imam Hatip school. But Yilmaz said only 125 students had enrolled in September, a low intake. On average around 230 pupils normally study in each of the school's four year groups. The education authority declined to comment on enrolment details.
""SCHOOLS FOR MORALITY""
Successive AK Party governments have given a high priority to education, ramping up the education ministry's spending to some 12.3 percent of the entire budget this year from 6.9 percent in 2003, the AK Party's first full year in power.
Despite all the money allocated to the schools, figures on 2017 university placements show graduates of religious schools lag their peers in regular schools. Only 18 percent of applicants from religious schools earned places on full degree courses at university last year, compared with 35 percent from regular state upper schools and 45 percent from private upper schools.
A survey of academic performance published in December 2016 for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development showed the success of Imam Hatip upper school students was below the national average.
More broadly, Turkey slipped an average of eight places in the survey's rankings for science, mathematics and reading, compared with the previous study three years earlier, to 50th among 72 countries. That marked a reversal of the progress Turkey made in the previous two terms of AK Party government. It was also a setback for Erdogan, who hopes that driving up education standards will help achieve his target of making Turkey one of the world's 10 largest economies by 2023, the centenary of the founding of Ataturk's secular republic. Turkey is currently a member of the Group of 20 top global economies.
Reuters could not determine whether socioeconomic factors were contributing to the performance gap between Imam Hatip and regular schools because there is no data available on pupils' family backgrounds, their income and education. However, religious schools are found in towns and cities across Turkey, in poor and affluent districts.
While the number of Imam Hatip schools has surged in recent years, the number of students in Imam Hatip upper schools dipped slightly last year. Opposition lawmaker Engin Altay said the slide was ""directly correlated with the low success rate of Imam Hatip upper schools in an academic sense."" Education Ministry Undersecretary Yusuf Tekin said Imam Hatip upper schools had filled 84 percent of their quota for 2017-2018. Standard curriculum upper schools had exceeded theirs.
Advocates of Imam Hatip schools say the current expansion should be seen in the context of the previous suppression of these schools. They point to a crackdown in 1997 when Turkey's then powerful military pressured the first Islamist-led government out of power and forced the closure of most Imam Hatip establishments.
Muslims went out into the squares to defend their rights in protests. Businessman Hanefi Gundogan, 49, said he was unable to send his eldest son to an Imam Hatip school because of the crackdown, but now his youngest attends such a school.
""Muslims have now reached a point where they can breathe more easily in their own country,"" he said. ""In the last 15 years this government has shown respect to Muslims.""
Halit Bekiroglu, chairman of an association of Imam Hatip members and graduates, said secularist fears about the schools were exaggerated. Their revival, he said, reflected the conservative religious character of most of Turkish society and a desire for a change in an education system that previously imported Western ideas.
""Modernization and Westernization were not implemented healthily. They were implemented in a superficial, formalistic, harsh, copy-paste way. This was not in harmony with this country's sociology,"" he told Reuters in the association's offices, overlooking the huge dome of the 6th century Hagia Sophia.
Parents who send their children to Imam Hatip schools speak of their desire for them to have a strong moral education. It's a theme Erdogan stressed during his visit to his old school. ""The school brought up children with such morality that they would not even pick fruit which hung from the apple tree hanging over the school walls,"" he said.
Whatever the origins of the Islamist education revival, critics are worried by it. Batuhan Aydagul, director of Education Reform Initiative, an independent think tank in Istanbul, said: ""What we see now is a 'national and native' identity being constructed in education.""
The most recent national curriculum, announced in July, excluded Charles Darwin's theory of evolution from science lessons. The government has also doubled religious teaching in regular schools to two hours per week. This compulsory teaching is a bone of contention for many secular Turks. Some have launched legal action to secure exemptions for their children.

One parent who did so successfully was mathematical engineer Ozlem Koc, 42, who lives on the Asian side of Istanbul. She won a court case in June after a year-long battle with education authorities to exempt her 10-year-old son from religious education, arguing that it was contrary to human rights to force it on children.
""This is not just my personal case,"" she said. ""I want my child to be exempt from religious lessons, but I am also fighting for compulsory religious education to be removed from the curriculum.""

773,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 06:19AM ET</span>",U.S. aircraft carrier to visit Vietnam in post-war first,"By Phil Stewart and James  Pearson  (LON:PSON)
HANOI (Reuters) - In a post-war first, the United States is poised to send an aircraft carrier to Vietnam in March, officials of both sides said on Thursday, dramatic evidence of deepening military ties between them, more than four decades after the Vietnam War.
The announcement came during a two-day visit to Hanoi by U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that had been expected to focus on shared concerns about China.
The proposed visit is set for March at the central port of Danang, Vietnam's defence ministry said in a statement. Such a visit by a U.S. aircraft carrier could bring the most U.S. forces to Vietnam since the conflict ended in 1975.
Mattis cheered the planned port visit during talks with Nguyen Phu Trong, the general secretary of the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam.
""Thank you for the increasing partnership, with our aircraft carrier coming into Danang here in March,"" Mattis said.
Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, confirmed the carrier visit was discussed by Mattis and Defence Minister Ngo Xuan Lich, and Vietnam's defence ministry was seeking final approvals from national leaders. 
""We expect it will be approved,"" Davis said.
The arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier in Vietnam will be welcomed by an emerging network of countries that are nervously eyeing China's military rise, particularly its assertive stance and island-building activities in the South China Sea.
The busy waterway is a vital global trade route linking Northeast Asia with the Middle East and Europe.
In particular, the militaries of U.S., Japan, India and Australia are working more closely together as a ""quad"" of liberal democracies across what they now term the ""Indo-Pacific"" – moves driven by mistrust of China.
U.S. Pacific Commander Admiral Harry Harris last week described China as a ""disruptive transitional force in the Indo-Pacific"" after meetings with Japanese and Indian military leaders in New Delhi.
India, Japan and Australia have all boosted military relations with Vietnam in recent years, with New Delhi providing advanced training for its emerging submarine forces and jet fighter pilots.  
BACKROOM DIPLOMACY 
Thursday's confirmation of the U.S. aircraft carrier visit to Danang caps months of backroom military diplomacy between Hanoi and the Pentagon, diplomats said.
The prospect surfaced when U.S. President Donald Trump met Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc at the White House last May, and talks continued when Vietnamese Defence Minister Ngo Xuan Lich met Mattis in Washington in August.
Vietnam's Deputy Defence Minister Nguyen Chi Vinh became the country's highest-ranking official to tour a U.S. carrier when he led 11 Vietnamese officials to watch flight operations aboard the USS Carl Vinson off southern California last October, the U.S. Navy said at the time.
Although no U.S. aircraft carrier has been to Vietnam since the end of the war, other, smaller U.S. warships have made high-level visits as ties improved in recent years. 
    That includes a 2016 visit by submarine tender USS Frank Cable and guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain to Cam Ranh Bay, which was a crucial logistics complex during the Vietnam War.
The planned carrier visit was ""highly significant"", said Ian Storey, a South China Sea expert at the ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. 
""It is a potent symbol of the way the defence relationship has moved forward against the backdrop of China's rising power,"" Storey added.
Decades after the U.S. war in Vietnam, ties between the United States and the Communist-ruled state are increasingly seen through shared concern over China's aggressive behaviour in the South China Sea, through which more than $3 trillion in cargo passes every year.
Vietnam has emerged as the most vocal opponent of China's territorial claims and has been buying U.S. military hardware, such as an armed, Hamilton-class Coast Guard cutter.     
The ship, one U.S. official said, was larger than anything Vietnam had in its navy. 
""(Vietnam) does have one of the region's fastest growing economies and so freedom of navigation and access in the South China Sea will be critical to them economically and of course in their security efforts,"" Mattis said before arrival on Wednesday.
U.S. ties with Vietnam have developed significantly in the decades since they normalised ties in 1995. Still, there were vivid reminders of the history of conflict during Mattis' visit.
That included a stop by Mattis on Tuesday to a U.S. Defense Department office in Hanoi that seeks to recover the remains of U.S. troops killed in the conflict. 

About 1,293 U.S. military personnel are still unaccounted for, a U.S. official said.

Russian news agency Ferghana News, which focuses on Central Asia, has reported that China will build the base in northern Afghanistan. The report was picked up last week by U.S. magazine The Diplomat and then in Chinese state media.
Speaking at a regular news briefing, ministry spokesman Wu Qian said that the two countries had normal security cooperation and that China like other countries was supporting Afghanistan in defense and counter-terrorism.
""The so-called issue that China is building a military base in Afghanistan is groundless,"" Wu said.
The ministry has also previously dismissed reports that Chinese military vehicles were patrolling inside Afghanistan.
China has long been concerned that instability in Afghanistan could spill over into the violence-prone Xinjiang region in China's far west, home to the Muslim Uighur people, where hundreds of people have died in recent years in unrest blamed by China on Islamist militants.
China has also worked with Pakistan and the United States to broker peace talks to end Afghanistan's Taliban insurgency that has raged since the militants were ousted by U.S.-backed forces in 2001.
China opened its first overseas military base, in the Horn of Africa country Djibouti, last year. China has previously denied having plans for other overseas bases, but the United States expects China to build more, with Pakistan a likely location.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said this week she does not exclude the possibility of China attacking them, amid heightened tensions between the two sides including an increasing number of Chinese military drills near Taiwan.
Beijing has taken an increasingly hostile stance towards Taiwan, which it considers a breakaway province, since the election two years ago of Tsai of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party.
China suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence, a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing, though she has said she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to ensuring peace. 
Asked about Tsai's attack remarks, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Wu Qian said China is willing to show the greatest amount of goodwill to seek ""peaceful reunification"".
""But we will certainly will not allow Taiwan to separate from the motherland,"" Wu told a regular monthly news briefing. 
In recent months, China has stepped up military drills around Taiwan, alarming Taipei. China says the exercises are routine.
The Chinese aircraft carrier the Liaoning has this month sailed twice through the Taiwan Strait, the narrow stretch of water separating the two sides.
Wu said a carrier group led by the Liaoning had recently conducted training in accordance with an annual training schedule, to test the performance of equipment. He give no other details. 

China considers proudly democratic Taiwan to be its sacred territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Chinese control.

Hong Kong media reported earlier this month that Fan, a former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission which President Xi Jinping heads and which runs the country's armed forces, was being investigated.
Asked whether Fan was indeed being probed, Defence Ministry spokesman Wu Qian referred reporters to a Jan. 18 article in the People's Liberation Army Daily about soldiers' training, in which Fan was cited as talking about the importance of drills.
""As for this rumor, I suggest you read the article in the Jan. 18 edition of the People's Liberation Army Daily, 'On using the fervor of troop training to answer the question of winning in battle',"" Wu told a monthly news briefing, without elaborating.
Pictures of Fan, looking relaxed in civilian clothes and writing calligraphy, also appeared on Chinese social media this week in an article about his post-retirement life.
Pictures of officials rumored to be in trouble are often leaked online as a way of denying anything untoward has happened to them in China.
The Defence Ministry has previously either declined to answer questions on officers suspected of corruption before the probes are actually announced, or said they don't know anything about the subject.

Ministry spokesman Wu Qian told a monthly news briefing that it had received an invite to the exercise and had sent a team to discuss initial arrangements with the United States. He did not elaborate.
The Rim of the Pacific exercise, known as RIMPAC, is billed as the world's largest international maritime exercise, held every two years in Hawaii in June and July, and China has attended previously.
Pentagon officials have long complained that China has not been candid enough about its rapid military build-up, whereas Chinese officials have accused Washington of viewing their country in suspicious, ""Cold War"" terms.
China decried last week's freedom of navigation operation by a U.S. warship in the South China Sea as an infringement of its sovereignty.
But the two countries also share a common interest in maintaining regional stability, and both have in recent years made efforts to counter mistrust, including holding humanitarian relief drills and setting up a military hotline to reduce the risk of miscalculations.

779,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Southeast Asian states launch intelligence pact to counter Islamist threat,"By Tom Allard
JAKARTA/NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Six Southeast Asian nations launched an intelligence pact on Thursday aimed at combating Islamist militants and improving co-operation on security threats, overcoming what analysts described as a high level of distrust.
Under the ""Our Eyes"" initiative, senior defense officials will meet every two weeks to swap information on militant groups and develop a common database of violent extremists.
The intelligence sharing arrangement comes after insurgents aligned to Islamic State laid siege to the southern Philippine city of Marawi last year.
Dozens of foreigners - most notably Indonesians and Malaysians - were among hundreds of militants who seized large parts of Marawi and engaged in a ferocious battle with Philippine forces that left much of the city in ruins and more than 1,100 people dead, according to government figures.
Some of the foreign fighters are believed to have traveled to Marawi via the porous maritime borders of the Sulu Sea, next to Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.
""This is something that seems so simple, but the effect is extraordinary,"" said Indonesian Defence Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu at the ""soft launch"" in Bali.
Ryacudu said intelligence sharing would help ensure another incident like Marawi did not occur and prevent the region from ""becoming like the Middle East"".
He added that the intelligence sharing was ""specifically for (combating) terrorism and radicalism"".
While led by military forces, the intelligence sharing would ""involve all parties"", including police, he said.
Along with Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Brunei - all members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - have signed up to the pact.
""It's a significant development,"" said John Blaxland, an intelligence analyst from the Australian National University.
""ASEAN has long struggled with getting beyond superficiality when it comes to collaboration on security matters.""
Blaxland said relations among ASEAN states had been bedeviled by a ""high level of distrust"" around intelligence cooperations.
""Operational imperatives are overcoming that and you are seeing that come to fruition with this mechanism.""
Another security analyst, who declined to be named, said a ""pact was better than not having a pact"" but added that entrenched mistrust between nations, and between different counter-terrorism agencies within nations, had to be overcome for it to be effective.
Ryacudu said other nations could be invited to join the ""Our Eyes"" intelligence network, whose name is inspired by the Five Eyes long-standing intelligence pact between the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
As well as other ASEAN nations, Ryacudu identified the United States, Australia and Japan as possible future members.
""Before joining, they will monitor first,"" he said.
Ryacudu asked for assistance when he met U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis on Tuesday in Jakarta.
""General Mattis said that he would help,"" he said. ""I am very glad because, after all, the U.S. has more sophisticated equipment.""
Bali itself was the target of Islamist militant bombings in 2002 in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians.

Thirty-one members and affiliates of a suspected clan allegedly run by the Spada family were picked up in raids starting at dawn in the Ostia coastal neighborhood, a police official said, while one suspect remained at large.
Ostia was the only one of Rome's 15 districts to be put under direct government control because of alleged mafia infiltration after a wide-ranging investigation dubbed ""Mafia Capital"" led to dozens of arrests in 2014. 
The spotlight returned to Ostia in November when Roberto Spada, gym owner and brother of a convicted mobster, was filmed headbutting a journalist who asked whether he supported a far-right group.
The city's mayor Virginia Raggi thanked police, prosecutors and the Interior Minister for the arrests, writing on Twitter:
""Rome gets a new lease of life with the operation against the Spada clan in Ostia ... Together we say no to criminality. #MafiaGetOutofRome.""

SEGGIANO DI PIOLTELLO, Italy (Reuters) - A train derailment near Italy's financial capital Milan killed at least three people and left 13 people seriously injured, the government said in a statement on Thursday.
Several carriages of a regional train operated by Trenord derailed early in the morning at the Pioltello Limito station, less than 20 km (13 miles) outside the station Milan, Italian state-owned rail company Ferrovie dello Stato said. It did not give further details.
""There currently are three dead, five severely injured and eight injured in 'code yellow', all of which in hospital,"" the body representing the Interior Ministry in Milan said in an emailed statement.
Search and rescue efforts ended and all those who presented minor injuries were given shelter in a nearby gymnasium.
The head of Milan police said an investigation has been opened, with railway police interrogating the train driver and first evidence pointing at either a collapse of the tracks or a problem with a track switch.
A spokesperson for Trenord said the train was travelling at normal speed as it was approaching the station.
Train circulation between Milan and the nearby city of Brescia was halted after the accident, Ferrovie dello Stato added. 

Trenord is a joint venture between railway operator FNM and Trenitalia, a unit of Ferrovie dello Stato.

Groups critical of the film have accused its director, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, of distorting history by portraying a Muslim ruler as the ""lover"" of the Hindu Queen Padmavati of the Rajput warrior clan. The filmmakers deny the accusation.
Thursday's tumult came as the Indian capital hosted leaders from ten Southeast Asian nations on the first day of a summit marking 25 years of ties with the region, and just a day before an annual parade and celebrations of India's Republic Day.
Television broadcast images of shops attacked by protesters in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, and of people waving swords and burning tires in the eastern state of Bihar.
""If you have freedom of writers, freedom of expression, we too have freedom of protest,"" Lokendra Singh Kalvi, head of the Shri Rajput Karni Sena, a conservative body at the forefront of the protests, told Reuters by telephone.
Indian films that touch upon the historical relationships of Hindus, who belong to the country's majority religion, and Muslim leaders are often controversial.
In Raipur, capital of the central state of Chhattisgarh, the leader of another Rajput group, the Sarwa Kshatriya Mahasabha, was among 30 people police arrested on Wednesday, some of whom had protested outside a cinema. They were later released.
Police said they had made arrangements to ensure protests remained peaceful.
""We have fool-proof deployments in all the places,"" Amresh Mishra, a superintendent of police in Raipur, told Reuters. ""We feel the screening will pass off peacefully."" 
Television showed images of children cowering in fear on the floor of a schoolbus targeted by protesters in Gurugram, about 30 km (19 miles) from New Delhi, on Wednesday. 
The lavishly-produced ""Padmaavat"", a 163-minute film, centers on a Muslim ruler, Alauddin Khilji, and his battle with the Rajput king of Chittor, over the king's wife, Rani Padmavati.
The film-makers have repeatedly said the film takes its inspiration from an epic poem of the same name, but their assurances have failed to assuage the Karni Sena group.
India's Supreme Court last week cleared the way for the film's release and has blocked state governments from imposing bans on it.
Fears of violence mean the film has yet to open in several places, from the western state of Gujarat to central Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, all usually big markets for India's film industry.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rules Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.
""It is a huge loss for us, because this is a big film that we would have liked to show in our theatres, Sandeep Jain, who owns seven theatres in Madhya Pradesh, told Reuters by telephone.
""But there has been no support from the local administration.""

Twitter posts by Fasih Ahmed, the scion of a wealthy family that owns the local Newsweek Pakistan magazine, sparked outrage on social media at a time of deep anger in the conservative Muslim nation over the rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl.
""The sexual abuse of children will always exist. You can never eliminate it. Sometimes it leads to great art. So there's also that,"" Ahmed wrote in a now deleted tweet on January 18. 
In another deleted tweet, Ahmed wrote that unlike being raped by former U.S. President Barack Obama, being raped by actor Tom Cruise is ""everyone's dream come true"", adding that everything is subjective.
Newsweek on Wednesday tweeted that it was ""reviewing"" its relationship with the Pakistan publication, ""which operates under a license agreement"".
Newsweek, which is owned by American digital news company IBT Media, and Newsweek Pakistan did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. Ahmed could not be reached for comment. 
After the social media backlash against Ahmed, a prominent Pakistani literary festival held in the central city of Lahore announced that it had received ""several complaints"" and had accepted Ahmed's resignation from its board of governors.
Ahmed's father, Iqbal Z. Ahmed, is one of Pakistan's most prominent businessmen and his brother is the founder of the Lahore Literature Festival.
Initially Ahmed responded to online criticism by saying the rest of the country was in denial about child abuse.
""Child sexual abuse has always happened, is happening, and will continue,"" he tweeted, adding that those showing outrage on social media or participating in vigils were not actually helping the victims.
Ahmed deleted the offensive posts from his twitter page and late on Wednesday posted an apology.
""My tweets of yesterday were coming from anger, were poorly phrased, and misread. I'm sorry to have upset the people who have survived child abuse,"" Ahmed tweeted.
Ahmed's comments drew outrage across Pakistan, which is reeling from the shock of the grisly rape and murder of Zainab Ansari, the seven-year-old whose body was recovered from a dumpster in the central town of Kasur.
Protests erupted nationwide after the Zainab’s body was found. Her murder highlighted a series of pedophilia-related murders in the town.
On Tuesday, police announced that they had caught a suspect who had confessed to a number of other murders. 

""Child abuse is pure evil. Zainab needs to be a watershed moment. Talk about it. Deal with it. Don't shame those who have to live with it,"" Ahmed added in one of his apologetic tweets.

787,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>",Bulgarian government survives no-confidence vote over corruption,"SOFIA (Reuters) - The Bulgarian government on Thursday survived a parliamentary vote of no-confidence brought by the opposition Socialists over what they said was a lack of progress in fighting rampant corruption.
Some 103 deputies in the 240-seat parliament voted in favor of the first no-confidence vote against the center-right coalition cabinet led by Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, while 131 deputies opposed it.
The vote was overcome easily as the Borissov's ruling GERB party holds a majority, albeit it fragile, in the chamber with its nationalist partners and also enjoys the support of a small populist party.
Bulgaria, currently holding the European Union's rotating presidency, ranks as the bloc's most corrupt member state according to Transparency International's 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index. 
The Socialists accused the government of doing close to nothing since taking office last May to bring high level corrupt officials behind bars and for passing anti-graft legislation which they believe would not yield the needed results.
The European Commission has repeatedly rebuked Bulgaria, an ex-communist nation of 7.1 million, for failing to uproot graft and for being too slow to overhaul its judiciary.
Corruption has reduced much needed foreign investment in the country and is among the main reasons for some fellow European Union countries to oppose Bulgaria's entry into the Schengen zone of passport-free travel and to the euro zone.
The government says new legislation will give the tools the country needs to crack down on graft. Speaking to EU deputies last week, Borissov pledged to deliver tangible results in the fight against corruption in two to three years. 

Analysts say Borissov's government is likely to withstand pressures in the near term but it would face difficult months ahead in trying to balance the interests within the ruling coalition and pressures coming from environmental protests.

Tajani is a former EU commissioner and a member of Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party, the highest-polling group in a center-right coalition favored to win the most seats at the March 4 vote.
Four-times premier Berlusconi, who cannot run again himself due to a 2013 tax fraud conviction, said on RTL radio he had three candidates in mind, but named only Tajani.
""If it were possible to have Antonio Tajani as premier it would be a wonderful choice, he has always shown total and absolute loyalty to our principles and ideas, and to Silvio Berlusconi,"" he told RTL radio.
Current opinion polls suggest no one party or coalition will win enough seats to be able to govern alone, raising the possibility of further talks after the vote to build a majority.

The center-right coalition, which also includes the Northern League and Brothers of Italy, have agreed that whichever party wins the most votes can pick the next premier.

The Sanchi, which was sailing from Iran to South Korea, carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate, an ultra light crude, sank on Jan. 14 after drifting ablaze for more than a week. The ship's crew of 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis are believed to have been killed.

The Freedom Party, junior coalition partner to Sebastian Kurz's conservatives, was founded by former Nazis and has repeatedly excluded members in Nazi scandals. It says it has left its Nazi past behind.
Kurz has vowed to focus on fighting anti-Semitism after Israel said it would not have direct contact with Freedom Party officials although the Foreign, Interior and Defence Ministers all entered cabinet on the far right ticket.
""We do not want anything to do with such people and we do not want to commemorate the people who died in the Shoah (Nazi holocaust) with such people,"" IKG chief Oskar Deutsch said on ORF radio.
""One should think about what kind of people are sitting in a government and what kind of people get voted into a parliament.""
The Freedom Party gained third place with 26 percent of votes in parliamentary elections in October. 
The conservative president of parliament, Wolfgang Sobotka, said he could understand the IKG's behavior but also felt it was ""a pity that some people are not coming.""
Earlier this month, Interior Minister Herbert Kickl of the FPO said asylum seekers should be ""concentrated"" in special centers to help the authorities process their applications swiftly.
For many observers, Kickl's wording evoked Nazi-era concentration camps, where Nazis held and killed millions of Jews, political dissenters, disabled people, Roma and Sinti during World War Two.
Nazi Germany annexed Austria, where Adolf Hitler was born, in 1938.
This week, the FPO's top candidate in elections in the province of Lower Austria, Udo Landbauer, suspended his membership in a student fraternity he helped lead when it emerged the group distributed song books with Nazi content.
Landbauer said the judiciary had to deal with the case, but added the book in question had been produced when he was 11 years old, meaning he could not be held responsible for it.
""If you read Hitler's Mein Kampf, for example, you also cannot say you did not know about it,"" Deutsch said of Landbauer, calling for his resignation.
Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen told ORF radio he was stunned about the Nazi songs in the publication and that all members of the fraternity must have known about them.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - South Korea has prepared ""all contingency scenarios"" in case North Korea stages another weapons test even as the two countries hold a series of talks and mutual visits around next month's Winter Olympics, South Korea's foreign minister said.
""We go into these discussions with a clear understanding of what might be possible"", Kang Kyung-wha told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
""Another provocation is always a possibility. So we approach these talks with all contingency scenarios in mind and are prepared to deal with whatever might happen, but overall it's a good thing"".
Kang, who is in Davos to discuss recent progress in inter-Korean talks and boost awareness of the Olympics, did not discuss details of the scenarios that South Korea was prepared for.
After their first formal talks in more than two years this month, officials from the two Koreas are making visits to each other to facilitate the North's participation in the Olympics to be held in the South's alpine resort town of Pyeongchang. 
Pyongyang is waging a publicity campaign around its attendance, calling on Thursday for ""all Koreans at home and abroad"" to promote inter-Korean cooperation.
Kim Jong Un's regime has also set a new anniversary to mark the formation of its military on Feb. 8 - the day before the start of the Games - and analysts say it may mark it with a large military parade.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who will represent the United States at the Olympics, said on Tuesday he would seek to counter what he called an effort by North Korea to ""hijack"" the Games with a propaganda campaign. 
Seoul has rejected that criticism, saying the Olympics will help defuse tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
""This is an opportunity for engagement and a peaceful engagement around the Olympic Games, and we just need to make the best of it,"" Kang said in the interview, which took place on Wednesday.
Last year, North Korea conducted dozens of missile launches and its sixth and largest nuclear test in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions as it raced towards its goal of developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States.
Another test or similar provocation ""would be not acceptable"", she said. ""And further provocations will only lead to further pressure and sanctions"".
HOPES FOR FURTHER DIALOGUE
With the North joining the Games, South Korea's liberal President Moon Jae-in tackled his immediate goal of curbing tensions and reopening cross-border dialogue. 
But analysts say turning the thaw into longer-term detente will be far more daunting, as the North rejected to discuss its nuclear weapons program with the South during earlier talks. 
""The period of non-engagement with North Korea has been too long,"" Kang said. 
""There is hope and there is expectation that this will lead to further discussions of issues between South and North Korea and that dialogue will create the momentum for dialogue on the North Korean nuclear issue as well."" 
In an apparent bid to court the North, which calls joint South Korea-U.S. military exercises a ""rehearsal for war"", Seoul had proposed a delay in the drills during the Olympics. 
The proposal was based on the ""spirit of the Olympic Games"", Kang said, but declined to elaborate on whether the South would resume the drills after the event. 
""We're on the same page on all fronts (with the United States)"", she said. ""So we will see how the next two months will unfold.""
Kang said China and Russia can ""do more"" to improve the enforcement of the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) sanctions against North Korea in areas such as the interdiction of ships suspected of conducting illegal transfers of oil and coal at sea. 
The U.S. Treasury on Wednesday newly blacklisted nine entities, 16 people and six North Korean vessels it accused of helping the North's weapons programs.
""This is now mandatory by the latest UNSC resolution, if you have information that illicit transfers are being done ship-to-ship, that's a clear violation and you have to stop that,"" Kang said. 

""China and Russia are members of the Security Council - they have in fact the primary responsibility to see their decisions on the sanctions are implemented.""

""These allegations are false, categorically untrue - every one of them,"" Progressive Conservative party leader Patrick Brown said at a news conference held a few minutes before CTV aired the report in its 10 p.m. evening newscast. ""I will defend myself as hard as I can with all means at my disposal.""
Brown is running to unseat Ontario's Liberal Premier, Kathleen Wynne, in a June election in Canada's most populous province, home to Toronto and the nation's capital Ottawa.
The CTV report included allegations from two women who said he made sexual advances towards them in separate incidents at his home.
CTV did not identify the women or show their faces. Reuters was unable to verify the claims made by CTV.
One of the women said she met Brown in a bar more than 10 years ago when she was in high school, that he invited her to his home, provided her with alcohol, even though she was under the drinking age, exposed himself and asked her to perform a sexual act.
The second, who said she worked for Brown in his office when he was a member of parliament, described an incident in which he kissed her when she was drunk.
Five aides to Brown said on Twitter that they had resigned after learning of the allegations earlier on Wednesday.
Three of them said in a joint statement that after speaking to him they had advised him to step down as party leader, but he had declined to do so.
Andrew Scheer, leader of the federal Conservative Party, called for an investigation into the claims.
""The allegations against the leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives are extremely serious and should be investigated fully,"" he said in a statement.
Brown said that he would report to work on Thursday and fight vigorously to defend himself.

""I know that public opinion moves fast,"" he said at the press conference. ""I've instructed my attorneys to insure that these allegations are addressed where they should be - in the court of law.""

Larung Gar, a sprawling Buddhist center of learning and prayer in the mountains of southwestern Sichuan province, has already been reduced in size through an eight-month program of demolition and expulsion that ended in April 2017, HRW said.
The government is now splitting the center into two sections, an academy and a monastery, divided by a wall, according to an English-language translation of a document shared by HRW, which they said was received in August 2017.
The measures include quotas for recruitment, a management system of ""real-name registration"" and tags for monks and nuns, as well as placing 97 Communist Party cadres, who are required to be atheist, in top finance, security and admission roles.
Monastic sources told HRW that a similar system would be set up in the monastery and that a large building had been constructed to house the cadres. 
Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the document or the claims from HRW sources.
""The administrative takeover of Larung Gar by party officials shows that the government's aim was not merely to reduce numbers at the settlement,"" said Sophie Richardson, U.S.-based China director for HRW.
""Chinese authorities are also imposing pervasive control and surveillance over every level of activity within religious communities,"" she said.
China's religious affairs bureau did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
China has denied carrying out demolitions at Larung Gar, saying the work is to tackle fire and safety hazards, as well as to ""reconstruct"" old buildings.
Tibetan-populated areas of western China, including in Sichuan, had been at the epicenter of protests against Chinese rule, which included acts of self-immolation, although reported cases have declined in the past two years.
HRW's Richardson said the micromanagement of Larung Gar encroaches on religious freedom and is likely to fuel resentment against Beijing.
Chinese law promises freedom of religion but authorities keep a close eye on religious believers and institutions, especially in areas such as Tibet where faith is considered a potential challenge to Communist Party rule.

New regulations due to take effect at the end of this month are set to expand state oversight of religious institutions. In particular, schools will train future generations of China's religious leaders.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Australians plan to mark Australia Day, Jan. 26, with mass protests, demanding the date of the national holiday be changed given its links to colonization and the ill-treatment of indigenous Aborigines.
Australia Day marks the date the British ""First Fleet"" sailed into Sydney Harbour in 1788 and declared the land unoccupied, despite encountering Aborigines, and established settlements. Aborigines have occupied the Australian continent for some 50,000 years.
Aborigines refer to Jan. 26 as ""Invasion Day"" and Australian schools and some universities teach both views, as the debate over how to reconcile the country's past continues.
""We expect at least 10,000-12,000 people, twice as many as last year, to come out and call for invasion day to be abolished,"" said Aborigine Raymond Weatherall, an organizer of a rally in Sydney. Protests will held across Australia's largest cities.
More than half of all Australians support changing the date of the national holiday, a poll by The Australia Institute think tank showed last week. And analysts expect that number to rise as consciousness of the issue continues to increase.
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, under pressure from his conservative back bench and populist right-wing politicians such as Pauline Hanson, has said he supports celebrating Australia Day on Jan. 26.
Australia's third largest political party, the Australian Greens, has said it will spearhead a campaign to change the date of the national holiday. 
""Australia must acknowledge our past. We must understand the impact on our first peoples,"" Richard Di Natale, senator and leader of the Australian Greens, told Reuters.
""Until we do that, we will never be able to truly reconcile our history with who we are today, a multicultural nation.""
The country's 700,000 or so indigenous people track near the bottom of its 23 million citizens in almost every economic and social indicator.
Despite millions of dollars of expenditure, the government said last year its plan to improve the lives of its indigenous population was on course for failure.

Odebrecht has been accused of using bribes in several Latin American countries to win lucrative business, and in 2016 company executives admitted making illicit payments to secure a Guatemalan highway contract in 2012.
An investigation by Brazilian and Guatemalan prosecutors with the U.N.-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) revealed this month that ex-infrastructure minister Alejandro Sinibaldi had agreed to take $19.5 million to arrange for Odebrecht to secure the $300 million contract.
In the end, Sinibaldi, who has been fugitive since mid-2016, received $17.9 million, the investigation found.
Guatemalan attorney general Thelma Aldana told a news conference that Odebrecht had agreed to pay Guatemala that sum as a result of its ""illicit actions"".
Representatives for Odebrecht could not immediately be reached for comment.

The U.S. State Department said last week that Washington would withhold $65 million it had planned to pay the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), saying it needed to make unspecified reforms.
The leaders of the aid groups warned of ""dire consequences"" if the cut was maintained, according to the letter, a copy of which was given to Reuters.
“We are deeply concerned by the humanitarian consequences of this decision on life-sustaining assistance to children, women and men in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and the West Bank and Gaza Strip,"" the letter said.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert on Thursday denied the move was to punish Palestinians, who have been sharply critical of President Donald Trump's announcement last month that he would move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.
She repeated the U.S. view that UNRWA needs reform, saying there are a lot more refugees in the program than previously, and that ""money coming in from other countries needs to increase as well to continue paying for all those refugees.""
Eric Schwartz, president of Refugees International and former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration, said the comments by Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, was aimed at punishing Palestinian political leaders and forcing them to make political concessions.
""But it is wrong to punish political leaders by denying life-sustaining aid to civilians. This is a dangerous and striking departure from U.S. policy on international humanitarian assistance which conflicts starkly with values that U.S. administrations and the American people have embraced,"" Schwartz said in the letter.
The State Department also said on Thursday that the United States would not provide a separate $45 million in food aid for Palestinians that it pledged last month as part of the West Bank/Gaza Emergency Appeal led by UNRWA.
Nauert said the United States had made clear to UNRWA that the $45 million was a pledge aimed at helping the agency with ""forecasting,"" but it was not a guarantee.
Trump said in a Twitter post on Jan. 2 that the United States gives the Palestinians hundreds of millions of dollars a year, ""but get no appreciation or respect.""
The decisions to curb funding are likely to compound the difficulty of reviving Israeli-Palestinian peace talks as well as further undermine Arabs' faith that the United States can act as an impartial arbitrator.

The last talks collapsed in 2014, partly due to Israel's opposition to an attempted unity pact between the Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas, and because of Israeli settlement building on occupied land that Palestinians seek for a state, among other factors.

""We can confirm that there were four U.S. citizens killed and two injured. We offer our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who were killed and wish for the speedy recovery of those wounded,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
Glenn Selig, a spokesman for Trump campaign adviser Rick Gates, was among the Americans who were killed, CNN reported, citing a statement by Selig's company, Selig Multimedia. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
Selig represented Gates, who has been charged in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion with President Donald Trump's campaign.
""Glenn was in Kabul on a potential success story involving Afghanistan and its steps to battle extremism. The focus was highlighting the country's new president and constructing a democracy forum event for Afghani women,"" Selig Multimedia said in a statement, according to CNN.
At least 20 people were killed when five gunman dressed in Afghan army uniforms stormed the Kabul hotel on Saturday night. Seven Ukrainians and one German were among the dead.
The Taliban, which attacked the same hotel in 2011, claimed responsibility for the attack, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.

TUNIS (Reuters) - The United Nations Libya mission said it was alarmed by reports of ""brutal and outrageous summary executions"" in the eastern city of Benghazi on Wednesday, after pictures emerged appearing to show at least nine people being shot dead at the site of a twin car bombing.
The U.N. Libya mission, UNSMIL, suggested in a tweet that the gunman was Mahmoud al-Werfalli, a special forces commander wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for allegedly carrying out a number of similar killings.
""(The U.N.) demands the handing over of Mahmoud al-Werfalli immediately to (the ICC) as it documented at least 5 similar cases, in 2017 alone, carried out or ordered by al-Werfalli,"" UNSMIL said on its Twitter account.
""Those responsible for committing or ordering summary executions are criminally liable under international law.""
Reuters could not independently confirm the gunman's identity. 
The photos, which were posted on social media and in local media, appear to show executions in front of Benghazi's Bayaat al-Radwan mosque, where a twin car bombing on Tuesday left at least 35 people dead.
One of the pictures shows a gunman dressed in military camouflage, pointing a weapon at the head of the first of a row of blindfolded men kneeling in blue jumpsuits in front of damaged mosque gates.
Another photo shows all but three of the people slumped forward on the road as the gunman makes his way along the line. It was unclear who the men were.
Al-Werfalli is from an elite unit attached to Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), which controls Benghazi and battled Islamists and other opponents in the city until late last year.
After the ICC said it was seeking al-Werfalli's arrest in August, the LNA announced that it was investigating him and had detained him, though his whereabouts were unclear. The special forces dismissed the ICC warrant.
A spokesman for the LNA could not immediately be reached for comment on the pictures. 
The pictures were posted as U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame visited Benghazi on Wednesday, meeting Haftar at a military compound near the city and expressing condemnation of the car bombing.
Haftar, a divisive figure in Libya, has increasingly been courted by the international community as he has gained power on the ground. He is considered a likely candidate in elections that the U.N. has said it hopes can be organized by the end of 2018.

803,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 06:28PM ET</span>","Venezuela's presidential battle begins, Maduro favorite","By Andrew Cawthorne and Andreina Aponte
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's presidential election race has begun with favorite and incumbent Nicolas Maduro signaling a nationalist, ""anti-Trump"" campaign while his demoralized foes scramble to find a viable candidate for a vote they predict will be unfair.
Critics of the 55-year-old Maduro, who succeeded Hugo Chavez in 2013, say he has ruined a once prosperous oil economy, turned Venezuela into a dictatorship and skewed the election system to perpetuate power for his Socialist Party.
Government officials say they are fighting a U.S.-led right-wing conspiracy determined to end socialism in Latin America, hobble Venezuela's economy, and steal its oil wealth.
""Donald Trump is not the boss of Venezuela!"" thundered Maduro at a rally late on Tuesday. He spoke hours after the pro-government Constituent Assembly, a legislative superbody, announced the vote would be held by April 30.
Maduro confirmed on Wednesday that he would stand for re-election. 
The president's approval ratings have plunged during a crushing four-year recession caused by failed economic policies such as decade-old currency controls and the fall in global oil prices since 2014.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence called Maduro a ""dictator"" on Twitter on Wednesday, adding that snap elections were ""undemocratic, unconstitutional, and globally opposed."" 
Foreign sanctions against Maduro's government, including a U.S. prohibition on investors' dealing with any new Venezuelan debt, have exacerbated the grim panorama as millions suffer food and medicine shortages and the world's highest inflation.
But with Maduro having survived massive protests last year and consolidated his grip, the international pressure has now given him a powerful rallying cry to seek re-election.
""The people rule in Venezuela, not empires,"" he said at Tuesday's rally, going straight into campaign mode with jingles from past elections. ""I'm ready. ... We're going to win big.""
""MADURO'S FARCE""
Venezuela's opposition, which brought hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets last year in an attempt to oust Maduro, is in a quandary. Its most popular figures - including Leopoldo Lopez and Henrique Capriles - are prevented from standing. Some are in jail, others are in exile or barred from politics.
""The election will be held on Maduro's terms, allowing him to ensure his victory,"" the Eurasia consultancy said. ""All of this will come at a cost of increased international isolation, something that the government seems willing to stomach if the tradeoff is to lose power.""
The most militant of government opponents believe it is useless to fight the socialists at the polls, given the election board - whose head is on U.S. and European Union sanctions lists - favors the government and turns a blind eye to use of state resources for campaign purposes.
Electoral council documents seen by Reuters appeared to show pro-government numbers were inflated in last year's vote for the Constituent Assembly, and the opposition produced strong evidence of fraud in Bolivar state during governor elections.
The government denied any voting fraud, saying its election system is the cleanest in the world.
""The dictatorship does not want free elections. No one in Venezuela or abroad should support another of Maduro's farces,"" said Antonio Ledezma, a hardline opposition leader who recently escaped house arrest to flee to Spain.
If militants campaign for a boycott of the election, that would complicate plans by the already disparate Democratic Unity (MUD) coalition to hold a primary election to choose its best candidate. Leaders of the major MUD parties were meeting later on Wednesday to discuss strategy and possible primaries.
""To participate or not, vote or not, protest or not? If we're not united, no strategy will work. If we go forward together, nobody can beat us,"" said young opposition leader Hasler Iglesias.
Two opposition leaders, Henry Ramos and Henri Falcon, have already announced presidential aspirations. But both are divisive figures within the opposition: Ramos is seen as too old-school by many, while Falcon is viewed with suspicion due to his origins within the ruling ""Chavismo"" movement.
Announcing his would-be candidacy on Wednesday, Falcon said the government was incapable of resolving the country's crisis, adding, ""We need to get rid of this rubbish government, democratically.""
Given the dismal state of the economy and years of bitter political standoff, many Venezuelans are fed up with all parties and yearning for a fresh face.

Some have been calling for Lorenzo Mendoza, the long-haired billionaire head of Venezuela's main private food company Polar, to stand, but he has given no hint he will.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors should use their financial clout to force internet firms into taking more responsibility for stopping militants and pedophiles using their platforms, British Prime Minister Theresa May will say on Thursday.
May will make the call at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where the world's most powerful leaders, investors and executives are gathered to discuss the global agenda. 
""Technology companies still need to go further in stepping up to their responsibilities for dealing with harmful and illegal online activity,"" May will say according to advance extracts of her speech. 
""These companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content.""
May, a former interior minister whose 18 months in power has been marked by a series of deadly attacks, has repeatedly called on firms like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter to do more to deal with extremist and harmful content.
On Thursday, she will say that while some progress has been made on the automatic removal of harmful content, investors should exert their financial influence to force further action.
""Investors can play a vital role by considering the social impact of the companies they are investing in. They can use their influence to ensure these issues are taken seriously,"" she will say.
Data published last week showed social media companies had accelerated removals of online hate speech in the face of a potential European Union crackdown.
The British government has so far met quiet resistance from tech leaders like Facebook, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Twitter, and critics say ending encryption will weaken security for legitimate actions and open a back door for government snooping.
In December, responding to a government threat to use taxes to push firms into action, Facebook said it had invested millions of pounds in people and technology to identify and remove terrorist content.
YouTube, which is owned by Google, said in December it was doing more every day to tackle violent extremism.
On Thursday, May will demand a cross-industry approach to the problem, including smaller firms. She singled out messaging service Telegram as example of how small platforms ""can quickly become home to criminals and terrorists"". 
""No one wants to be known as 'the terrorists' platform' or the first choice app for pedophiles,"" she will say.

805,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 05:37PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Richardson quits Myanmar's 'whitewash' Rohingya crisis panel,"By Bill Tarrant
YANGON (Reuters) - Veteran U.S. diplomat Bill Richardson has resigned from an international panel set up by Myanmar to advise on the Rohingya crisis, saying it was conducting a ""whitewash"" and accusing the country's leader Aung San Suu Kyi of lacking ""moral leadership"".
Richardson, a former Clinton administration cabinet member, quit as the 10-member advisory board was making its first visit to western Rakhine State, from where nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled in recent months.
""The main reason I am resigning is that this advisory board is a whitewash,"" Richardson told Reuters in an interview, adding he did not want to be part of ""a cheerleading squad for the government"".
Richardson said he got into an argument with Suu Kyi during a meeting on Monday with other members of the board, when he brought up the case of two Reuters reporters who are on trial accused of breaching the country's Officials Secrets Act.
He said Suu Kyi's response was ""furious"", saying the case of the reporters ""was not part of the work of the advisory board"". The argument continued at a dinner later that evening, the former New Mexico governor said.
Neither Suu Kyi nor her spokesman Zaw Htay, who is also the government spokesman, responded to requests for comment.
Reporters Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, had worked on Reuters coverage of the crisis in Rakhine, from where 688,000 Rohingya have fled an army crackdown on insurgents since late August, according to estimates by the United Nations.
They were detained on Dec. 12 after they had been invited to meet police officers over dinner in Yangon. The government has cited police as saying they were arrested for possessing secret documents relating to the security situation in Rakhine.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert called Richardson's decision to resign from the board and his reasons for doing so ""cause for concern"", but noted he had been acting as a private citizen in joining the board and visiting Myanmar, which is also known as Burma.
""The Burmese government has pledged to implement the final recommendations of the Annan Commission, and we have urged the government to fulfill its pledge as a matter of urgency,"" she said.
""Ultimately, the Burmese government and military have the authority to determine whether the Advisory Board will succeed,"" Nauert said. ""The United States has made clear that we are willing to support good faith efforts to implement the Annan Commission recommendations.”
The Advisory Board for the Committee for Implementation of the Recommendations on Rakhine State was set up by Myanmar last year, to advise on enacting the findings of an earlier commission headed by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
The armed forces have been accused by Rohingya witnesses and human rights activists of carrying out killings, rapes and arson in a campaign senior officials in the United Nations and United States have described as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar rejects that label and has denied nearly all the allegations. 
Richardson said he was also ""taken aback by the vigor with which the media, the United Nations, human rights groups and in general the international community were disparaged"" during the last three days of meetings the board held with Myanmar officials.
""She's not getting good advice from her team,"" Richardson said of Suu Kyi, whom he said he has known since the 1980s. ""I like her enormously and respect her. But she has not shown moral leadership on the Rakhine issue and the allegations made, and I regret that.""
Suu Kyi's national security adviser, Thaung Tun, told Reuters he had escorted the other board members on a trip to Rakhine on Wednesday, but that Richardson had not taken part.
""He said he was unhappy about the situation but I am not sure what he was unhappy about,"" he said. ""This is just the initial stage, this is the start of a whole year of business so I don't know what happened to make him feel like that.""
PANEL CHAIRMAN SLAMMED
Before Richardson quit the advisory board had 10 members, including five from overseas, chaired by former Thai Deputy Prime Minister Surakiart Sathirathai.
Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and energy secretary in the Clinton administration, also had harsh words for Surakiart. 
The board chairman, he said, was not ""genuinely committed"" to implementing recommendations regarding the issues of Rohingya safety, citizenship, peace, stability and development.
""He parroted the dangerous and untrue notion that international NGOs employ radicals and that humanitarian agencies are providing material support to ARSA,"" Richardson said, referring to Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army militants.
Surakiart was traveling with other members of the board in Rakhine and did not respond to requests for comment.
Another board member, former South African Defence Minister Roelof Meyer, told Reuters the visit to Rakhine had been ""very constructive"".
""If anybody would say that we are just a rubber stamp or a voice on behalf of the government that would be completely untrue, unfair,"" he said. ""We haven't done any recommendations so far.""
Other members of the board, which also includes British doctor and politician Lord Darzi of Denham and speaker of the Swedish parliament Urban Ahlin, were not immediately available for comment.
Richardson said he declined to join the advisory board's tour of a new repatriation camp in Rakhine State on Wednesday, instead traveling to Yangon.
MASS GRAVE
Myanmar's military said earlier this month its soldiers had taken part in the killings of 10 captured Muslim ""terrorists"" during insurgent attacks at the beginning of September, after Buddhist villagers had forced the captured men into a grave the villagers had dug.
It was a rare acknowledgment of wrongdoing during its operations in Rakhine by the Myanmar military, which said legal action would be taken against members of the security forces who violated their rules of engagement and the villagers involved. 
Richardson said he has asked the board to recommend that the Myanmar government set up an independent investigation into ""the mass grave issue, especially as it pertained to ... the involvement of the military"". He did not say how the board had responded.
The Rohingya crisis erupted after ARSA attacks on security posts in Rakhine on Aug. 25 triggered a fierce military response. Myanmar says its troops were engaged in legitimate counterinsurgency operations.

The U.N. on Wednesday called on Myanmar to give aid agencies unhindered access to camps it has built for tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees after agreeing a deal with Bangladesh on their return.

The vote will mark the party's electoral debut after thousands of members handed in their weapons under the deal signed with the government of President Juan Manuel Santos in 2016, which ended more than 52 years of war. 
The group was previously known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia but is now the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force, preserving their FARC initials. 
The deal guaranteed the party five seats in the Senate and five seats in the lower house through 2026, regardless of the number of votes it receives in elections. 
""We aspire not just to the 10 places, five senators and five representatives, but to many more. We are very optimistic and trust it will be more than ten,"" Julian Gallo Cubillos, better known by his chosen rebel name Carlos Antonio Lozada, told journalists. Gallo is a Senate candidate and member of the FARC's party leadership. 
Of the 74 candidates for the party is backing, 23 are running for Senate seats and 51 for the lower house. Long-time rebel leader Rodrigo Londono, known by his nom de guerre Timochenko, is the party's candidate for presidential elections in May.
The FARC will present a 10-point platform at a campaign launch event this weekend, Gallo added, with policies focused on fighting poverty and unemployment and improving health and education.
Many Colombians remain angry at the FARC, infamous for kidnappings, bombings and displacements, and believe they should be in prison, not running for congressional seats. 
The peace deal was narrowly rejected by voters in 2016 before being modified and passed through Congress. Recent surveys show little support for the party.
Two party members were killed in Antioquia province last week after a campaign event. Thirty ex-fighters have been murdered by people hoping to destabilize the peace process, the group said at the time.
Former rebels have repeatedly raised concerns they may be assassinated by right-wing paramilitary gangs or drug traffickers, in a replay of about 5,000 targeted killings during the 1980s, when the group first attempted to found the Patriotic Union political party.

808,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 04:03PM ET</span>",France says U.N.-led Syria peace talks in Vienna represent 'last hope',"By John Irish and Shadia Nasralla
PARIS/VIENNA (Reuters) - France's foreign minister said on Wednesday there was no sign of a political solution for Syria other than U.N.-led peace talks in Vienna and they were the ""last hope"".
Several attempts at U.N.-sponsored peacemaking have fallen flat as Syrian government forces backed by Russia and Iran have recovered large swathes of the country from rebels since 2015.
Government forces recently escalated offensives against two remaining rebel pockets, Idlib in the northwest and eastern Ghouta near Damascus, while Turkey has poured troops into the north to fight Kurdish militias who have carved out regional autonomy and are seen by Ankara as a menace to its security.
Having regained the upper hand in the almost seven-year civil war, President Bashar al-Assad appears far from ready to negotiate with foes at all, let alone step down as part of any peaceful solution as rebel groups have demanded.
""Today, there is no political perspective that presents itself, other than - and it's the last hope - the meeting that will be held in Vienna tomorrow under the auspices of the United Nations, where the belligerents will be present and where we hope a peace agenda will be mapped out,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told lawmakers in Paris. 
Staffan de Mistura, the U.N. Special Envoy for Syria, invited the Syrian government and opposition to a two-day meeting in the Austrian capital with the goal of addressing issues related to a new constitution.
""By definition I am optimistic...It's a very critical moment. Very, very critical,"" De Mistura told reporters in Vienna, adding that both sides had promised to send full delegations. 
The chief negotiator for the Syrian opposition, Nasr Hariri, said the next two days would be a real test for all sides to prove their commitment to a political solution rather than a military one.
SEPARATE RUSSIAN PEACE BID 
The Vienna meeting comes a few days before Russia convenes its own Syrian peace congress in Sochi. Western and some Arab states believe Moscow aims to create a parallel political track that would undermine the United Nations and lay groundwork for a solution more suitable to the Damascus government. 
Hariri said the opposition would decide over the next two days whether it will attend the Sochi meeting, telling reporters in Vienna he was still lacking information on the Russian-led initiative.
""Is Russia unable to really bring the regime to the negotiating table or does it not want to bring them to the negotiating table?"" Hariri said.
""The main place to achieve a political solution, a political transition is in the UN-led process (in the Geneva framework)... It is very dangerous to enter in any parallel initiative and ignore the main political process which is here in the UN-led process."" 
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday about Moscow's role in ensuring ""the Assad regime plays a constructive role in the U.N.-led Geneva process,"" a State Department statement said.
De Mistura has presided over a sporadic series of talks in Geneva, with a mandate to discuss new elections, reformed governance, a new constitution and the fight against terrorism.
But he has not managed to coax the warring sides into speaking face-to-face, and it was only in the eighth round in December that the rebel opposition united in one delegation, raising modest hopes for direct talks.
But the Syrian government delegation objected to the opposition's tough line on the future of Assad, and the talks achieved nothing.
The scales tipped even more Assad's way after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew aid to mainstream rebels in favor of focusing on the fight against Islamic State militants, whose ""caliphate"" in eastern Syria collapsed last year.
On Tuesday evening the British, French, Jordanian, Saudi and U.S., foreign ministers met in Paris to see how to give extra support to De Mistura and consult on how to handle Russia's planned gathering in Sochi. 
""We want to put Geneva back at the center of the game and that's what we agreed,"" said a French diplomatic source.

""What the government bombings and the worrying developments of the Turkish action in the north show ... is that we are entering a danger zone. It’s our job to prevent this getting worse, be it on a military or humanitarian level.""

809,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>","In Davos, Gulf Arabs slam an absent Iran","By Yara Bayoumy
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Gulf Arab officials used the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday to slam Iran for what they said was its destabilizing behavior in the region, taking advantage of Tehran's conspicuous absence at the annual event.
Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had been a regular presence at the annual forum that brings together top politicians, CEOs and bankers and he often clashed with his Gulf Arab counterparts at competing sessions.
But this year, he did not show. 
As a result, the platform was wide open for Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to criticize Iran, as well as more measured criticism from others.
Iran, the leading Shi'ite Muslim power, and Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally, are rivals for influence in the Middle East where they support opposing sides in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon.
""In the Middle East, we have two competing visions. Vision of light ... and we have a vision of darkness, and the vision of darkness is sectarianism, it's trying to restore an empire that was destroyed thousands of years ago, it's using sectarianism and terrorism in order to interfere in the affairs of other countries,"" Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a panel at the forum.
""History has shown that light always prevails over darkness.""
Iran denies interference in Arab countries' affairs. Last year at Davos, Zarif said Iran and Saudi Arabia should be able to work together to help end conflicts in Syria and Yemen.
Saudi-led forces, which back the Yemeni government, have also fought the Iran-allied Houthis in Yemen's civil war. Saudi Arabia’s crown prince has described Iran’s supply of rockets to the Houthis as “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.
Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri gave a more measured critique. His coalition government, which includes the Iran-backed Hezbollah group, means that he has had to tread carefully. His Saudi allies accuse Hezbollah of waging war across the Middle East as agents of Iran.
Hariri’s shock resignation from Riyadh last year had thrust Lebanon to the forefront of the regional quarrel between Saudi Arabia and Iran. He later rescinded his decision.
""Iran is a country that we need to deal with ... As prime minister, I would like to have the best relationship with Iran, but I would like it state to state,"" Hariri said at a separate panel.
""Iran represents a challenge in the region maybe but dialogue also is a part of resolving these issues,"" Hariri said. ""Iran cannot meddle in Yemen.""
German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen, while acknowledging that Berlin had issues with Iran, used the moment to defend the 2015 Iran nuclear deal sealed with world powers, which U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to abandon.

""We have many worries about Iran, without any question and we see a lot of problems with Iran without any question. But we think that the Iran (nuclear) deal encapsulates the core problem and therefore we think we should stick to the deal as long as Iran sticks to the deal too,"" she said.

The OAS Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH), unveiled by the Central American nation's President Juan Orlando Hernandez in 2015, said that a recently passed budgetary law will prevent the prosecutor's office from investigating and charging dozens of possible suspects involved in a graft scheme. 
""We don't understand how it's possible a law has been passed that seeks to maintain impunity and handicap the battle against corruption,"" MACCIH's Peruvian spokesman, Juan Jimenez, said at a news conference. He added that the new legislation will affect ""current and future"" probes. 
Honduras has been roiled by deadly protests following a disputed Nov. 26 election, which the center-left opposition has accused Hernandez of stealing. The OAS comments reveal the many hurdles to overcome for the poor, graft-riddled country with one of the world's highest murder rates. 
MACCIH has been involved in helping the Honduran prosecutor's office investigate a 2011-2015 embezzlement scheme that diverted 1.3 billion lempiras ($55 million) destined for social funds, allegedly with the help of more than 60 lawmakers and high-ranking officials. 
Jimenez said allies of the president in Congress are among the suspects, adding that the new law would paralyze investigations for three years while the government's financial authorities trace the diverted funds. 
In response, the Congress said in a statement that Jimenez's comments were ""malicious,"" adding that the law sought to encourage transparency. 
The president's office did not immediately respond to MACCIH's comments.

Macedonia took that name when it declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, but Greece has disputed it since, saying it implies territorial claims to a Greek province of the same name as well as to Greece's history.
The name of the airport - Skopje Alexander the Great Airport - has particularly riled Greeks because Macedonia is also the name of the ancient Greek kingdom ruled by Alexander. Prime Minister Zoran Zaev did not say what its new name would be.
Greece insists the country be referred to internationally as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia until the row is resolved. That is the name under which it was admitted to the United Nations in 1993.
""To demonstrate, in practice, that we are committed to finding a solution, I am announcing that we will change the name of the airport and avenues,"" Zaev told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, in comments translated into Greek.
Zaev said the final solution ""should be accepted by both sides, and promote the interests of both.""
The two sides had agreed to intensify consultations which are already underway, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said.
""We don't want to just solve the issue of the name, but to put the relations of our two countries on solid foundations,"" he said.
The dispute has held up the country's prospects of joining the European Union and NATO.
Greeks are highly sensitive about the issue. Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in northern Greece on Sunday against any solution that would include the term ""Macedonia.""

""The majority of citizens in both countries want close relations and mutual cooperation. We want to be partners in the EU, and in NATO,"" Zaev said.

813,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 02:36PM ET</span>","On eve of Trump trip, EU leaders warn against nationalism","By Noah Barkin and Yara Bayoumy
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - European leaders warned at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday against a return to nationalism, with France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Angela Merkel calling for more global cooperation to harness the forces of globalization.
The speeches by Merkel, Macron and Italy's Paolo Gentiloni -- leaders of the continent's three biggest economies -- came one day before U.S. President Donald Trump arrives at the annual summit in the Swiss Alps to promote his America First policies.
Since taking power one year ago, Trump has pulled the United States out of international agreements on trade and climate, and threatened to torpedo a deal to curb Iran's nuclear program, unsettling partners who have looked to Washington to help shape global rules since World War Two.
Macron spoke for a full hour, receiving a standing ovation from the crowd of CEOs, bankers and top academics, after he called for a ""global compact"" to address the economic forces that have led to rising inequality and a surge in populism.
""We have a situation where people are being told, on social and financial issues, that the answer is to do less, to cut our taxes, there is no limit, it's a race to the bottom,"" Macron said, weeks after Trump pushed through a large cut in corporate taxes that is expected to lure investment to the United States.
""If we aren't able to agree a standard of international cooperation, we will never convince the middle class, the working class that globalization is good for them.""
LESSONS OF HISTORY
Merkel, in her return to the world stage after months of political limbo in Germany, evoked the two world wars and questioned whether the West had learned the lessons from those conflicts. 
""We are seeing nationalism, populism and in a lot of countries a polarized atmosphere,"" Merkel told the packed auditorium where Trump will speak on Friday.
""We believe that isolation won't help us. We believe we need to cooperate, that protectionism is not the answer,"" she said, asking: ""Have we really learned from history, or haven't we?""
Pressed on what his message to Trump would be, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said it was legitimate to defend one's own citizens, companies and economic, but ""there is a limit"".
After suffering a series of crises over the past decade -- from euro turmoil, to Ukraine, refugees and Brexit -- Europe is feeling confident again.
Its economy has rebounded and the election of pro-European centrist Macron in France has injected new momentum into efforts to reform the European Union.
""Europe has been a phenomenal story this year,"" Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff told the forum this week.
Macron, switching between English and French, took several tongue-in-cheek swipes at Trump, with whom he's formed an odd bond since the two engaged in a bone-crushing macho handshake in their first meeting back in May.
At the outset of his speech, the 40-year-old French president joked about heavy snowfall in Davos, saying it might lead some people to question whether global warming was really a problem.
""Fortunately you didn't invite anybody skeptical of global warming this year,"" Macron, glancing over at WEF founder Klaus Schwab, said to laughs.
Merkel, weakened by an inconclusive German election in September, appeared days after the Social Democrats (SPD) agreed to enter coalition talks with her conservatives.

""Europe must take its fate into its own hands,"" she said, echoing a message she sent after a contentious Group of Seven summit with Trump back in May.

CUCUTA, Colombia (Reuters) - Colombia on Wednesday evicted over 200 homeless Venezuelans who had been sleeping in a sports field in its border town of Cucuta, highlighting growing unease over an influx of migrants from the crisis-hit neighboring country.
The Venezuelans were removed at the crack of dawn from the field in a middle-class neighborhood, where they had been sleeping in makeshift tents or on cardboard boxes. A few insulted Venezuela's leftist President Nicolas Maduro as they boarded Colombian migration agency trucks, a Reuters reporter witnessed.
Most were deported to Venezuela because they did not have valid passports, although some vowed to cross back over when they got the chance. 
""We left with the dream of working and escaping Nicolas Maduro's dictatorship in Venezuela, but unfortunately they're sending us back,"" said Jesus Millan, 45, minutes after being expelled back into Venezuela. He had been working in a car wash in Colombia. 
The roughly 50 Venezuelans who did have passports would be moved on, driven by authorities some 1,480 km (920 miles) to the Ecuadorean border, Colombian authorities said.
Colombia, already home to the most Venezuelan migrants in South America, is particularly vulnerable to Venezuela's swelling crisis.
An earlier wave of those seeking to escape Venezuela's collapsing economy, sky-high inflation and food shortages saw engineers snapping up jobs in Colombia's then-burgeoning oil industry or working in multinational companies in capital Bogota. 
Now, however, a growing number of poor Venezuelans are cramming onto buses to make their way to Colombian border towns, from where they try to make money to continue their journey to wealthier countries in South America. 
The evictions in Cucuta came in the wake of a small anti-Venezuelan protest in the town on Sunday. Locals said their children could no longer play in parks or sports fields, and expressed fears that the migrants would turn to crime to make a living. 
""We're not discriminating against anyone, but they're creating problems in residential areas,"" said Oscar Gerardino, an official of Colombia's Norte de Santander (MC:SAN) provincial government. 
The number of Venezuelans living in Colombia jumped 62 percent in the last half of 2017 to more than 550,000, Colombia's migration authority said earlier this month.
The United Nations is willing to send more aid to Colombia to help the country cope with the arriving migrants, Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on a visit to the Andean country last week.

815,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 01:53PM ET</span>","Opposition withdraws, giving Egypt's Sisi clear run to presidency","CAIRO (Reuters) - Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's last main challenger for the presidency pulled out on Wednesday, saying any hope of a new start for Egypt had ended in a race that is all but certain to deliver the leader a second landslide.
Former military commander Sisi was elected in 2014, a year after he led the army to oust Islamist President Mohamed Mursi.
After rights lawyer Khaled Ali's withdrawal on Wednesday and the arrest of the only serious challenger, former military chief of staff Sami Anan the day before, the March 26-28 vote now faces the prospect of featuring only one candidate.
Ali announced he was withdrawing from the race just hours after Sisi launched his own bid. He said his supporters were being intimidated and the electoral process was corrupt.
""People's confidence in the possibility of transforming electoral gains into a chance for a new beginning, has unfortunately, in our view, for now ended,"" Ali said at a news conference in central Cairo.
""We announce our decision not to enter this race.""
Ali said there was ""stubbornness by the electoral commission and many violations"" in favor of Sisi.
The electoral commission has said it will ensure the vote is fair and transparent. Egypt's president's office and government press center have not commented on the election race. 
Other candidates have until Jan. 29 to register before a final list is announced on Feb. 20. A small crop of lesser-known challengers have announced their intention to run but it is far from certain they will garner the necessary nominations required under Egyptian law to actually run.
Egypt, one of the top recipients of U.S. foreign aid, was rocked by unrest that followed mass protests in 2011 which ousted Hosni Mubarak, one of four Arab leaders to be toppled by a series of uprisings across the region.
Supporters say Sisi has brought more security since 2013, although the country faces a stubborn Islamic State insurgency in the North Sinai region. Critics say his popularity has been damaged by austerity reforms and a crackdown on dissidents.
Ali's announcement came a day after Egyptian authorities detained the last challenger seen as a real threat to Sisi's re-election, ex-military chief of staff Lieutenant General Anan.
The army accused Anan of breaking the law by running for office without permission and his campaign was halted in its tracks.
""BRAZEN ATTACK""
Anan's son, Samir, said police had raided the family home late on Tuesday. ""They took everything they found in his office ... they stayed until about 1 a.m.,"" he said.
The United Nations said it was concerned about reports of Anan's arrest. ""We urge the authorities in Egypt to ensure that the election campaign is conducted in a credible, inclusive, peaceful and participatory manner,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York.
Amnesty International said on Wednesday this was a ""brazen attack"" on freedom of expression and political participation.
""Anan is among a growing number of candidates arrested or convicted on trumped up charges by the Egyptian authorities,"" the London-based rights group said in a statement.
Egypt was ""hell-bent"" on arresting and harassing anyone who stood against Sisi, Amnesty said.
Candidates challenging Sisi have described sweeping efforts to kill off their campaigns before they begin, with media attacks, intimidation of supporters, and a nomination process stacked in favor of the former general.
When he announced last week he intended to run, he listed Egypt's achievements in his first term and said: ""Building the state takes 16 to 20 years, I am trying to finish it in eight years, God willing.""
Sisi has vowed to crush Islamist militants and revive a battered economy. Tough fiscal reforms introduced over the past year, in line with a $12 billion International Monetary Fund loan, hit Egyptians hard but has attracted new foreign investors and economists expect growth to pick up.
The Islamic State insurgency in North Sinai has expanded to include civilian targets in the past year. Egypt this month renewed its state of emergency for three more months, broadening the power of authorities to crack down on what it calls enemies of the state.
Sisi addressed police officers on the eve of annual Police Day, which is also the date that Egypt's 2011 uprising began.

""Stick to the goal ... we are talking about construction and development. No one (should) make us go astray,"" he said.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Scores convicted in Congo's Beni massacre trial,"By Fiston Mahamba
GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - A military tribunal investigating a wave of massacres in eastern Congo blamed on Ugandan rebels has convicted 134 people, a senior army prosecutor and a human rights group said on Wednesday.
More than 800 people were killed -- often hacked to death with machetes during the night -- around the town of Beni, near Democratic Republic of Congo's border with Uganda, between 2014 and 2016. 
Congolese authorities say the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group active in the area, were behind the killings, but Congolese army officers have also been accused of involvement.
Rebel and militia attacks are on the rise again in central and eastern Congo and the latest violence coincides with a political crisis brought on by President Joseph Kabila's decision to overstay his mandate, which expired in December 2016. 
Congolese troops are currently battling the ADF in the eastern border zones in coordination with the Ugandan military.
General Timothee Mukutu, the Congolese army's First Advocate-General, said a portion of the earlier massacres were committed by ADF fighters during supply raids or in reprisal attacks.
""Others were carried out by proxy on the orders of certain local figures,"" he said in an interview broadcast by U.N.-supported Radio Okapi. ""We came to understand that there were poorly managed land conflicts that could be an explanation."" 
CEPADHO, a human rights group that observed the trials, said that of those convicted - a mix of ADF rebels, militia fighters, civilians and local chiefs - 42 were sentenced to death, several of them in absentia. 
Congo does not apply the death penalty and, in practice, those who receive it serve prison sentences instead. Other defendants received lighter sentences and 45 were acquitted.
ARMY INVOLVEMENT?
A report by New York University's Congo Research Group published last year found that senior army officers, including the former top general in the zone, supported and in some cases organized the killings.
Based on 249 interviews with perpetrators, witnesses and victims as well as internal U.N. reports and arrest records, it found they collaborated with local fighters and, in some cases, soldiers secured the perimeter so that victims could not escape. 
However, during the 17 months of trials, the mobile military tribunal, only convicted one army officer, a colonel. He was sentenced to a four-year jail term.
Three men were convicted of ""demoralizing the army in the aim of harming national defense"" for publicly accusing government and military authorities of organizing the massacres.

The Federal Trade Commission and Food and Drug Administration said they had posted warning letters to 11 companies that market or distribute the treatments.
""Health fraud scams like these can pose serious health risks. These products have not been demonstrated to be safe or effective and may keep some patients from seeking appropriate, FDA-approved therapies,"" the FTC said in its release. 
Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, played a role in 42,249 U.S. deaths in 2016, up 28 percent from 2015 and 47 percent from 2014, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The opioid crisis has lowered overall life expectancy in Americans.
Frank King, founder of King Bio which received a letter, said that it had stopped selling the medicine that the FTC and FDA objected to in order to avoid litigation.
""We choose to not fight it but to just go ahead and pull that particular product just because it was not a battle worth well over six figures to fight,"" said King.
The other 10 companies and products named were Opiate Freedom Center (Opiate Freedom 5-Pack); U4Life, LLC (Mitadone); CalmSupport, LLC (CalmSupport); TaperAid (TaperAid & TaperAid Complete); Medicus Holistic Alternatives, LLC (Natracet); NutraCore Health Products, LLC (Opiate Detox Pro); Healthy Healing, LLC (Withdrawal Support); Soothedrawal, Inc (Soothedrawal); Choice Detox Center, Inc (Nofeel) and GUNA, Inc (GUNA-ADDICT 1).

Reuters sought comment from the 11 companies but only King Bio responded. The websites for several appeared to be offline and no contact information was available. Others could be reached but did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Cameron, who called the June 2016 referendum after being returned to power the year before, campaigned for Britons to stay in the EU, arguing that leaving the bloc would send the country into an economic tailspin.
However, despite his dire warnings, Britons shocked the political establishment by voting 52 to 48 percent for Brexit, prompting Cameron to announce he would step down.
""As I keep saying, it's a mistake not a disaster. It's turned out less badly than we first thought,"" Cameron was caught saying to Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
""But it's ... still going to be difficult,"" he said in footage captured by Britain's Channel 5 News.
Britain's economy has withstood the Brexit vote shock better than most private economists expected at the time of the vote but it has lagged behind growth rates seen in most other leading economies.
Theresa May, who replaced Cameron as prime minister and vowed that Britain will exit the bloc in March 2019, has faced widespread criticism for her leadership on the issue.
The country remains deeply polarized about Brexit and research indicates there is growing concern amongst Britons about how the divorce talks are proceeding and pessimism about the economic impact of leaving. [nL8N1P43QF]

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States announced new sanctions aimed at stopping North Korea's nuclear weapons development on Wednesday and urged China and Russia to expel North Koreans raising funds for the programs.
The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on nine entities, 16 people and six North Korean ships it accused of helping the weapons programs. It said two China-based trading firms were involved in exporting millions of dollars worth of metals and other goods used in weapons production.
The individuals included members of North Korea's Workers Party operating in China, Russia and Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region. Among them were North Korea's vice consul in Nakhodka, Russia and an individual reportedly involved in sending North Korean laborers to Abkhazia.
“Treasury continues to systematically target individuals and entities financing the Kim regime and its weapons programs, including officials complicit in North Korean sanctions evasion schemes,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
""The U.S. government is targeting illicit actors in China, Russia, and elsewhere who are working on behalf of North Korean financial networks, and calling for their expulsion from the territories where they reside."" 
The entities sanctioned included North Korea's Ministry of Crude Oil Industry.
The action enables the United States to block assets held by the individuals or firms in the United States and prohibits U.S. citizens from dealing with them.
The United States has led an international campaign to tighten sanctions on North Korea to force it to give up development of nuclear weapons and missiles capable of hitting the United States.
The U.N. Security Council in December unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea for a recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to further limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil.
CIA director Mike Pompeo has said North Korea is ""a handful of months"" away from being able to make a nuclear attack on the United States.
On Tuesday, he said U.S. President Donald Trump's focus was on a diplomatic solution to the crisis backed by tighter sanctions, but the CIA was working to provide a range of other options should that fail.
The Trump administration has said all options are on the table including military ones, and officials say the president and his advisers have discussed the possibility of a limited strike. But debate on military options has lost some momentum in recent weeks after North and South Korea resumed talks ahead of next month's Winter Olympics in the South.
Sanctions expert Anthony Ruggiero of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank said the Treasury move showed Trump’s ""maximum pressure"" policy would continue even with the focus on the inter-Korea talks. 
""The action against Chinese firms is important as it increases the pressure on Beijing to stop Chinese nationals from facilitating North Korea’s sanctions evasion,"" he said.
Treasury named the firms as Beijing Chengxing Trading Co. Ltd. and Dandong Jinxiang Trade Co., Ltd. 
A senior U.S. official said this week that despite the Trump administration’s recent public focus on Russia, China remained the main culprit in North Korea sanctions busting. He pointed to involvement of Chinese organized crime groups, banks, and government officials in the peddling of amphetamines, counterfeit currency and fake luxury goods.
While China has backed successive rounds of U.N. sanctions on North Korea it worries that excessive pressure could cause the collapse of a country it has long considered a strategic ally.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 12:36PM ET</span>",Men-only gala where hostesses were groped faces backlash in Britain,"By Estelle Shirbon
LONDON (Reuters) - The London charity behind a men-only fundraising gala where specially hired hostesses were groped and harassed, according to a Financial Times report, faced a swift backlash on Wednesday with donations being returned and politicians denouncing it.
The FT article by a reporter who went undercover at the Presidents Club gala last week described braying men in tuxedos fondling women, putting their hands up their skirts, pulling them into their laps, making lewd comments and offering to take them to hotel rooms.
One of the 130 hostesses, who were required to wear skimpy black dresses with matching underwear and to sign non-disclosure agreements before entertaining the 360 male guests, said a diner had exposed his penis to her during the event.
""Women were bought as bait for men, for rich men, not a mile from where we stand, as if that is acceptable behaviour. It is totally unacceptable,"" lawmaker Jess Phillips told parliament during a hastily convened debate about the issue.
She was one of several visibly furious women politicians who lined up to denounce the event as despicable.
Two London children's hospitals, Great Ormond Street and Evelina, said they would return donations received from the Presidents Club, while corporate sponsor WPP (LON:WPP), the advertising group, said it was severing ties with the organisation.
""We would never knowingly accept donations raised in this way,"" Great Ormond Street said in a statement.
By the end of the day, the previously little known Presidents Club announced it would shut itself down.
""The trustees have decided that the Presidents Club will not host any further fundraising events. Remaining funds will be distributed in an efficient manner to children’s charities and it will then be closed,"" the charity said in a statement.
The FT said the event, an annual fixture on the London social calendar for three decades, was attended by business executives, financiers, politicians and other powerful men.
Coming at a time of intense public debate about sexual harassment in the workplace, the report conjured up an image of sections of the British establishment that many found shocking and badly out of touch with modern values.
""I thought that things had changed. However, it is absolutely clear that things have not changed,"" Anne Milton, junior education minister, told parliament.
""I think that there is an association between wealthy people and this sort of behaviour, and we have to send a clear message that it is unacceptable.""
The Bank of England, which was dragged into the story because one of the prizes offered up for auction at the event was tea with Governor Mark Carney, said it had not approved the prize or had any contact with the organisers.
""The Governor is deeply dismayed that such an event could take place,"" the Bank said in a statement.
Also on offer for big donors was lunch with Boris Johnson, Britain's foreign secretary. The Foreign Office declined immediate comment. Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said Johnson had not known about the prize.
""YOU LOOK FAR TOO SOBER""
Luxury goods businessman David Meller, one of co-chairmen of the Presidents Club Charitable Trust, stepped down as a non-executive board member at the education ministry as the fallout from the FT report intensified.
May's spokesman said she had been uncomfortable reading about the event, pointedly saying that as a woman she would not have been invited.
One of the people who did attend was Conservative member of parliament Nadhim Zahawi, who is also a junior minister in the education department. Milton told parliament Zahawi had not stayed long, prompting jeers from opposition lawmakers.
Zahawi said on Twitter the behaviour described in the FT report was truly shocking and he condemned it. ""I will never attend a men-only function ever,"" he added.
The FT report said lots put up for auction at the gala, which was held at the prestigious Dorchester Hotel, included a night at a strip club and a course of plastic surgery, with the invitation ""Add spice to your wife"".
At an after-party, held in a smaller room off the main lobby of the Dorchester, a man described as a prominent society figure had grabbed a hostess by the waist and pulled her in against his stomach.
""You look far too sober,"" the man was reported as saying. ""I want you to down that glass, rip off your knickers and dance on that table.""
The FT said the Presidents Club trust had two joint chairmen, London property developer Bruce Ritchie and Meller, who also runs a chain of schools.
Reuters contacted Ritchie's Residential Land company, Meller's luxury goods firm Meller Designs and his educational trust to seek comment. No one was made available to speak about it.
The Dorchester Hotel said it was deeply concerned over allegations. ""We are in discussions with the organisers and an investigation is underway.""
The Charity Commission, the not-for-profit sector regulator, said it would be urgently investigating the Presidents Club.

The cache found in eastern Iran consisted of 23 remote controlled bombs which were alleged to have been brought across the eastern border with the help of ""Saudi intelligence services"", a statement, quoted by state media, said.
There was no immediate reaction from Riyadh. 
Last June, Islamic State carried out attacks at the Iranian parliament in Tehran and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, south of the capital, which killed at least 18 people.
Iran blamed Saudi Arabia for the attacks, a charge Riyadh denied. 
The second cache was found in the town of Marivan in the Kurdish region of western Iran. The cache consisted of TNT, explosives kits, electronic detonators, grenades, ammunition clips for AK-47 machine guns and four rocket propelled grenades, the statement said. 
A ""terrorist group"" brought the material from the Kurdish region of Iraq across the border into Iran, the intelligence ministry statement said, without elaborating.

ANKARA/BEIRUT (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday Turkey would extend its military operation in Syria to the town of Manbij, a move that could potentially bring Turkish forces into confrontation with those of their NATO ally the United States.
Turkey's air and ground ""Operation Olive Branch"" in the Afrin region of northern Syria is now in its fifth day, targeting Kurdish YPG fighters and opening a new front in Syria's multi-sided civil war.
A push toward Manbij, in a separate Kurdish-held enclave some 100 km (60 miles) east of Afrin, could threaten U.S. plans to stabilize a swath of northeast Syria.
The United States has around 2,000 special forces troops in Syria, officially as part of an international U.S.-led coalition, assisting the Kurds in battle against Islamic State.
None of the Americans are known to be based in the Afrin area, but they are deployed in the Kurdish-held pocket that includes Manbij. Washington has angered Turkey by providing arms, training and air support to the Syrian Kurdish forces, which Turkey considers enemies.
""With the Olive Branch operation, we have once again thwarted the game of those sneaky forces whose interests in the region are different,"" Erdogan said in a speech to provincial leaders in Ankara.
""Starting in Manbij, we will continue to thwart their game.""
Differences over Syria policy have already strained Turkey's relations with Washington almost to a breaking point. For the United States, the YPG is a key ally against both Islamic State jihadists and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces.
A Turkish operation in Manbij would be fraught with risk due to the presence of the U.S. military personnel in and around the town. They were deployed there last March to deter Turkish and U.S.-backed rebels from attacking each other and have also carried out training missions in Manbij.
President Donald Trump plans to raise the U.S. concerns over the Turkish offensive in a telephone call with Erdogan expected on Wednesday, a senior U.S. official said.
In an interview with Reuters, Turkey's government spokesman said he saw a small possibility that Turkish forces could come face-to-face with the U.S. troops in Manbij.
MOUNTING DEATH TOLL
U.S.-backed Syrian fighters in the Manbij area have deployed to frontlines to confront any Turkish assault and are in contact with the U.S.-led coalition over defending the town, their spokesman Sharfan Darwish said on Wednesday.
""We are in full readiness to respond to any attack.""
Rockets fired from Afrin struck the Turkish border town of Kilis, wounding 13 people in the area, the local governor said, the latest in what have been a series of such attacks since the start of the operation. 
Dozens of combatants have been killed since Turkey launched the offensive, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war.
Turkish shelling and airstrikes in Afrin have killed 28 civilians, while two civilians were killed as a result of YPG shelling near Azaz, a town held by Turkish-backed opponents of President Bashar al-Assad, the monitoring group said.
Turkey said three of its soldiers had been killed. Observatory head Rami Abdulrahman said 48 Turkey-backed Syrian fighters with Free Syrian Army groups had been killed and that the death toll among the Kurdish YPG so far stood at 42.
The Turkish military said it had killed at least 287 Kurdish fighters and Islamic State militants in the offensive. The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) umbrella group led by the Kurdish YPG said there was no Islamic State presence in Afrin and Turkey had exaggerated the number of dead.
SECURITY LINE
Communication between the United States and Turkey has continued over Syria, despite the countries' differences.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said he spoke to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who, he said, had suggested the formation of a ""30 km security line"" inside Syria, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported.
Turkey has previously sought such buffer zones in parts of Syria near its southern border.
A senior U.S. official said that as of Tuesday the Turks had not been ready to engage in detail on such a proposal. 
Bad weather, including heavy rain, has hampered Turkey's offensive. Heavy clouds have hindered air support, limiting advances, and Kurdish militia have retaken some territory.
Turkish troops and allied Syrian fighters have been trying to take the summit of Bursaya Hill, overlooking the eastern approach to Afrin town.
""Turkey has not been able yet to shore up its control over any of the villages it has advanced on,"" said the Observatory's Abdulrahman. He attributed this to fierce resistance from YPG fighters who are from Afrin, and the hilly terrain of the area.
Afrin is separated from Manbij and the rest of the territory held by the Kurdish-led forces by a strip of land held by Assad's government forces.
In 2016, the Kurdish-led SDF pushed Islamic State fighters out of Manbij. Erdogan has accused the United States of reneging on a promise to ensure that Kurdish fighters would return the town to Arab control.
U.S., British and German volunteers who fought against Islamic State alongside Kurdish-led forces in Syria are also now in the Afrin area to help confront Turkey, the SDF said.
U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis has said Turkey's offensive is distracting from efforts to defeat Islamic State.

The United States has hoped to use the YPG's control of territory to give it the diplomatic muscle it needs to revive U.N.-led talks in Geneva on a deal that would end Syria's civil war and eventually lead to Assad's removal.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - National courts should be able to expel foreign criminals more easily, Denmark's prime minister on Wednesday told a European rights body that his country currently chairs.
Denmark's Supreme Court last year ruled that four Romanians accused in their home country of human trafficking could not be expelled because the conditions in Romania's prisons would violate their human rights.
""It is simply not fair, that countries like Denmark end up housing foreign criminals, because of the poor prison conditions in their home countries,"" Lars Lokke Rasmussen told the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.
The Council is a 47-nation human rights body that has no legislative powers.
""We need a system that is tougher on countries that do not fulfill their human rights obligations,"" Rasmussen said.
""At the same time we need a system that does not interfere too much in countries who take human rights seriously.""
Rasmussen's said that Denmark will in April host a ministerial conference under the aegis of the Council, aimed at giving ""new impetus to the ongoing reform of the (human rights) Convention system"".
Proposals would include greater leeway to expel foreign criminals, but chances of the Council approving such a motion appear slim as some delegates have argued it would undermine the legitimacy of the European Court of Human Rights.
Danish governments, regardless of political persuasion, have traditionally defended and endorsed European human rights conventions.
The three-party minority coalition that Rasmussen heads relies on the anti-immigration People's Party to pass legislation.

The Yemeni nationals were sent to Ghana in January 2016 for an initial two-year period after spending more than a decade at the U.S.-operated Guantanamo Bay prison for suspected terrorism.
The opposition is concerned that now the two years has expired, the United States no longer has shared responsibility for making sure the suspects pose no danger and has been pressing the government to deport them.
Their arrival in Ghana has long been disputed. President Nana Akufo-Addo, who was the main opposition leader at the time of the transfer, criticized the government for accepting the two Yemenis at the time. 
Now his government is coming under pressure itself.
""The government is constrained from immediately deporting them except to explore mutually acceptable means with other countries and the refugees,"" Foreign Minister Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey told Reuters. ""If we don't get them to consent we cannot send them packing.""
Mahmud Umar Muhammad Bin Atef and Khalid Muhammad Salih al-Dhuby have lived in the capital, Accra, since they arrived. Neither man was tried or convicted at Guantanamo, nor have they been accused of any crime since arriving in Ghana.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators called on the U.S. Department of Justice on Wednesday to investigate allegations of drug trafficking by senior officials in the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, as the country struggles with economic crisis.
In a letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions seen by Reuters, Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democrat Robert Menendez said they were concerned about possible connections between Maduro's government and drug trafficking organizations and wanted an investigation ""in order to better understand the nexus between criminal actors and members of Maduro's inner circle.""
Despite being a major oil producing country, Venezuela is undergoing a severe economic and social crisis, with millions suffering food and medicine shortages, hyperinflation and growing insecurity.
Rubio is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's western hemisphere subcommittee, and Menendez is its ranking Democrat. Both lawmakers are vocal critics of the Venezuelan government.
In their letter, they raised concerns that the situation in Venezuela could destabilize the region.
The Venezuelan Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the past, Maduro has dismissed accusations about drug trafficking links as a smear campaign by Washington, adding that the United States is to blame for the drug trade because it is such a large market for illegal narcotics.
On Aug. 1, 2016, a U.S. District Court announced the indictment of Nestor Reverol, who is now Venezuela's interior minister, on charges of participating in an international cocaine trafficking conspiracy. In February 2017, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions against Venezuelan Vice President Tareck el-Aissami for drug trafficking and other related crimes.
And in December 2017, two nephews of Maduro's wife, Franqui Francisco Flores de Freitas and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores, were convicted in U.S. federal court for drug smuggling.
The European Union announced new sanctions on several senior Venezuelan officials, including Reverol, on Monday, saying this was an expression of the bloc's concern with the political crisis under Maduro.
Rubio and Menendez also asked Sessions to support efforts by the Organization of American States to address human rights concerns in Venezuela.
A Justice Department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter, which was sent on Wednesday.

826,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 11:28AM ET</span>",Ex-USA Gymnastics doctor to be sentenced after week of emotional testimony,"By Steve Friess
LANSING, Mich. (Reuters) - A Michigan judge on Wednesday heard from three more victims of former long-time USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar ahead of imposing a sentence on the disgraced physician for molesting young female gymnasts.
Prosecutors have asked for a sentence of 40 to 125 years for Nassar, who is already serving a 60-year sentence in federal prison on child pornography convictions.
More than 160 of Nassar's victims - including Olympic gold medalists - have spoken at his sentencing hearing in Ingham County Circuit Court in Lansing since it began on Jan. 16. 
The last victim to testify on Wednesday, Rachael Denhollander, was the first to come forward publicly with allegations against Nassar. She reported him to Michigan State University police in 2016 and told her story to the Indianapolis Star.
She testified that Nassar began abusing her in 2000 when she was a 15-year-old gymnast.
""As we were being sexually violated, Larry was sexually aroused by our humiliation,"" Denhollander said.
Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, who has expressed support for the victims, told Denhollander she had ""started the tidal wave.""
""You are the bravest person I have ever had in my courtroom,"" the judge said.
Nassar pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of first-degree sex assault in Ingham County and previously apologized in court for his crimes. As part of a deal with Michigan authorities, he also pleaded guilty to three additional counts in Eaton County and will be sentenced there next week.
MICHIGAN STATE CONNECTION
While Denhollander was one of the seven girls Nassar admitted abusing in Ingham County, Aquilina has allowed other victims to speak at his sentencing, resulting in emotional and scalding admonishments of Nassar. He has sat, wearing a dark blue jail jumpsuit, through much of the proceedings with his head bowed. He seldom has made eye contact with the victims but looked directly at Denhollander during much of her statement.
Nassar, 54, served as the USA Gymnastics physician through four Olympic Games. He also was the team physician for the Michigan State University gymnastics and women's crew teams, as well as an associate professor at MSU's College of Osteopathic Medicine.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association said on Tuesday it had opened an investigation into Michigan State's handling of the case. In her statement on Wednesday, Denhollander criticized the school for failing to adequately investigate complaints against Nassar stretching back years.
Olympic gold medalists Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney have gone public in recent months, saying they were assaulted by Nassar while undergoing treatment.
Victims and others have criticized USA Gymnastics for ignoring their complaints and have accused the federation of suppressing their accounts in a bid to avoid bad publicity. 
On Monday, three top board members resigned in wake of the scandal and continued criticism, following the exit last March of the federation's president and chief executive.
The fallout also has included several companies announcing they would not continue to sponsor the federation, including AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) on Tuesday, according to media reports.

Many victims also have criticized USA Gymnastics, with Raisman last week calling it ""rotten from the inside."" She also called for an independent investigation of the federation and U.S. Olympic officials, who she said had the power to stop Nassar.

827,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 11:22AM ET</span>","Italy's homeless, jobless migrants shunned by politicians","By Steve Scherer
TURIN, Italy (Reuters) - A rainstorm buffets unheated apartment blocks on the outskirts of the northern Italian city of Turin where more than 1,000 impoverished African migrants huddle in rooms built to house 300 competitors at the 2006 Winter Olympics.
The plight of the hundreds of thousands of migrants struggling to build a life in Italy is rarely discussed by most political parties, even though immigration is one of the hottest issues ahead of national elections on March 4. 
Keen to harness a growing backlash against more than 600,000 migrants who have landed on Italian shores in the past four years, the parties are instead promising tough measures such as mass deportations or halting immigration altogether.
With poor Italians also struggling to find housing and jobs in an anemic economy, offering support to migrants such as those in the Olympic village is not considered a vote winner.
The residents of one of Europe's largest squats, some sleeping in stairwells and storage closets, hail from 28 African countries. Many are jobless or earn very little with sporadic work. Years after first landing in Italy, some cannot afford food, let alone rent.
""This place is the epitome of Italy's failure to integrate,"" said Nicolo' Vasile, a 31-year-old engineer from Sicily who spends an average of 40 hours a week helping residents, including 40 families and 50 children, with maintenance, paperwork and other tasks.
""There is no institutional path to integration. It simply doesn't exist, unlike elsewhere in Europe,"" said Vasile, one of 20 local volunteers, from students to pensioners to professors, who help those stuck in the Turin complex.
The ruling center-left Democratic Party (PD) tried to take the sting out of the migration debate last year by striking deals with the Tripoli government and coast guard aimed at preventing migrants from boarding boats for Europe.
As a result, the number of migrants arriving in Italy by sea fell by a third last year to 119,000, but this has failed to quell the fears of ordinary Italians.
In May 2013, only 4 percent of Italians saw immigration as one of the two most important issues affecting their country. By May of last year the figure was 36 percent, according to the European Commission's Eurobarometer survey.
Thirty percent of the electorate would vote for a party that pledges to put ""Italians first"", while 25 percent would back a bloc promising to ""stop immigrants"", according to an SWG poll published last week.
MASS DEPORTATIONS
The opposition center-right bloc is taking the hardest line against migrants.
The coalition, which includes Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) and the anti-immigrant Northern League, is leading in the opinion polls though no single bloc appears yet to have enough votes to govern alone.
Former prime minister Berlusconi says irregular migrants are driving up crime and should be deported, even though official data shows crime rates fell last year. The far-right Northern League has promised mass deportations.
""There are half a million irregular migrants in Italy. All of them need to be sent home,"" League leader Matteo Salvini told la Repubblica newspaper on Tuesday.
The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which is polling as the single biggest party at just under 30 percent, says Italians must come first and that it will deport irregular migrants.
One of the reasons offering aid to immigrants is unpopular is that some Italians face similar problems with housing and jobs, and likewise receive little or no help from the government.
Greece, another country on the immigration frontline, offers even less than Italy, but those who reach European Union countries such as Germany and Sweden get more support because refugee status gives them access to robust welfare systems.
While Italy's migrant budget was 4.3 billion euros ($5.3 billion) last year, Germany's federal government spent 13.6 billion euros to accommodate and process asylum seekers, two years after more than a million refugees crossed its borders.
Germany's 16 state governments spent billions more. In 2016, the states spent about 23 billion euros though exact figures for last year are not yet available.
IN LIMBO
In Italy, almost 200,000 migrants now live in shelters, but they must leave when their asylum request is granted, which usually takes no more than 18 months, with no further housing or unemployment benefits provided. Almost 120,000 people have received some form of asylum in Italy in the past four years. 
Required by law to seek asylum and work in the European Union country where they first set foot, the migrants are trapped in Italy, forcing many to forage to survive.
Jamal Adam, 31, from the Darfur region of Sudan arrived in Italy in 2011. Unable to find a job he went to Germany, but returned because the EU asylum rules prevented him from getting legal papers in any country other than Italy.
""In Germany, they give you money and a place to stay and you rest easy,"" he said in the Olympic village in Turin as daily prayers from Mecca echoed out of a TV. ""Here you get nothing.""
He has been squatting in a small room with three others since the four buildings were first occupied in early 2013. 
Like more than 90 percent of those in the Turin complex, Adam can stay and work legally in Italy, but remains unemployed.
""It's not normal for people to live like this,"" said Sonia Schellino, the social affairs assessor for the Turin City Council, run by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. 
She is working with various local bodies to try to empty the buildings, offering migrants better lodging, guaranteed for six months to a year, plus jobs or training. Migrants, though, fear they will be back on the streets afterwards.
Trapped in limbo with their dreams of a better future fading, some residents are depressed and mentally fragile. ""They just lose it after a while,"" volunteer Vasile says. One migrant attempted suicide by leaping from a window this month.
Samuel Pieta from Cameroon lives on the top floor of one block. He is 33, has been in Italy since 2011 but has never worked in the country. His room is decorated with soccer balls, books, broken fax machines and a refrigerator he uses as a wardrobe, all objects he found in local trash bins.
When asked how he survives, he holds up a box of half-smoked cigarettes he has collected on his daily rounds.

""This is how I survive. I get what I need from the garbage. I eat what others throw away,"" he says, clutching his head between his hands, tears in his eyes.

828,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>","Turkey is an aggressive neighbor, Greek PM tells Europeans in Davos","DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said on Wednesday his European partners couldn't always appreciate the challenges of living with an 'aggressive' neighbor such as Turkey, remarks reflecting the strained ties between the two NATO partners. 
Tsipras was speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in a discussion about stabilizing the Mediterranean and addressing the migration crisis.
Hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants crossed from Turkey into Greece and further into the European Union at the height of the migration crisis in 2015. It coincided with Greece negotiating its third financial bailout from international creditors to stave off bankruptcy.
Tsipras, who came to power in early 2015, said he took the helm at a very difficult time for Greece which didn't only have to grapple with its worst debt crisis and the refugee crisis, but also an ""aggressive neighbor, sometimes unpredictable with an aggressive military activity in the Aegean,"" Tsipras said. 
NATO partners Greece and Turkey have a long history of differences that have outlived the Cold War, ranging from jousting over airspace in the Aegean Sea to minority rights and the ethnically split island of Cyprus. 
The two now cooperate in a deal brokered between Ankara and the European Union in March 2016 aimed at slowing migrant flows. Tsipras described the deal, which has been criticized by human rights groups, as 'a difficult but necessary agreement'.
Tsipras said that implementing the agreement, making sure that international laws were not being violated as Greece has been processing thousands of asylum requests, and ensuring that national interests were also safeguarded, was important.
""At the same time we have to take a decision on what we are going to do with this aggressive behavior of Turkey,"" he said in response to an observation that Turkey could change its mind on the migration deal at any time.

""For somebody (sic), it is very easy to be also aggressive if they are living in Luxembourg or Netherlands, because their neighbors are Belgium and Luxembourg, and not Turkey. But it's not so easy for us.""

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's ruling People's Party (PP) funded a 2007 regional election campaign with kickbacks from businessmen in exchange for work contracts, a former senior party official told a court on Wednesday as part of a corruption trial.
The PP has denied any wrongdoing and said it had not received any illegal payment.
The trial at the Spanish High Court follows several long-running graft investigations into allegations that the conservative People's Party (PP) used a slush fund to illegally finance campaigns, which the party denies.
The case has tainted the 6-year-long administration of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, the PP's leader since 2004, restricting his minority government's ability to negotiate legislation with other parties and fuelling calls for him to resign.
Rajoy became the first sitting Spanish prime minister to give evidence in a trial when he appeared as a witness last July. He denied ever taking illicit payments and said the allegations were ""absolutely false"".
Ricardo Costa, the deputy PP head for the Valencia region from 2007 to 2009, said he was aware the party's regional leadership accepted payments from local businessmen, who would deposit cash in accounts at different Valencian bank branches.
The payment amounts were below 3,000 euros ($3,700) to skirt the threshold imposed by the law that governed party financing. Several of these businessmen testified last week that they had financed Valencian election campaigns in 2007 and 2008.
""Yes, it's true that the PP financed itself with dirty money in the 2007 election campaign events,"" Costa said during a televised court appearance. The PP won that year's regional election.
Costa, who prosecutors have asked the court to jail for 7 years and 9 months, said he did not do anything when he found out about the practice and ""of course assumed the responsibility that that entails"".
On Wednesday, Rajoy denied the PP's Valencian wing received illegal payments.
""I didn't know anything about that ... I will wait and see what the courts say,"" he told Onda Cero radio.

The case originally centered on illegal dealings between small city councils and a network of businesses. But it expanded to snare several former high-ranking PP members such as ex-party treasurer, Luis Barcenas, who is among the 37 people on trial on charges of organized crime, falsifying accounts, influence-peddling and tax crimes.

""Mr. Wagner resigned on January 11 from the state board on his own volition. Only afterwards was it known that he had converted to Islam,"" Friese told Reuters.

Delegates to an SPD special congress voted narrowly at the weekend to work towards a repeat of the ""grand coalition"" that has ruled Germany for the past four years, siding with party leadership against the SPD's more radical ""Jusos"" youth wing.
But party leader Martin Schulz, desperate to win over a skeptical rank-and-file, pledged to consult the party's 450,000-odd members in a postal ballot before inking a final deal that would end months of uncertainty in Europe's largest economy.
""Join this party! Make it yours,"" said Kevin Kuehnert, head of the Jusos in a speech to Sunday's congress urging against the vote, echoing his group's more prosaic slogan: ""A tenner against the GroKo"" - the shorthand term for a grand coalition.
Regional party organizations have reported a boost in membership applications, costing from 5 euros a month, since the weekend as people race to join the postal ballot when a deal is reached. 
In North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany's largest state, the SPD had received 600 new applications, in Berlin, 300.
These numbers are still small compared with the 30,000 who streamed into the party over 2017 amid the short-lived euphoria that followed Schulz's appointment as leader, many of whom can be expected to maintain their backing for him.
Many in the Jusos liken themselves to ""Momentum"", a left-wing dissident membership group that has influence in Britain's Labour Party, securing the election of outsider Jeremy Corbyn as leader over the objections of the then-leadership.
But party leaders warned against a short-term influx of new members joining with just one purpose in mind. Officials told newspaper Die Welt that they planned to introduce a cut-off date that would ensure new members were committed in the long term before being given full voting rights.
""The SPD isn't eBay,"" Michael Groschek, the SPD's chief in NRW, told newspaper Die Welt. ""We don't put our political decisions up for auction.""

Turkey has accepted some 3.5 million refugees from Syria with the southern city of Gaziantep - near front lines along Syria's northern border - hosting 500,000 alone, or a quarter of its population. 
After over a million refugees flowed through Turkey to the EU in 2015, the bloc agreed to pay Ankara in exchange it preventing further refugees from trying to cross the Mediterranean to Greece and travel onwards to wealthy western Europe. That deal reduced the human flow to a trickle.
The EU says it has allocated all of the 3 billion euros ($3.7 bln) it had promised Turkey for 2016-17, though less than 2 billion of that had so far been disbursed due to procedural issues, which Ankara sees as petty.
""We expect the EU to keep its promises in the fastest way possible,"" Fatma Sahin, Gaziantep's mayor and a prominent member of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party, told Reuters on a visit to EU headquarters in Brussels.
""They have to walk the talk.""
Sahin, who was to meet top EU migration and humanitarian officials in Brussels, wants the bloc to pitch in more as Gaziantep has been shifting from giving refugees basic food and shelter to offering them schooling, health services and jobs.
Since the migration deal in early 2016, EU-Turkish ties have soured over what the bloc sees as Erdogan's authoritarianism and harsh treatment of critics and dissenters, especially since a botched coup attempt in July 2016. 
Despite Turkey being an important NATO ally, the EU has all but frozen Turkey's accession bid - long stalled in any case - in reaction to sweeping dismissals and arrests of the military, judges, scientists and journalists following the failed coup.
While Erdogan wants all Syrian refugees to return home eventually, Sahin - as mayor of a city near Syria's front line - knows that will not happen anytime soon. 
""We made an agreement with the EU. Turkey is fulfilling its conditions entirely,"" she said, adding that the first, 3-billion-euro tranche of aid should come through swiftly.
""There is no certainty about the second lot at the moment and we want everything to happen as promised and in the fastest way possible,"" she said of another 3 billion euros the bloc has tentatively promised but, as relations with Turkey have deteriorated, is now debating whether and how to follow through.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The former leader of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, said on Tuesday he had not ruled out returning to Spain to attend a vote in the Catalan parliament to choose a new leader, despite facing arrest in that country on charges of sedition and rebellion.
""There are many possibilities,"" he told reporters in Brussels in reference to ways of voting or being sworn in as regional president. ""The ideal would be in person. It's what we all want. We don't rule out anything.""
Puigdemont fled to Brussels shortly after making an illegal declaration of independence for the wealthy northeastern region at the end of October and he faces a trial on charges that could result in a decades-long prison sentence if he returns to Spain.
However, he regained his seat in the Catalan parliament in a Dec. 21 election that was called by Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in the hope that pro-unity parties would win and resolve Spain's worst political crisis in decades. 
That ploy backfired, with parties in favor of a split gaining a slim majority. Puigdemont is the only candidate for regional president put forward by the newly-elected Catalan parliament. 
Supporters of Puigdemont have said he could rule remotely by video link. But the Catalan parliament's own legal experts have said this is not possible and Rajoy has said the government will seek to block any such move in the courts.

China held the first joint naval drill with Cambodia in 2016, tightening the relationship that could give Beijing a small but strategic foothold in a region being strongly courted by the United States.
Cambodia's armed forces have benefited greatly from Chinese military training and equipment including jeeps, rocket launchers and helicopters.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finns are expected to re-elect moderate Sauli Niinisto for a second six-year term in elections on Sunday, counting on his skill and caution to ensure a close relationship with NATO without antagonizing neighboring Russia.
Niinisto, 69, is credited with helping Finland perform a delicate balancing act between the Kremlin and the U.S.-led military alliance, of which it is not a member but with which it developed closer ties after Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014.
Latest opinion polls by Alma Media and Helsingin Sanomat show support of 58-68 percent for Niinisto, who is originally from conservative National Coalition Party (NCP) - a member of Helsinki's ruling coalition - but campaigns as an independent.
His closest rival, Pekka Haavisto of the Greens of Finland, has the support of 11-14 percent of respondents in the polls, while six other candidates share a combined backing of 21-28 percent.
Many Finns are wary of Russia, with which their Nordic country shares a 1,340 km (833 miles) border and a history of two wars between 1939 and 1944 which cost Finland substantial territory.
Though the role is largely ceremonial, the president oversees foreign policy, an area dominated by debate on NATO membership and relations with Russia. 
Though most people will vote on Sunday, 36 per cent of voters cast their ballot in a week of advance polling which closed on Tuesday.
If no candidate gets half of the votes on Sunday, a second round between two most voted candidates takes place on Feb. 11.
""We can't do anything about the fact that Russia is our neighbor, and it is good to be on good terms with neighbours,"" said pensioner Olle Relander after casting his vote for Niinisto in an advance polling station in Helsinki.
Though Finland backs western economic sanctions against Russia, Niinisto has appeared as a low-profile middle-man between East and West - a sharp contrast to his Baltic counterparts who regularly speak out against Moscow.
He was the first western leader to meet Russian president Vladimir Putin following the annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula.
Attending a NATO summit in Warsaw in July 2016, along with Sweden, he also actively pushed for an air safety agreement between Russia and the alliance in the Baltic region after a series of near misses between Russian jets and commercial European airlines.
""In today's circumstances, or any that can be foreseen ... I think we have no reason to seek NATO membership,"" Niinisto said in a TV interview with public broadcaster YLE this month.
""But, if Russia suddenly starts to see the whole of the West as an enemy, as it views NATO at the moment, then we are in a different situation,"" he said.
Public backing for joining NATO has lingered around 20 percent for years, although it briefly edged up in 2014 after Russia's action in Crimea.
Apart from his long service in politics, Niinisto also taps into much sympathy among Finns because of a series of personal dramas.
A lawyer by training, Niinisto was the finance minister in the 1990s, becoming known for his government's heavy austerity measures following Finland's depression, as well as the decision to join the euro area.
Quick-tempered in politics, he lost his first wife in a car accident in 1995. He survived the deadly 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami by climbing up an electricity pole in Thailand with his son.

""The independence of Romania's judicial system and its capacity to fight corruption effectively are essential cornerstones of a strong Romania in the European Union,"" the European Commission said in a statement.

PARIS (Reuters) - French riot police broke up a jailhouse picket on Wednesday that threatened to disrupt the trial of a man who is suspected of housing the head of a militant Islamist hit-squad that killed 130 people in attacks in Paris in 2015.
The picket was one of dozens nationwide by wardens striking over pay and inmate violence in France's overcrowded prisons, a protest that has snowballed into a full-blown showdown with the government of President Emmanuel Macron.
With the prison guards digging in, the stand-off is turning into a survival test for Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet, a high-flying law lecturer appointed by Macron last June following his election victory.
Union representatives stormed out of talks with Belloubet on Tuesday, describing her offer of 30 million euros in financial incentives as ""bonuses for slit throats"".
Wednesday's police operation at the Fresnes prison near Paris was ordered after threats by prison wardens to disrupt the transfer of Jawad Bendaoud to court, where he faces trial in connection with the deadly militant attacks of 2015.
Bendaoud is accused of providing the flat where Abdelhamid Abbaoud hid after he and a group of other gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people on November 2015.
Bendaoud's arrest was broadcast live and he pleaded innocent to the cameras before being carted off by police. He faces six years in jail if convicted of taking money for supplying the hideout.
DEMANDS
Two-thirds of France's 188 prisons were being disrupted by work stoppages and pickets on Wednesday morning, according to an official count.
Among the demands of the striking prison guards is that militant Islamist convicts -- those convicted of terrorism-related offences - be isolated from other prisoners, saying that some inmates are becoming radicalized through contact with them. 
The wardens also want more money for a job they say is becoming increasingly dangerous and equipment such as taser guns to help ensure order.
The protests began on Jan. 12 after an al Qaeda convict jailed over killings in Tunisia stabbed and injured two wardens with a pair of scissors in northern France. 
In some cases over the past 12 days, police have been sent into prisons to do the job of the striking wardens, and prisoners have been forced to spend more time in their cells.

Some jail cells house as many as three or four inmates in a space of 10 square meters (yards).

Firefighters are at the site and combating the blaze, said a Bandar Abbas fire official who ISNA identified only by the surname Aminizadeh. 
The fire broke out in a fuel storage tank at the factory, Aminizadeh told ISNA.
A fire at an Iranian oil refinery in Tehran’s Shar-e Rey district killed six workers and injured two others last October.
Since sanctions were lifted in 2016 under a multinational nuclear deal, Iran has signed contracts with foreign firms to repair and modernize its oil refineries.

841,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Japan tells U.N. of North Korean tanker suspected of sanctions busting,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has told the United Nations about a North Korean tanker spotted in the East China Sea that it suspects was engaged in a transfer of goods with another tanker in defiance of U.N. sanctions, the Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday.
North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and missiles capable of hitting the United States has spurred deepening U.N. Security Council sanctions and stoked fears of a military conflict.
According to a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry, the North Korean-flagged tanker ""Rye Song Gang 1"" - blacklisted by the United Nations last month for carrying banned cargo - was spotted by a Japanese Maritime Self Defence Force patrol plane with the Dominican-flagged tanker ""Yuk Tung"" tied up beside it in the East China Sea on Saturday.
The two boats were lit up and some kind of activity was taking place, the Foreign Ministry said, adding that the Japanese government strongly suspected them of transferring goods in violation of the U.N. sanctions.
It did not specify what goods it suspected were being transferred. The U.N. Security Council in December unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea for a recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to further limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil.
The ministry also said it appeared that the North Korean-flagged vessel, one of four additional vessels recently denied international port access by the United Nations for breaching sanctions, had disguised its name so that it read ""Song Hae.""
""We have reported this to the U.N. and also given this information to other nations involved, including those connected to the Dominican tanker, expressing our concern,"" the ministry added.
Diplomats from Dominica, a tiny Carribean island which suffered widespread damage in a hurricane in September, were not immediately available for comment. 
North Korea is developing missile and nuclear technology in defiance of international condemnation amid regular threats to destroy the United States, Japan and South Korea.

But tensions have eased with North Korea agreeing to take part in the Winter Olympics in the South next month.

""Such unilateral actions, as that of today, are detrimental to the spirit of cooperation between the two countries in the fight against terrorism,"" the statement said.

In an info graphic cited by Saudi-owned Al Arabiya on Wednesday, the attorney general said 90 detainees had been released after having their charges dropped while others had traded cash, real estate and other assets for their freedom.
""Only a couple of days till cases of corruption-related settlements are closed in preparation for referring remaining defendants to the Public Prosecution,"" the graphic said.
Saudi security forces have rounded up members of the political and business elite, including princes and tycoons, holding them in Riyadh's opulent Ritz Carlton hotel in what was billed as a war on rampant corruption.
The purge has caused concern about damage to the economy especially among foreign investors the kingdom is seeking to attract to develop its economy away from oil. But the government has insisted it is respecting due process and that the companies of detained businessmen will continue operating normally.
The allegations, which could not be verified, include kickbacks, inflating government contracts, extortion and bribery.
The Ritz is expected to reopen for business next month, and official sources have told Reuters that the authorities were close to winding up a major part of the crackdown. Riyadh hopes to recover about $100 billion of illicit funds and expects a small number to be prosecuted.
In late November, senior Saudi Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, once seen as a leading contender to the throne, was freed after reaching a settlement with authorities that involved paying more than $1 billion, according to a Saudi official.
Another top businessman who has been held at the Ritz-Carlton is billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman and owner of global investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE. A Saudi official told Reuters this week that he was negotiating a possible settlement but so far had not agreed on terms.
The attorney general's statement said those who were released are free to move without restrictions.

""Unfortunately, worrying news continues to arrive from the Democratic Republic of Congo,"" Francis told a crowd in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) after a regular general audience.
""I, therefore, renew my appeal that everyone make all efforts to avoid any form of violence. From its side, the Church wants nothing other than to contribute to peace and to the common good of society.""
The Catholic Church, which is highly influential in Congo, has become increasingly vocal in its condemnation of President Joseph Kabila's insistence on staying in office long after the end of his mandate.
At least six people were killed and dozens wounded as government-backed forces dispersed a protest on Sunday. 
 
"
845,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Congo is becoming like prison under Kabila: cardinal,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - The head of Congo's Catholic church condemned President Joseph Kabila's government on Tuesday for a deadly crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, suggesting his country was turning into a prison.
Tensions between the government and one of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's most powerful institutions has risen as the church has increasingly become a focal point for opposition to Kabila's efforts to stay in power without a mandate.
Security forces shot dead at least six people and wounded dozens more as they fired tear gas to disperse a protest on Sunday that the Catholic church had organized, drawing widespread international condemnation.
""We were dispersed by tear gas, stun grenades and live bullets. We have again seen deaths, injuries, priests being arrested, and the theft of citizens' property,"" Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo said at the church in the capital Kinshasa. 
""Christians were prevented from praying. Others were prevented from leaving by...police and military who were armed as if they had been on a battlefield,"" he said.
""How can you kill men, women, children, youths and old people all chanting religious songs, carrying bibles, rosaries and crucifixes? Are we now living in an open prison?""
A military spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kabila's refusal to step down at the end of his mandate in December 2016 has triggered a series of street protests in which scores have been killed in Kinshasa. It has also emboldened armed rebel groups in different parts of Congo. 
Congo's influential Roman Catholic Church has emerged as a flashpoint for opposition to Kabila, while his political opposition remains flimsy and divided. The tussle is increasingly a concern for Pope Francis.
""Unfortunately, worrying news continues to arrive from the Democratic Republic of Congo,"" Francis told a crowd in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) on Wednesday. ""I therefore renew my appeal that everyone make all efforts to avoid any form of violence."" 
Kabila blames delays in an election meant to replace him - it will not happen until the end of this year at the earliest - on logistical problems registering voters.
But the resulting instability has stoked fears that the vast, mineral-rich country could slide back into the wars that killed millions in the 1990s, mostly from hunger and disease.
Sunday's violence - an echo of bloodshed on New Year's Eve when Congolese forces killed at least seven people at a Catholic activists' protest in the capital - prompted condemnation from Western powers. 
France ""strongly condemns the violence perpetrated by the security forces"", the French Foreign Ministry said on Monday.
In a joint statement late on Tuesday, the embassies of the United States and Britain berated the authorities for ""using disproportionate and lethal force against Congolese civilians"", and cutting the internet for three days. 

""These government actions hinder the democratic process and ... breach international norms on human rights,"" it added.

The first blast on Tuesday evening hit worshippers leaving a mosque in Benghazi's central Al Salmani district. The second, about 15 minutes later, inflicted a large number of casualties among people who had gathered at the scene.
Senior security officials were among the casualties. 
The toll was one of the highest from a single attack since Libya slid into turmoil after the uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

Benghazi is controlled by the Libyan National Army (LNA), which is led by powerful eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar and was battling Islamists and other opponents in the port city until late last year.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 07:16AM ET</span>",Czech president asks PM Babis again to try to form new cabinet,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech President Milos Zeman on Wednesday asked Prime Minister Andrej Babis for a second time to try to form a new government after a minority administration he set up in December lost a confidence vote in parliament last week.
Babis, a billionaire businessman and leader of the anti-establishment ANO party which won last October's election, has struggled to find ruling partners as he faces charges of fraud in tapping an EU subsidy 10 years ago. He denies any wrongdoing.
Zeman accepted Babis's resignation on Wednesday but then immediately asked him to form another government, giving him a political mandate to negotiate with other parties. 
The two leaders have shelved past disputes to become political allies. Zeman had pledged to ask Babis to head another coalition, putting pressure on other parties to cooperate, while Babis and ANO endorsed Zeman in this weekend's presidential election run-off.
Zeman said on Wednesday he would provide time for Babis to cobble together a majority in the 200-seat lower house of parliament, where ANO only holds 78 seats. 
But he said that in case he lost this weekend's election, he would appoint Babis as prime minister again anyway before his term ends on March 7. ""There will be quite a short time for finding the necessary votes, so I will not insist on this condition,"" Zeman said at a joint news briefing with Babis.
Zeman, who has faced criticism for pursuing warmer relations with Russia and China, faces pro-European academic Jiri Drahos in the presidential run-off election round and opinion polls have them running neck and neck or give Drahos a slight edge.
But betting agencies have begun leaning toward Zeman in the past days.
Babis said he hoped rival parties would be more open to compromise in his second attempt at forming a government. 
Some parties indicated they were ready to talk, but only the anti-NATO Communist Party said it had no problem accepting Babis as prime minister given the investigation against him.
Babis has also had contacts with the far-right, anti-NATO and anti-EU SPD party, and ANO has joined those two factions in a number of parliamentary votes in recent weeks.
Babis has insisted his cabinet will take a pro-EU course and not give in to demands to hold a referendum on leaving the European Union, as Britain did in 2016. 

The former ruling party, the center-left Social Democrats, took a beating in the October election and will hold a congress next month on deciding whether to join forces with ANO.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam has jailed four men for flying the flag of the U.S.-backed Republic of Vietnam, the former state that spanned the southern half of the country until it was reunified at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, state media said on Wednesday.
Vuong Van Tha, 49, and his 28-year-old son, Vuong Thanh Thuan, were jailed for 12 and seven years each for ""conducting propaganda against the state"", state-run Vietnam News said. 
Twin brothers Nguyen Nhat Truong and Nguyen Van Thuong, both 33, received six-year sentences. The four were arrested in May last year but tried on Tuesday, state media said, and will serve a further three years under house arrest upon release.
Despite sweeping economic reform in Vietnam, and increasing openness toward social change, including gay, lesbian and transgender rights, the ruling Communist Party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism.
Vietnam News said the incident took place on April 30 last year, the anniversary of the fall of Saigon, now celebrated as ""Reunification Day"".
""Thuong and Truong came to Tha's house, where they were instructed, together with Tha's wife and daughter, to make the flag of the former Saigon regime,"" it added.
State media said Tha was a follower of the Hoa Hao Buddhist sect and ""regularly held gatherings to illegally evangelize"".
He posted a record of his ""anti-state activities"" on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), they added, using loudspeakers to ""slander the authorities and the Communist Party of Vietnam"".
The flag, a bright yellow rectangle with three thin horizontal stripes, is used by political activists in Vietnam who oppose the Communist-controlled government in Hanoi.
Tha flew the flag from the roof of his home and the four men resisted authorities' attempts to take it down, state media said.
In 2017, Vietnam arrested at least 21 bloggers and rights activists, New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week.
As many as 97 activists are serving prison sentences in Vietnam and 36 more are held in pre-trial detention, according to a database of the 88 Project website, which documents and advocates for Vietnamese dissidents.
Last week, the foreign ministry released a report on human rights it said had been entrenched in a constitution adopted in 2014 that reflected the ""institutionalization of human rights in Vietnam"".

""In recent years, Vietnam has witnessed extremely important achievements in the protection and promotion of human rights,"" it said.

The move comes amid a low point in relations between Pakistan and the United States which has suspended nearly $2 billion in assistance, accusing Islamabad of supporting Taliban militants causing chaos in neighboring Afghanistan.
RFE/RL says its Pashto language broadcast, known as Radio Mashaal, was a public service to counter extremist narrative in Pakistan's mountainous regions bordering Afghanistan. 
""Pakistan's Interior Ministry closed RFE/RL's bureau in Islamabad January 19 following accusations from the country's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency that RFE/RL programs are 'against the interest' of Pakistan,"" the news organization said. 
RFE/RL president Thomas Kent demanded the organization's journalists be allowed to resume their work ""without fear or delay"". 
The interior ministry didn't respond to requests for a response.
A senior government official told Reuters the issue with RFE/RL was linked to a faulty license application, rather than an intelligence directive.
The Pashtun tribal belt along the Afghan border has long been home to Islamist militants who want to overthrow Pakistan's government and install their own brand of Islamic law.
Analysts and human rights groups say space for critical media and dissent has been shrinking in Pakistan. They say the recent abductions and alleged torture of social media bloggers and writers were part of a campaign to silence dissent.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Wednesday condemned the ""evil"" of fake news, saying journalists and social media users should shun and unmask manipulative ""snake tactics"" that foment division to serve political and economic interests.
""Fake news is a sign of intolerant and hypersensitive
attitudes, and leads only to the spread of arrogance and hatred. That is the end result of untruth,"" Francis said in the first document by a pope on the subject.
It was issued after months of debate on how much fake news may have influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and the election of President Donald Trump.
The document, called ""The truth will set you free - Fake news and journalism for peace"", was issued in advance of the Catholic Church's World Day of Social Communications on May 13.
""Spreading fake news can serve to advance specific goals, influence political decisions, and serve economic interests,"" the pope writes, condemning the ""manipulative use of social networks"" and other forms of communication.
""This false but believable news is 'captious', inasmuch as it grasps people's attention by appealing to stereotypes and common social prejudices, and exploiting instantaneous
emotions like anxiety, contempt, anger and frustration,"" he said.
""SATAN'S SERPENT""
False stories spread so quickly that even authoritative denials often could not contain the damage done and many people run the risk of becoming ""unwilling accomplices in spreading biased and baseless ideas"", he said.
He called for ""education for truth"" that would help people discern, evaluate and understand news in order to recognize the ""sly and dangerous form of seduction that worms its way into the heart with false and alluring arguments"".
Francis compared the use of fake news to the Bible story of the devil, who, disguised as a serpent, persuaded Eve to eat the fruit of the forbidden tree. He said she was fed wrong information by Satan.
""We need to unmask what could be called the 'snake-tactics' used by those (purveyors of fake news) who disguise themselves in order to strike at any time and place,"" he said.
He said the role of journalists was ""not just a job, it is a mission"" and they had particular responsibility to stem fake news. 
""Amid feeding frenzies and the mad rush for a scoop, they must remember that the heart of information is not the speed with which it is reported or its audience impact, but persons,"" he said.
He said journalism should be ""less concentrated on breaking news than on exploring the underlying causes of conflicts ... a journalism committed to pointing out alternatives to the escalation of shouting matches and verbal violence.""

An international delegation advising Myanmar toured the Taung Pyo Letwe refugee camp outside the town of Maungdaw near the Bangladesh border. Video of the camp shows long, plywood houses set on a rocky field and surrounded by a wire mesh fence topped with barbed wire.
Bangladesh on Tuesday delayed the repatriation of the largely stateless Rohingya to Myanmar as the process of compiling and verifying the list of people to be sent back was incomplete.
But the United Nations said necessary safeguards for the refugees were still missing. 
""Until the safety and wellbeing of any child returning to Myanmar can be guaranteed, talk of repatriation is premature,"" UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Justin Forsyth said in a statement. 
The UN Refugee Agency UNHCR said earlier ""there are continued restrictions on access for aid agencies, the media and other independent observers"" in Myanmar.
The UNHCR called on Myanmar ""to allow the necessary unhindered humanitarian access in Rakhine State and create conditions for a genuine and lasting solution"". 
More than 688,000 Muslim Rohingya and a few hundred Hindu Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since Aug. 25 last year after the Myanmar military cracked down in the northern part of Rakhine state, amid witness reports of killings, looting and rape, in response to militant attacks on security forces.
Many in Buddhist-majority Myanmar regard the Rohingya community as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The United Nations described Myanmar's crackdown as ethnic cleansing, which Myanmar denies.
FILLING OUT FORMS 
Myanmar officials told a news conference on Tuesday that Bangladesh was not ready to send back the refugees as scheduled because the potential returnees hadn't completed the forms Myanmar provided attesting to their former residency in Myanmar.
""They also have to check with the UNHCR about whether it’s voluntary,"" Minister of International Cooperation Kyaw Tin told the news conference.
""They need a lot of time to fill out the forms and to determine if they really want to come back.""
A Bangladesh official who participated in the talks with Myanmar told Reuters the UNHCR would be involved in the process to ""ensure the repatriations would be voluntary"". 
""They (UNHCR) are already working with us...We want to make sure that the return is safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable,"" said the official, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media. 
He said Bangladesh was working toward signing a memorandum of understanding with UNHCR for the repatriation and it could take ""at least two months"" to start the return. 
But a UNHCR spokesperson in Bangladesh told Reuters the agency had not been involved ""in the bilateral discussions on repatriations or signed any agreements"". 
""We would like to be part of the process and discussions to ensure the reparations are voluntary, safe and sustainable and that any returns are in line with international standards,"" said Caroline Gluck, UNHCR's senior public information officer, in Cox’s Bazar.
Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed earlier this month to complete a voluntary repatriation of the refugees in two years. Myanmar says it has set up two reception centers and the temporary Taung Pyo Letwe camp to receive the first arrivals.
The plan has sparked fears in refugee camps in Bangladesh that people may be forced to return despite a lack of guarantees around their security. 

Late on Tuesday, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the delay in the repatriations was a good idea and Washington was concerned about a lack of access for U.N. organizations.

852,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",Mattis praises Vietnam's 'leadership' on North Korea sanctions,"By Phil Stewart and James  Pearson  (LON:PSON)
HANOI (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis praised Vietnam on Wednesday for adhering to sanctions against North Korea, saying at the start of a two-day visit to Hanoi that its leadership on the issue came despite the costs associated with lost trade.
""I have to pay my respects there and thank them for their support on the (North Korea) issue. They have been supporting the United Nations sanctions, at some cost to them,"" Mattis told reporters before landing in Hanoi.
""And so we appreciate their leadership on that, leading by example and stepping up.""
North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and missiles capable of hitting the United States has spurred deepening U.N. sanctions and stoked fears of a military conflict.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last week that the United States was getting evidence that sanctions were ""really starting to hurt"" North Korea, although there are no signs yet that they have altered Pyongyang's military calculus.
Vietnam and North Korea, at one time both within the influence of the former Soviet Union, maintain traditional diplomatic and political ties.
But those relations have been tested in recent years, particularly following the alleged involvement of a Vietnamese citizen in the murder of Kim Jong Un's half brother in 2017.
    Hanoi expelled blacklisted North Koreans last year by asking them to voluntarily leave, taking into account ""traditional relations"" between the two countries, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.
In a report to the U.N. Security Council in April 2017, Vietnam also said it had taken measures to implement U.N. sanctions on North Korea.
Mattis said Vietnam was adhering to those sanctions and noted that cutting off trade with a country so close carried an economic cost to Vietnam.
""DPRK sells coal very cheaply and so obviously if they turn that off, there could be costs associated,"" Mattis explained, referring to North Korea by the initials of its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
SOUTH CHINA SEA
Mattis' first stop in Vietnam was to a U.S. Defense Department office in Hanoi that sits just across the street from the North Korean embassy and seeks to recover the remains of U.S. troops killed in the 1965-75 Vietnam War. 
Some 1,293 U.S. forces are still unaccounted for, one U.S. official said.
Mattis' trip comes amid steadily strengthening U.S.-Vietnamese ties, including between their two militaries, as both countries seek to put the Vietnam War firmly behind them. 
Relations these days are seen largely through shared concern over China's aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, where more than $3 trillion in cargo passes every year. 
Vietnam has emerged as the most vocal opponent of China's expansive territorial claims and has been buying U.S. military hardware, including its acquisition of an armed, Hamilton-class Coast Guard cutter.
The ship, one U.S. official said, was larger than anything Vietnam had in its navy.
""(Vietnam) does have one of the region's fastest growing economies and so freedom of navigation and access in the South China Sea will be critical to them economically and of course in their security efforts,"" Mattis said.

ANKARA/BEIRUT (Reuters) - The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) rejected a Turkish army statement that Islamic State was present in the Afrin region of northwestern Syria, where Ankara launched an offensive four days ago which has raised international concern.
The Turkish military said late on Tuesday it had killed at least 260 Syrian Kurdish fighters and Islamic State militants in its offensive into the Kurdish-dominated Afrin region of northwest Syria.
Turkey's air and ground operation has opened a new front in Syria's multi-sided civil war and could threaten U.S. plans to stabilize and rebuild a large area of northeast Syria - beyond President Bashar al-Assad's control - where Washington helped the SDF to drive out Islamic State militants.
""The whole world knows Daesh (Islamic State) is not present in Afrin,"" Redur Xelil, a senior SDF official, told Reuters. He said the Turkish military had greatly exaggerated SDF casualties, though he declined to say how many had been killed.
Turkey sees the YPG - the most powerful faction within the SDF - as an extension of a Kurdish group that has waged a decades-long insurgency in southeastern Turkey. It has long said it will not allow the Kurdish fighters to control a strip of Syrian territory on its southern border.
U.S. President Donald Trump plans to raise concerns with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in a phone call expected on Wednesday about Ankara's offensive against Kurdish YPG fighters in Afrin, a senior U.S. official said.
French President Emmanuel Macron also voiced disquiet, a few hours after Turkey's foreign minister said it wanted to avoid any clash with U.S., Russian or Syrian government forces during its offensive but would do whatever necessary for its security.
The United States and Russia both have military forces in Syria backing opposing sides and have called for Turkish restraint in its ""Operation Olive Branch"", meant to crush the YPG in the Afrin region near Turkey's southern border. 
A senior Trump administration official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said Ankara had sent ""conflicting signals"" about the scope of the offensive.
""We're going to have to see how this develops on the ground. But our message has been unified. We would appreciate it and we would urge them to limit the incursion as much as possible.""
Erdogan told Macron on Tuesday that Turkey was taking all measures to prevent civilian casualties in the Afrin operation, sources at the presidential palace said. The two leaders agreed to stay in close contact on the issue.
The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had also discussed Turkey's operation with Erdogan by phone and that Syria's territorial integrity and sovereignty had to be respected.
A Kremlin statement said both men stressed the importance of continuing their two countries' joint work to try to find a peaceful resolution to Syria's crisis. Russia has been Assad's most powerful ally against rebels and militants in Syria.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu reiterated Ankara's demand that Washington stop supporting the YPG.
Ankara has said the operation will be swift, but Erdogan's spokesman signaled an open-ended cross-border campaign, saying it would end only when some 3.5 million Syrian refugees now living in Turkey could safely return home. 
The United States hopes to use the YPG's control in northern Syria to give it the diplomatic muscle it needs to revive U.N.-led talks in Geneva on a deal that would end Syria’s civil war.
NEAR BREAKING POINT
Ankara has been infuriated by the U.S. support for the YPG, which is one of several issues that have brought ties between Washington and its Muslim NATO ally close to breaking point.
""The future of our relations depends on the step the United States will take next,"" Cavusoglu said.
Turkey's military, the second largest in NATO, has conducted air strikes and artillery barrages against targets in Afrin, and its soldiers and allied Syrian rebels tried to thrust into the Kurdish-held district from west, north and eastern flanks.
With heavy cloud hindering air support in the last 24 hours, advances have been limited and Kurdish militia have retaken some territory. Turkish troops and the Syrian fighters have been trying to take the summit of Bursaya Hill, overlooking the eastern approach to Afrin town.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said 23 civilians had been killed in Turkish shelling and air strikes, and thousands were fleeing the fighting.
However, Syrian government forces were preventing people from crossing government-held checkpoints to reach the Kurdish-held districts of nearby Aleppo city, it said.
Xelil, the SDF official, said the SDF had killed tens of Turkish forces and allied Free Syrian Army fighters, but said he did not have a precise figure. 
YPG THREAT
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Turkey's offensive was distracting from efforts to defeat Islamic State. 
Ankara says the jihadist group is largely finished in Syria and that the greater threat comes from the YPG.
Erdogan has said Turkey aims to destroy YPG control not just in the Afrin enclave but also in the mainly Arab town of Manbij to the east. 
""Terrorists in Manbij are constantly firing provocation shots. If the United States doesn't stop this, we will stop it,"" Cavusoglu was reported as saying on Tuesday. 
""Our goal is not to clash with Russians, the Syrian regime or the United States, it is to battle the terrorist organization,"" broadcaster Haberturk quoted him as saying.
He tweeted that a lieutenant had become the second Turkish soldier to be killed in the operation. The Observatory said 43 rebels fighting alongside the Turks had also been killed, as well as 38 on the Kurdish side.
Later on Tuesday, Cavusoglu discussed the crisis with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during a conference in Paris.
Erdogan's spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said the military operations would continue until Syrian refugees in Turkey ""return home safely and the separatist terror organization has been cleansed from the region"".
The Kurdish-led administration of northeastern Syria appealed for a mass mobilization in defense of Afrin. ""We call on all our people to defend Afrin and its pride, and contribute in all the related activities,"" it said, without elaborating.

A U.N. report, citing local sources, said about 5,000 people in the Afrin district had been displaced as of Monday but that some of the most vulnerable had been unable to flee. It said the United Nations was ready to provide aid to 50,000 in Afrin.

Many Indonesians remain suspicious of the Communist Party and its beliefs, even though it has been banned since 1965, and there is little evidence that sympathizers are active in the world's largest Muslim-majority nation. 
Environmentalist Heri Budiawan was accused of spreading communist ideology by displaying symbols like the hammer and sickle during a protest against a gold mining company in East Java province. The maximum penalty is 12 years in jail.
""Protesting is a constitutional right and the judge's decision threatens democracy,"" said Budiawan's lawyer, Abdul Wachid Habibullah, adding there was no evidence his client had broken the law but he had not yet decided whether to appeal.
Rights activists said the ruling could revive the misuse of anti-communism laws that date back to Suharto's repressive New Order regime. 
""The conviction provides a legal pretext for communism or 'red scares' to be used by politicians to...increase their own legitimacy by scapegoating minorities or those accused of being communist,"" said Usman Hamid, director of Amnesty International Indonesia. 
Indonesia used to have the world's second-largest communist party after China.
But it saw a brutal purge of suspected Communist Party members and sympathizers in 1965, when, according to historians, about 500,000 people were killed and a million jailed after then-general Suharto and the military took power following an abortive communist coup. 
Last year, a meeting by human rights activists and victims of the 1965 purge was shut down after Islamists and nationalists rioted outside the venue.

Abdelhakim Labidi Adib, 20, was stopped on Monday at a checkpoint on Basilan, home to an extremist faction of the Abu Sayyaf group that was led by Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State's ""Emir"" in Southeast Asia, until his death in October.
Adib is suspected of being an extremist sympathizer and was detained without charge, as permitted by martial law, which is in force across the Mindanao region, where Basilan is located.
Captain Exequil Panti, head of the special forces on Basilan, said Adib was not initially a suspect but had been stopped because he was with another man believed to be an Abu Sayyaf member.
Panti said the men ran away from troops and Adib threw aside his backpack, which was later found to contain detonators, blasting caps and grenades. The other man escaped, Panti said.
Adib said he was a tourist and denied owning the bag during questioning at the justice ministry in Manila on Wednesday, where media were also present.
""I am innocent of the accusation against me,"" he said. ""The accusation is not true."" 
Basilan is a no-go area for most Filipinos and Western countries typically warn citizens to stay away, because of the penetration of Abu Sayyaf and fierce military offensives against its fighters.
Abu Sayyaf is also notorious for making vast sums of money from piracy and kidnapping. Canadians and a German were among the Westerners beheaded by Abu Sayyaf when ransoms were not paid.

The comments were the second time in less than a week that Duterte expressed anger about alleged abuse in Kuwait, where he said low-paid Filipinos were made to endure rape and starvation.
He asked the governments of Kuwait and other Middle East countries, where more than a million Filipinos work, to take steps to end the abuse and ""to treat my countrymen as human beings with dignity"".
""I hope I am not committing a diplomatic faux pas. But one more incident ... I'm going to ban,"" he said in a speech before leaving for a regional summit in India.
""And I'm sorry, the Filipinos there, you can all go home,"" he said. ""If you leave, they will also be having a hell of a time adjusting to that.""
On Friday, the labor ministry suspended deployment of workers to Kuwait, a day after Duterte said abuse had driven several domestic helpers to suicide.
Kuwait initially expressed surprise and said it was in touch with Manila to try to resolve the issue.
More than 250,000 Filipinos work in Kuwait, the Philippine foreign ministry estimates, most of them as domestic helpers. There are also large numbers in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
Remittances by overseas Filipinos amount to more than $2 billion a month, keeping domestic demand robust in one of the world's fastest-growing economies.
Duterte said Kuwait was an ally, but abuse should not be tolerated. 

""I hope that you'd listen to me,"" he said. ""We may need your help, but we will not do it at the expense of the dignity of the Filipino.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is gathering the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Regional Cooperation (ASEAN) for a summit on Thursday to promote maritime security in a region dominated by China, officials and diplomats said.
India has been pursuing an ""Act East"" policy of developing political and economic ties with Southeast Asia, but its efforts have been tentative and far trail China, whose trade with ASEAN was more than six times India's in 2016-17 at $470 million.
China has also expanded its presence in South Asia, building ports and power plants in countries around India's periphery, such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and spurring New Delhi to seek new allies.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has invited the leaders of all ten ASEAN nations to join him in the Republic Day celebrations on Friday in the biggest ever gathering of foreign leaders at the parade that showcases military might and cultural diversity.
The leaders, who include Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, will hold talks on maritime cooperation and security, the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement. 
Both India and the Southeast Asia nations have stressed the need for freedom of navigation and open seas and India already has strong naval ties with countries such as Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, Preeti Saran, secretary in the Indian foreign ministry, said.
""The ongoing activities of ship visits, of coordinated patrols, of exercises that take place bilaterally, are taking place very well,"" Saran said. ""And every time we have defense to defense talks or navy to navy talks, there is a great deal of satisfaction that has been expressed by the ASEAN member countries.""
But several Southeast Asian countries locked in territorial disputes with China have sought even greater Indian engagement in the region, experts say. 
""China's distinctly hegemonic moves in the last few years in the South China Sea and its growing assertiveness have made ASEAN look towards India as a partner for equilibrium,"" said Arvind Gupta, former Indian deputy national security adviser who now heads the influential Vivekananda International Foundation in New Delhi with close ties to the ruling government.
But India, which has been building up its navy, is wary of getting entangled in South China Sea disputes and provoking a backlash from China. 
One of the plans the Indian and ASEAN leaders will be discussing at the close-door summit on Thursday will be for their navies to exercise near the Malacca Straits between Malaysia and Singapore, one of the busiest routes for international shipping, a navy official said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong needs to tighten rules to ensure the Asian financial hub is not used to violate international sanctions on North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions, a senior U.S. Treasury official said on Wednesday.
North Korea is developing missile and nuclear technology in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions amid regular threats to destroy the United States and Japan. But tensions have eased with North Korea agreeing to take part in the Winter Olympics in the South next month.
Bordering China, Hong Kong benefits from a surge of capital flows from the mainland that some say is one of the sources of dirty funds for North Korea.
Hong Kong has come under pressure from international bodies to clamp down on illegal money flows following cases involving local firms including so-called fake trade invoicing that allows billions of dollars of capital to leave China illegally.
The former British colony has been beefing up its anti-money laundering laws, after recent scandals showed that Hong Kong was the most active center in the world for the creation of shell companies.
""Hong Kong, of course, is an international financial hub and at the same time it has company formation and registration rules that we think need to be stronger,"" said Sigal Mandelker, the U.S. Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.
""We have also stressed here in Hong Kong the importance of having the appropriate mechanism in place to enforce UN Security Council resolutions and other regulations prohibiting activities that facilitate financial transactions with North Korea.""
Referring to her talks with Hong Kong officials, Mandelker said Hong Kong should continue to enhance and enforce laws to send a strong message that the financial hub would not be a place to ""facilitate front company, shell company"" activities.
The U.S. official, who visited and held talks with her counterparts in China on Tuesday, said she emphasized the need for Beijing to expel North Korean ""financial facilitators"" identified by Washington.
U.S. President Donald Trump in an interview with Reuters last week praised China for its efforts to restrict oil and coal supplies to North Korea but said Beijing could do much more to help constrain Pyongyang.

Trump criticized Russia for helping North Korea evade international sanctions, saying Pyongyang was getting ""closer every day"" to being able to deliver a long-range missile to the United States.

862,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 04:19AM ET</span>",Thailand charges nine in anti-government protests dating to 2013,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand on Wednesday charged nine leaders of anti-government protests in 2013 and 2014 with inciting insurrection and sedition in an attempt to oust Yingluck Shinawatra, who was prime minister at the time. 
The People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) and its supporters took to the streets for seven months, aiming to rid Thailand of the influence of Yingluck, and her billionaire brother, ousted former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who had massive support among the rural poor in the north and northeast.
Their governments were overthrown in 2014 and 2006 coups respectively.
Nine protest leaders, including Suthep Taugsuban, face eight charges over their roles in the bloody street protests, including insurrection, sedition, and obstructing a 2014 general election, said Prayut Bejraguna, a deputy spokesman for the office of the attorney-general. 
Suthep and one other protest leader also face an additional terrorism charge, Prayut added. 
The nine men pleaded not guilty to the charges, Suthep told reporters after the court session, adding that each was granted bail of 600,000 baht ($18,969) and barred from traveling overseas until the end of the trial. 
""Whether we are right or wrong, we will fight it out in the justice process...because we believe in Thailand's justice system,"" Suthep said. 
""We will insist on pushing to reform Thailand, no matter at what cost."" 
Prayut said Thailand's attorney-general planned to file charges against 34 other PDRC leaders who did not show up in court on Wednesday. 
Tension has festered in Thailand since the 2006 coup removed Thaksin. Thailand is divided broadly between those backing Thaksin and Yingluck, whose government was ousted in 2014, and the elite in the capital, Bangkok.
Thaksin is credited by some as being the first Thai prime minister to tap into the potential of the rural electorate. But his enemies accuse him of corruption, which he denies.
Thaksin and Yingluck live abroad. Yingluck fled Thailand last August, ahead of a verdict in a negligence trial that eventually found her guilty and handed down a five-year jail term. Thaksin fled to avoid a 2008 jail term for corruption.

The incursion targets the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish YPG, viewed by Ankara as a terrorist group and an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast since 1984. 
Politicians, journalists and activists are among those who have been arrested over their social media posts, according to the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), the second largest opposition party in parliament. 
Police have staged operations in 31 provinces, with 11 suspects remanded in custody pending trial and seven people released, state-run Anadolu news agency said, citing police officials. Questioning of the other 132 is continuing, it said.
""Police officials said that social media accounts are being monitored ceaselessly and that all users who spread terror groups' propaganda will be prosecuted,"" Anadolu said.
Ankara has enforced a crackdown since a failed coup in 2016 that critics say has unjustly targeted pro-Kurdish politicians. Some HDP lawmakers have been jailed on terrorism charges, which they deny. 
In total, more than 50,000 people have been jailed and face trial since the attempted putsch and 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from their jobs. The government says the moves were necessary given the security threats Turkey faces.

On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the Syrian government may still be using chemical weapons, following a suspected chlorine attack in the rebel enclave of eastern Ghouta on Monday. 
In a statement carried by state news agency SANA, Syria's foreign ministry said such claims were aimed at ""obstructing any effort toward finding a way out of the crisis in Syria"". 
In 2013 Syria said it would give up all of its chemical weapons. 
In the past two years, a joint U.N. and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inquiry found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin and several times used chlorine as a weapon.
The Syrian army and government have consistently denied using chlorine or other chemical weapons during the war, now in its seventh year.

Police chief Ronald dela Rosa said police would wear body cameras to record arrests, under a Jan. 19 memorandum made public on Wednesday that takes effect once the devices are procured.
The police are making a comeback in President Rodrigo Duterte's ferocious anti-narcotics campaign, a few months after he suspended them amid unprecedented scrutiny of their conduct.
""Once they are available, we will require them to wear that,"" Dela Rosa said of the cameras.
""We would have a policy where there will be no anti-drug operations without body-worn cameras,"" he told reporters.
He did not specify a date by which the cameras are expected to be made available to police, however.
Police data shows nearly 4,000 drug suspects were killed since Duterte came to power and launched the crackdown in June 2016, but police insist all died because they violently resisted arrest.
Police reject activists' allegations that they are executing suspected drug users and dealers in a systematic campaign of abuses and cover-ups. In his war on drugs, Duterte has been accused of allowing a culture of impunity to flourish.
In the same memorandum, Dela Rosa ordered police to immediately take injured suspects to hospital, and establish a data base of those who died in police operations.
In June, Reuters revealed that police have shot hundreds of people during anti-drug operations, before taking them to hospitals where they are declared dead on arrival. Police say they're trying to save lives. Bereaved relatives and other witnesses say police are sending corpses to hospitals to disrupt crime scenes and cover up extrajudicial killings.
Police were also ordered to limit the much-feared ""Oplan Tokhang"" operations, when they visit homes of users and dealers and seek their surrender, to between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. (2400-1200 GMT) on weekdays, police spokesman Dionardo Carlos told a separate media briefing.
""It has to be daytime, so as to erase the impression that if you have been the subject of Tokhang, you would be killed,"" Carlos said, adding police would be required to wear their uniforms during such operations. 
The Philippines has hit back at New York-based Human Rights Watch for what it called a misleading death toll of more than 12,000 in the drugs war, putting the number at half that.

The city will ""ensure zero increase of such structures"" this year and will continue to relocate people out of the city center, acting mayor Chen Jining said in an annual work report to the city's government on Wednesday. 
Beijing last year set a similar goal to demolish 40 million square meters of illegal structures, but there was no indication in this year's report whether the target was met. 
Beijing launched a citywide safety blitz in November following a deadly fire that has resulted in the demolition of buildings that violate safety codes and the eviction of thousands of migrant workers from their homes and businesses.
The evictions sparked unusually direct criticism from China's intellectuals, students and journalists, who say the government is unfairly targeting the vulnerable underclass.
There will also be no letting up in a campaign to sanitize ancient hutong alleyways that last year displaced migrants as many were evicted from homes and businesses were shut down along the narrow passageways. 
The city will continue to ""close small shops operated from illegal openings cut in the wall"", the report said, referring to what the city says are illegal modifications to the traditional structures. 
Authorities will also preserve the historical areas of Beijing, including the appropriation of properties, though Chen said housing will be provided for those relocated. 
Beijing has been moving what it calls ""non-capital functions"" out of the city in order to relieve traffic congestion and pressure on public services, with the Xiongan New Area announced last year as a major focus for regional development. 
""Whatever support Xiongan needs, we will be there to provide it,"" said Chen.

GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Confrontations between young Palestinians and Israeli soldiers have taken on a life of their own since Palestinian leaders called for protests against Donald Trump's decision to treat Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
While Hamas, Fatah and other groups call for a weekly show of strength on Fridays, dozens of stone-throwers turn out along the border between Gaza and Israel every day, even when, as last Friday, a protest is called off due to bad weather.
Some wear the colors of the various factions vying to lead the drive for a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, but others have no affiliation, a sign of alienation that makes the political situation more volatile.
""I am not against any of the factions, but we are grown-ups and are intelligent and we see that the ongoing division is weakening us all,"" said a 28-year-old protester, referring to a renewed standoff between the Islamist Hamas and secular Fatah.
The two groups have long been rivals and have failed to achieve any lasting unity agreement in years of off-and-on negotiations. Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip from Fatah forces in 2007.
Conscious of the growing influence of the youth due to their ballooning numbers, both Hamas and Fatah have recently tried to court them, holding large, separate meetings in Gaza to convince them to back reconciliation.
But, as the daily scene on the border shows, young Palestinians are increasingly beyond reach, put off by a four-year stalemate in peace talks with Israel and little progress toward healing internal rifts.
Their growing frustration surfaces in social media criticism of their leaders that is met by with an increasingly authoritarian response.
The stone-throwers say the more alienated they feel, the greater the likelihood they will take to the streets to protest.
""We are hungry and at home we have no electricity and our fathers have no jobs. This can't bring about anything except an explosion,"" said a 23-year-old unemployed history graduate who gave his name as Ahmed.
Asked about the target of such an explosion, he said: ""Against the Israeli occupation, because it bears prime responsibility for everything, even for the division between Hamas and Fatah.""

ELECTIONS?
Palestinian politicians have agreed to hold long-delayed elections in both territories this year as part of moves to end the schism that led to Hamas seizing control of Gaza in 2007 from the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority based in the larger West Bank.
Whether they will materialize is unclear.
Palestinian security officials have over the past few years questioned many people, sometimes for weeks, about social media posts criticizing Fatah and Hamas, according to Palestinian human rights groups and New York-based Human Rights Watch.
In Gaza, most complaints center on electricity shortages that date back 11 years, with both groups seen at fault.
Slow unity efforts are another hot-button issue: some blame Hamas for balking at handing full control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority while others criticize Fatah for retaining salary cuts in Gaza.
Fatah is also faulted for the fact that its engagement in peace talks with Israel has brought little progress toward a Palestinian state and for keeping aging leaders in place.
People aged 15 to 29 make up a third of the population of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and partially blockaded Gaza strip and a disproportionate number of the many unemployed.
""There is no party that represents me or that I can say 'this party speaks for me,'"" said Oula Jabara, a university student in the occupied West Bank aged 20, who was a child when Mahmoud Abbas was elected president in 2005.
Almost three quarters of university students and 69 percent of all 18 to 22-year-olds want Abbas to resign, compared with 59 percent of Palestinians aged 50 and above, a December poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research showed.
Hasan Faraj, the Secretary General of Fatah's Youth Movement, declined to provide membership numbers, calling it an internal matter. He said the movement remained relevant with ""tens of thousands"" of official members, and more affiliated. 
The lack of transparency underscores a common complaint by young people that party leaders do not think they count.
Of six people interviewed at protests against Trump's Jerusalem move, none was prepared to say who they wanted to replace Abbas.
""Whoever it is will just be like the last,"" said Taha, a 33-year-old cook who declined to give his last name and wore a mask to avoid identification by Israeli authorities.
""I don't have faith in any of the parties.""
In the absence of political dialogue either within Palestinian factions or between them and Israel, many young Palestinians suffer in silence and some take to the streets.
Palestinian uprisings erupted in 1987 and in 2000, the latter after the failure of U.S.-sponsored peace talks. A build-up of grievances could spark a new one, but it would likely take broad public support among Palestinians and involvement by factions to keep it going.
""Non-affiliated youth may fuel an uprising, a short but aggressive one, but they can't sustain it,"" said Palestinian political analyst Akram Attallah.
Sixteen Palestinians and one Israeli have been killed in protests since Trump's Dec. 6 announcement and hundreds of Palestinians have been injured, eight on the Gaza border on Friday alone, according to the territory's health ministry.
A 13-year-old boy on the border said he had been hit twice by rubber bullets. His mother had warned him a third hit could be fatal and his father had beaten him to try to keep him away.

""I always find an excuse to slip out,"" he said. ""So what, I will be a martyr.""

872,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 02:30AM ET</span>","Malaysian makeover: At 92, Mahathir seeks to be PM again","By A. Ananthalakshmi and Joseph Sipalan
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - At 92, Mahathir Mohamad will become the world's oldest person to be voted prime minister if he wins Malaysia's upcoming general election. But to do that, he needs to woo people in their 20s and 30s, the country's dominant - and mostly undecided - vote block.
With the Southeast Asian nation's next election due by August, Mahathir is reworking his image - no longer the autocratic prime minister who ruled Malaysia for over two decades, he is projecting himself as the opposition's avuncular elder statesman. 
He has a vibrant Twitter feed, peppered with selfies and cheerful posts to endear himself with millennials. 
""Seeking inspiration to fight Dark Forces,"" read a tweet Mahathir posted in December with a photo of him and his wife watching 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'. It went viral, with over 8,500 retweets and around 15,000 likes.
Mahathir's makeover includes burying the hatchet with his fiercest critic and former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who he sacked in 1998 and jailed the following year on charges of corruption and sodomy, which is a crime in Malaysia. Their feud has shaped the country's political landscape over the past two decades.
Anwar is now serving a second prison term on a sodomy charge, but has signaled his acceptance to Mahathir leading the opposition campaign to oust current Prime Minister Najib Razak and his ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) alliance. In return, Mahathir has promised he will seek a royal pardon for Anwar if he wins the election and then step aside and let him be prime minister.
""I'm not apologetic for Mahathir's past,"" said Nurul Izzah, the 37-year-old daughter of Anwar who is the co-director for the opposition's election campaign.
""I put on record, he has a lot to answer for and I'm appreciative that he did not defend himself on the day of taking up the position (of prime ministerial candidate),"" she said in an interview.
Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, has been named the candidate for deputy prime minister.
""I am indebted and I say thank you to Anwar,"" Mahathir said after he was declared the prime ministerial candidate, saying it would not have been easy for Anwar to accept the deal. 
DIVISIVE FIGURE
Mahathir's image on social media is that of a droll but sage father-figure coming out of political retirement to help right the wrongs of Najib and his government.
""He has reincarnated himself well. You can't find 'Mahathir the dictator' on his social media platforms,"" said Adib Zalkapli, an analyst with risk consultancy Vriens & Partners. ""Young voters, especially those below the age of 30, do not remember his history with Anwar or his leadership style.""
Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman, the youth chief of Mahathir's party and manager of his Twitter account, says the ex-premier carefully works on his online image. He writes down social media posts on paper and hands it over, Syed Saddiq said.
""I only help type in. He does everything,"" said the 25-year-old youth leader.
The messaging appears to be working - Mahathir's Twitter following rose from 15,000 early last year to over 300,000 now.
""On Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), his target demographic are in their 30s and 40s, and on Twitter he interacts with millennials. He's also planning on starting an Instagram account,"" said Syed Saddiq, adding he finds it hard to keep up with Mahathir.
Between 2013 and 2017, about two million new voters registered in Malaysia, many of whom are between the ages of 21 and 30, according to estimates by independent polling agency Merdeka Center.
Malaysians between 21 and 40 accounted for 42 percent of the 14.6 million registered voters in the second quarter of 2017, according to estimates by youth voting advocacy group Watan.
A survey published in September by Merdeka Center, an independent polling agency, found that 70 percent of respondents between the ages of 21 to 30 were not interested in politics and were far more concerned with inflation, corruption and their livelihoods.
Most young Malaysians only know Mahathir as the ""father of modernization"", who brought a diversified and high-tech manufacturing base to an economy that had long relied on plantations and mining.
JAILED WITHOUT TRIAL
But many others remember the accusations against him of cronyism, undermining the judiciary and suppressing dissent. In the 1980s, many opposition and civil society leaders were jailed without trial, and newspapers critical of Mahathir's administration were shut down.
Kua Kia Soong, a former opposition lawmaker who was among those detained in the 1980s, says he blames Mahathir for building the very system that he is now trying to fight.
""To have such a person as the leader of the opposition to Najib and the Barisan Nasional is a big letdown,"" he said. 
""He hasn't shown he is a born-again democrat.""
Mahathir turned on his former protege Najib in 2015 after news broke of a multi-billion-dollar scandal involving state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), which faces money-laundering probes in at least six countries.
Najib has denied any wrongdoing.
A Merdeka Center survey in December showed that Najib is likely to retain power in the next elections thanks to a divided opposition and the redrawing of electoral boundaries that critics say favors the government.
The opposition Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) has refused to join Mahathir's coalition, raising the possibility of multi-cornered contests that will likely split opposition votes.
Najib's alliance won 133 seats of 222 parliamentary seats in the 2013 elections but lost the popular vote. The opposition got 89 seats, including 21 that went to PAS.
The opposition will need to lean on Mahathir to bring in young voters and rural Malays - a demographic that the opposition has long failed to win. Mahathir, his supporters say, appeals to both segments.

""In rural areas, Mahathir is a household name. He is an important factor when it comes to the rural Malays,"" said Saifuddin Abdullah, an opposition leader aligned with Mahathir.

873,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 02:19AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Somalia lures defectors in new push against insurgents,"By Katharine Houreld
MOGADISHU (Reuters) - As an undercover operative for Somalia's al Shabaab militia, Nasteh spied on the insurgent group's senior commanders to ensure their loyalty and planned bombings and assassinations in government-controlled territory. 
But late last year, the government officials he once hunted became his handlers after the 26-year-old joined a slowly growing stream of defectors to the U.N.-backed Somali administration. 
A Western-backed push by Somali officials to encourage al Shabaab defections has lured commanders, the former head of intelligence and a major regional warlord, security officials and defectors told Reuters, offering a rare window into secretive efforts to undermine the al Qaeda-linked insurgency from within. 
Senior defectors provide operational intelligence - such as how al Shabaab makes armored vehicle bombs - and insights into its leadership. 
Most importantly, the government says, those defectors sow suspicion among al Shabaab's leaders and encourage further defections by contacting former comrades. 
The message: defectors are welcomed, not punished. One former commander relocated abroad with his family; another now holds a senior position in the security services. Many have simply returned home, Somali officials say. 
Others, like Nasteh, are becoming intelligence assets after saying they are disillusioned with the Islamist insurgency, accusing it of un-Islamic practices.
""They were killing clerics,"" he told Reuters during an interview via video link from a safe house, naming three Islamic scholars he said were killed by the movement. ""They were killing without consultation, it was just the guys at the top deciding.""
The amnesty has angered some Somalis, who say those who commit crimes should be punished. Critics say the government has failed to penetrate the insurgency's core - the top three defectors had all fallen out of favor with Shabaab's inner circle.
The stakes are high: al Shabaab, which wants to overthrow the Somali government and impose Islamic law, has killed hundreds of civilians across East Africa and thousands of Somalis in a decade-long insurgency.
The full effect of the defections is unclear, although al Shabaab was needled into denouncing one former top commander, Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansur, as an apostate after he publicly urged his clansmen to fight the insurgency. Robow joined the government in August.
Government officials say only negotiation can end Somalia's 26-year-old civil war - especially given the ragged state of the military.
""Those [defectors] who have been rehabilitated can be ambassadors back to their communities,"" said Abdirahman Osman, a former minister of information who is now Mogadishu's mayor. ""We know military pressure helps, but it is not the end game."" 
THE PROCESS
Defections start with a phone call - from an al Shabaab fighter to his soldier cousin, or a former student to his teacher. Somalia's clan relationships mean everyone knows someone on the other side. 
""Their only request usually is not to go to jail. Most don't need to be resettled or sent anywhere,"" said one Somali who helped bring over defectors and asked not to be named. 
The Shabaab member is passed to someone working with the government - often known to them personally - and told he'll be welcomed if he rejects the insurgency, renounces violence, and accepts the Somali government. Clan elders act as guarantors.
The defector then plans his escape, which can take months. Al Shabaab has tried to prevent defections by requiring senior members to get travel passes, two defectors told Reuters, forcing some to take circuitous routes through the bush.
""I didn't tell my wife ... I didn't eat. I barely slept. I left all my books, threw away all my SIM cards that they knew,"" said a former district level head of education, describing his week-long escape by motorbike. 
Deserting is irrevocable, Somali officials say, because Shabaab jails or executes defectors. So far, they say, none of the 45 mid- and high-level defectors have reneged on their agreement. Twenty-two of those came across since January 2017.
Al Shabaab told Reuters the defections were exaggerated and more than 50 soldiers – including senior commanders - had surrendered to the insurgency in the past three months. 
""The apostate Somali regime often resorts to fabricated reports in a desperate attempt manipulate public opinion and hide its mounting security failures in the capital and the endemic corruption hampering all its institutions,"" said Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, the insurgency's military operations spokesman.
""As for the so-called deserters, most of them were already working as spies for the apostate regime. Once their cover was blown, they fled (al Shabaab) territories for fear of being executed ... Others were successfully apprehended before they could flee and were put to trial.""
Osman said the claim that 50 soldiers had surrendered was ""rubbish"".
The defectors are varied. Some come from the insurgency's proselytising wing; others are military commanders, or from logistics, medical, intelligence, tax collection and judiciary functions. Once the defector reaches government territory, he will be debriefed by Somali intelligence, which can take weeks. 
Redacted debriefs shown to Reuters included details of how al Shabaab welds armor plates inside the cabs of vehicle bombs to prevent soldiers stopping them by shooting the driver. The suicide bomber enters through the roof and tinted windows hide the metal plates. 
Other details included a preference for renting houses with floorboards rather than cement floors so weapons could be hidden; the numbers and makeup of assassination teams; and widespread recriminations among fighters over an Oct. 14 bombing that killed more than 500 civilians in Mogadishu
Nasteh said his main work for Shabaab's Amniyat secret police was spying on leaders to stop them violating rules by skimming money or favoring their clan, and planning assassinations in government territory. 
""You study a person - his home, his work, his associates, his routes. If he's not accessible using a pistol, or a landmine, then you use a car bomb,"" said the slender, softly-spoken young man. 
WHAT NEXT?
The government's push to help defectors in a more organized way began in 2014 after splits in the insurgents prompted top Islamist Hassan Dahir Aweys to come across. He remains under house arrest since he hasn't renounced violence. 
Close behind was Zakariya Ahmed Ismail Hersi, the ex-intelligence chief who once had a $3 million U.S. bounty on his head, and Mohamed Said Atom, the militants' former head in the northern region of Puntland. Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansur came last August. 
Somalia has no law granting amnesty for defections, but there is a cabinet-level policy that all regional states accept.
Many defectors are working alongside the government they once fought. Hersi is deputy head of intelligence at the National Intelligence and Security Agency. Atom was relocated to Qatar. Robow, his militia intact, is exhorting Somalis to fight al Shabaab. All came across after losing favor with al Shabaab. 
""A lot of these guys have got blood on their hands all the way up to the elbows,"" said a Western adviser. ""But they can rise to a very high level (in government)."" 
Harmonie Toros, senior lecturer at the University of Kent, said the government needs a political strategy. 
""The strength is that it (defections) demonstrates to a certain degree that there are senior members of al Shabaab who are not crazy radicals, that we can talk to,"" she said. ""The risk is if you pull all the moderates out, you only leave the ideologues."" 
Scholars and Somalis say the government must show its strength, not just the other side's weakness. That's hard with a tiny budget, constant infighting and massive corruption, but there has been progress. 
A Somali involved in helping defectors said his country's political instability was the biggest challenge, but at least they were helping destabilize the other side. 

""The government and insurgency can both be heading downwards,"" he said, making a dipping motion with his hands. ""But people will still come across if they feel the insurgency is going down faster.""

874,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 02:19AM ET</span>",Militants storm Save the Children aid group office in Afghanistan,"By Rafiq Sherzad and Ahmad Sultan
JALALABAD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Militants stormed an office of the Save the Children aid agency in the Afghan city of Jalalabad on Wednesday and battled security forces who surrounded the building, wounding at least 11 people, officials said.
The attack began with a suicide car bomb outside the office, followed by gunmen entering the compound and battling Afghan special forces, a spokesman for the government in the eastern province said.
""There was a blast and the target was Save the Children,"" said spokesman Attaullah Khogyani. ""Attackers entered the compound and the fight is going on.""
The director of the provincial health department said 11 wounded people had been taken to hospital.
""An explosion rocked the area and right after that children and people started running away,"" said Ghulam Nabi, who was nearby when the bomb exploded. ""I saw a vehicle catch fire and then a gunfight started.""
There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the Taliban, seeking to reimpose Islamic rule after their 2001 ouster, issued a statement denying involvement. 
There are several other aid groups and government offices in the immediate area, and security forces evacuated people from surrounding buildings while they exchanged fire with the militants.
""We are devastated at the news that our Save the Children office in Jalalabad city, Afghanistan, came under attack this morning as armed men entered the building, about 9 a.m. today local time,"" a Save the Children spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
""Our primary concern is for the safety and security of our staff. We are awaiting further information from our team and cannot comment further at this time.""
Jalalabad is the capital of Nangarhar province, on the porous border with Pakistan.
The province has become a stronghold for Islamic State, which has grown to become one of Afghanistan's most dangerous militant groups since it appeared around the beginning of 2015.
Backed by intensive U.S. air strikes, Afghan forces have claimed growing success against the Taliban and other militant groups, including Islamic State, but militant attacks on civilian targets have continued, causing heavy casualties.
The attack in Jalalabad came just days after Taliban militants attacked the Hotel Intercontinental in the capital, Kabul, killing at least 20 people, including 13 foreigners.
The attack underlines how difficult operating in Afghanistan has become for humanitarian aid organizations which have faced heavy pressure from armed groups and kidnappers.

In October, the Red Cross announced that it was drastically reducing its operations in Afghanistan following attacks that killed seven of its staff last year.

875,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 02:00AM ET</span>",Suspected U.S. drone kills two Haqqani network militants in Pakistan,"By Dilawar Hussain and Haji Mujtaba
PARACHINAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - A suspected U.S. drone attack on a house in northwestern Pakistan killed two militants from the Afghan Taliban-allied Haqqani network, two Pakistani security officials said on Wednesday.
Two missiles hit a house and killed militants Ahsan Khorai and Nasir Mehmood in the village of Dapa Mamozai in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), according to a police officer and an intelligence official.
""Two militants from Haqqani network were killed in the drone attack,"" the intelligence official based in the area said.
There has been a slight uptick in U.S. drone strikes inside Pakistan in the mountainous border regions bordering Afghanistan since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, though they are a long way off their peak in 2010.
Earlier this month, one man was severely wounded in a suspected drone attack in FATA, while another Haqqani militant was killed on Dec. 26 in a suspected U.S. drone strike inside Pakistan.
Trump has taken a hardline stance on Pakistan, which he says provides safe haven to high-level commanders from the Haqqani network, a group which often conducts deadly attacks in Afghanistan.
Relations between Washington and Islamabad have frayed over the past month in the wake of Trump's angry tweet on Jan. 1 about Pakistan's ""lies and deceit"" over its alleged support for the Afghan Taliban and their allies. The United States this month also suspended military assistance worth about $2 billion.
Islamabad denies sheltering militants and accuses Washington of not respecting Pakistan's vast sacrifices in the war on militancy.
Over the past decade, almost all U.S. drone strikes inside Pakistan have taken place within FATA, but some Pakistani officials fear the United States under Trump will begin carrying out strikes outside the tribal areas.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis saw Indonesian troops drink snake blood, roll in glass, break bricks with their heads, walk on fire, and more, in a rare military demonstration on Wednesday meant to show the unique skills of Indonesia's military.
Pentagon chiefs are accustomed to seeing foreign forces carry out more routine military demonstrations during foreign travel and, ahead of Wednesday's event, the press traveling with Mattis was expecting a hostage rescue drill.
The ceremony at Indonesia's armed forces headquarters was far more theatrical, however, even featuring a blindfolded soldier shoot out a balloon held between the legs of one of his colleagues. At least one shot missed, although no one appeared injured.
To the sounds of beating drums, the Indonesian soldiers performed a series of gripping martial arts techniques, breaking what appeared to be concrete bricks with their heads. They also smashed stacks of burning blocks with their hands.
Wearing a hood to blind him, one knife-wielding Indonesian soldier slashed away at a cucumber sticking out of his colleague's mouth, coming just inches from striking his nose with the long blade. 
Perhaps the highlight was a demonstration involving live snakes, which Indonesian forces brought out in bags and scattered on the ground, just feet from where Mattis was standing. That included a King Cobra, which widened its neck as it if were going to attack.
The soldiers then cut off the snake heads and fed the snake blood to each other, as the crowd looked on. At least one Indonesian soldier bit a snake in half. 
At the end of the demonstration, to the tune of the movie ""Mission Impossible,"" the Indonesian forces carried out a hostage rescue operation, deploying stealthily from helicopters - with police dogs. The dogs intercepted the gunman.
""As you can see, the dogs bit the terrorist,"" the narrator concluded.
Mattis appeared to enjoy the demonstration, which came at the end of a three-day visit to Indonesia, and spoke about how the Indonesian forces were smart to wear the snakes down before trying to handle them.
""The snakes! Did you see them tire them out and then grab them? The way they were whipping them around – a snake gets tired very quickly,"" he told reporters as he flew to Vietnam.
Indonesian forces are active in jungle conditions and do have to deal with snakes at times. 
The demonstration also showed the intensity of the training of Indonesian forces, Mattis said.

""You could imagine how much training went into each individual there, that they were able to do that,"" he said. ""When you watch a force do that, many small things, perfectly, you can imagine that they can also put the bigger things together.""

Ending near-perpetual civil war has been Suu Kyi's stated top priority, but the Buddhist-majority country has seen the worst fighting with rebels in years since she took office 22 months ago. 
The peace process, which has been eclipsed in world media coverage by the plight of hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya refugees fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh, is key to unlocking the resource-rich country's potential and guaranteeing development for its more than 50 million people. 
New Mon State Party and the Lahu Democratic Union agreed to sign the National Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) after a meeting with Suu Kyi and the military's commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, in the capital, Naypyitaw, on Tuesday, state-run newspaper Global New Light of Myanmar reported.
""I thank our ethnic national brothers and sisters and ethnic Mon and Lahu nationals for helping in the enduring existence of the union, peace in the union and development based on peace,"" Suu Kyi was quoted as saying at a press briefing.
It was not immediately clear when the agreement will be signed. 
The two groups have not engaged in active fighting with the military in recent years, but analysts said it marks a positive move for negotiations with other armed groups. 
At least 10 rebel groups have not joined the NCA, an accord negotiated by the previous quasi-civilian administration. Suu Kyi has opened new round of talks with some of the groups since last May.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner had been criticized overseas for not standing up for the largely stateless Rohingya in the western state of Rakhine, where an army crackdown forced more than 688,000 to flee to Bangladesh since Aug. 25 last year.
The United Nations described Myanmar's crackdown as ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, a charge Myanmar denies.

878,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",Brazil braces for ruling that could bar Lula from 2018 race,"By Lisandra Paraguassu
PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil (Reuters) - An appeals court will decide on Wednesday whether to uphold the corruption conviction of Brazil's most influential politician, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a decision that would likely bar him from running in the presidential race this year.
Tens of thousands of supporters rallied in the streets of Porto Alegre on Tuesday to protest against what they see as the political persecution of the leftist icon, who was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison for accepting a bribe.
Lula, 72, who oversaw a commodities boom a decade ago as Brazil's first working-class president, would be declared ineligible for the Oct. 7 ballot if his appeal is denied as expected. He can still appeal to higher courts to delay a final decision and avoid going to jail.
His exclusion from the election would radically alter the political landscape ahead of a campaign in which Lula is the early favorite, with 36 percent of voter preferences according to pollster Datafolha. That is double the percentage of his nearest rival, the far-right congressman and former army captain Jair Bolsonaro, who has been energized by anti-Lula sentiment.
Lula accused his enemies of trying to oust him from the political arena as they had by impeaching his handpicked successor Dilma Rousseff in 2016, ending 13 years of Workers Party rule.
""I know I committed no crime,"" he told supporters at a rally in downtown Porto Alegre on Tuesday evening. ""They fear a Lula comeback in 2018. They fear the good things we achieved.""
Preparing for trouble, the city deployed several thousand police and mounted a four-block security perimeter around the appeals court to prevent any disruption of Wednesday's session.
Lula was convicted of corruption and money laundering last year for accepting a beachside apartment from an engineering firm vying for contracts with state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA.
Prosecutors said the apartment and its refurbishing was a bribe worth 3.7 million reais ($1.1 million). Lula maintains he never owned the penthouse apartment, criticizing prosecutors for leaning on the plea bargain testimony of one witness.
The case has polarized Brazil, with Lula's critics calling for him to be put behind bars and his Workers Party allies calling on supporters to resist any attempt to arrest him.
Lula left office in 2010 with an unprecedented 87 percent approval rating, boosted by social programs that lifted millions of Brazilians from poverty. His reputation has been tarnished by corruption scandals, but most political analysts agree he would still make it to a second-round run-off if allowed in the race.
Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index has risen around 10 percent in the past month on the prospect of Lula being barred from the election.
That would increase the chances of a more business-friendly politician taking office in 2019 and continuing the reforms and fiscal austerity efforts of President Michel Temer, including his attempt to overhaul Brazil's costly pension system.
However, a protracted appeals process could allow Lula to remain on the ballot, which would fuel political volatility that may delay approval of pension reform and weigh on Brazilian financial markets.
""The next president could take office on Jan. 1 against a backdrop of further credit ratings downgrades and a negative economic outlook,"" said Jimena Blanco, head of Latin America risk analysis at Verisk Maplecroft.
Blanco expects a positive market reaction if Lula's conviction is upheld, though any upside for the real and the Bovespa stock index will be limited, she said by email.

Arriving in Switzerland for the Davos business summit this week, Temer said Lula's trial was ""normal"" and showed Brazil's institutions were working properly.

879,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 12:17AM ET</span>",EU ambassador says he expects release of Swedish citizen detained by China,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The European Union's Ambassador to China said on Wednesday he expects Chinese authorities to immediately release Swedish citizen and Hong Kong-based bookseller Gui Minhai, echoing demands from Stockholm.
Sweden confirmed on Tuesday that Gui, who has published books on the personal lives of Chinese Communist Party leaders, was taken into custody at the weekend while traveling with Swedish diplomats to seek medical treatment in Beijing.
EU Ambassador to China Hans Dietmar Schweisgut told reporters at a briefing that the EU ""fully supports"" Sweden's efforts to resolve the issue with China.
""We expect the Chinese authorities to immediately release Gui Minhai from detention and to allow him to reunite with his family, to get consulate support and medical support in line with his rights, because he is a Swedish citizen and also a citizen of the European Union,"" Schweisgut said.
Gui was abducted in Thailand while on holiday in 2015, one of five Hong Kong booksellers who went missing that year and later appeared in custody on mainland China. The four others have returned to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities said Gui was freed in October after serving a two-year sentence for a traffic offense in 2003.
Sweden's Foreign Ministry said in an earlier statement that, before Gui's latest detention, it had been ""repeatedly assured"" by Chinese authorities that Gui was a free man and that it could ""have any contact"" with him.
It has said it expects China to release Gui so that he can meet diplomatic and medical staff, and has also twice summoned China's ambassador to Stockholm to explanation the situation.
China's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday it had no specific information on Gui, who his daughter Angela says was taken off a train by plainclothes police while en route to the capital to get medical attention for a neurological ailment.
Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said then that Sweden and China enjoy good communication and ""if there are any problems ..., (we) can conduct timely and effective dialogue. This is no problem at all"".

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro looked sure to stand for re-election in a presidential vote due by the end of April where the ruling Socialists hope to trump a squabbling opposition despite an economic crisis and foreign sanctions.
The unpopular leader, whom foes decry as a dictator who has wrecked the OPEC member's economy, said he would run if the ruling Socialist Party asked him, even as Venezuelans reel from empty shelves and the world's fastest inflation.
""I'm ready to be a candidate,"" he told reporters during a rally on Tuesday of cheering red-shirted supporters.
The 55-year-old former bus driver and union leader, who succeeded Hugo Chavez in 2013, benefits from a formidable political machinery, a compliant national election board, and a core of support from poor Venezuelans reliant on food handouts.
Critics from opposition politicians to Western powers doubt authorities will allow a free and fair vote, given the barring of some opposition figures from running plus abuse of state resources in campaigning.
Some fear outright fraud.
""These are not elections, it's a military occupation with a fraudulent election board,"" said hardline opposition activist Maria Corina Machado, referring to the armed forces' major role in government and the board's past pro-Maduro stance.
Announcing the presidential poll would be held by the end of April, the pro-government Constituent Assembly superbody legislature said another election in Venezuela was further evidence of its democratic credentials despite a recent raft of international sanctions.
The United States, Canada, and the European Union have all taken measures against Venezuela's government over rights and corruption allegations, hurting the government's image and spooking banks from working with Caracas.
Maduro blasted the European Union for imposing ""grotesque"" sanctions this week on seven senior Venezuelan officials, including a travel ban and an asset freeze, and took aim at Spain's conservative prime minister.
""Mariano Rajoy, get on all fours, my friend, because the people are going to slap you,"" Maduro said, flanked by cabinet members and wife Cilia Flores, whom he refers to as the ""First Combatant.""
Should the presidential vote be perceived as fraudulent, further foreign sanctions could come, including from U.S. President Donald Trump who has made opposition to Maduro a prominent feature of his foreign policy.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Tuesday she did not think it would be a good idea for Maduro to run for re-election. And a 14-member regional group that includes Canada, Mexico and Peru said an election held under the present conditions would lack legitimacy.
""We demand that presidential elections be held with adequate lead time,"" the so-called Lima Group said in a joint statement, adding that all political actors and independent international observers must be allowed to take part.
Mexico pulled out of mediating government-opposition talks in the Dominican Republic, saying the sudden announcement of a presidential poll without guarantees was incompatible with the negotiations.
WHO WILL TAKE ON MADURO? 
It is unclear whom the Democratic Unity opposition coalition would attempt to field. The opposition plans to hold primaries to choose a candidate, but the hasty presidential vote may make that tricky.
Its most popular leaders are almost all sidelined from politics - jailed, in exile, or barred from holding office. Months of protests last year failed to dislodge Maduro but resulted in at least 125 deaths.
""The majority of Venezuelans loathe his government and his circle. If our people are allowed to decide, they are out!"" one opposition leader, Henrique Capriles, said.
Capriles, a two-time presidential candidate, is prohibited from holding office over allegations of ""administrative irregularities"". Former mayor Leopoldo Lopez is under house arrest for leading protests against Maduro, while his young protege Freddy Guevara has taken refuge in the Chilean embassy to avoid charges of plotting against Maduro.
The opposition could succumb to in-fighting about what conditions to accept in the vote.
During the governors' election of last October, opposition candidates for the first time gave convincing evidence that elections authorities had altered results in one state, though Maduro scoffed at that and said the system was the cleanest in the world.

With cynicism toward all politicians running high among Venezuelans, many are clamoring for a nontraditional, outside candidate. The name of Lorenzo Mendoza, billionaire head of private food company Polar, is on many people's lips, but he has given no indication of wanting to stand.

ZURICH/DAVOS (Reuters) - Anti-capitalists marched through Swiss cities on Tuesday to protest a planned visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to the World Economic Forum (WEF) and broke through a security cordon in Davos.
Leftists organizers called for the protests under the mottos ""Trump Not Welcome"" and ""Smash WEF!"" 
Trump is due to speak on Friday at the WEF in the Alpine town of Davos, an annual meeting of global business and political leaders where protests have been banned.
About 20 demonstrators broke through security to reach the Davos Congress Centre, holding banners and shouting ""Wipe out WEF"" before they were peacefully disbanded by police.
""Trump is just one of the other people we disagree with. We've been protesting every year now against the World Economic Forum and if Trump comes or not we don't care. Trump is just, maybe he's just the best symbol of this world,"" protester Alex Hedinger told Reuters TV in Davos.
More than 4,000 Swiss soldiers have deployed to guard Davos alongside 1,000 police and a no-fly zone is in place.
Police estimated that there were 2,000 demonstrators in Zurich.
They carried flags and anti-globalist and environmentalist placards such as ""No Trump, no coal, no gas, no fossil fuels"" as they marched toward Zurich's financial district, where bankers had been warned to stay clear of the approved demonstration. 
Swiss television RSR showed a sign that read ""Who was the shithole?"", in reference to reported remarks by Trump about Haiti and African countries, which he has denied.
Several hundred protesters also marched in public squares in Geneva, Lausanne and Fribourg. Geneva signs read ""World Economic Fiasco"", ""racist sexist capitalist"" and ""Don't touch women's rights"".
Geneva demonstrator organizer Paolo Gilardi told Reuters TV: ""While the Swiss Federal Council (Swiss cabinet) is about to welcome and unroll the red carpet for Mister Trump, well we think that the population has something to say.""
""This policy is unacceptable because the goal ... is to reduce the planet to fire and blood and to assure the powerful people's domination over the rest of the world.""
Earlier in Geneva, protesters laid a wreath at the entrance of the U.S. diplomatic mission in memory of Heather Heyer, who was killed in Charlottesville, Virginia, amid clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters last August.
After the rally, Trump inflamed tensions by saying there were ""very fine people"" on both sides, drawing condemnation from some Republican leaders and praise from white supremacists.
Earlier this month, demonstrators also protested against Trump's visit in the Swiss capital of Bern.

That march was peaceful, unlike violent anti-WEF protests in several Swiss cities in the early 2000s.

BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - A double car bombing in the east Libyan city of Benghazi on Tuesday left at least 33 people dead and dozens more wounded, including senior security figures and civilians, officials said.
The twin explosions shattered the relative calm that had recently returned to Libya's second city, scene of more than three years of warfare from 2014 until late last year.
The first blast struck outside a mosque in Benghazi's central Al Salmani district as worshippers were leaving evening prayers.
Some 10 to 15 minutes later, after security and health officials had arrived on the scene, a second, more powerful blast was detonated from a Mercedes parked on the opposite side of the street, hitting an ambulance and causing a higher number of casualties.
One of those killed was Ahmed al-Feitouri of the investigation and arrest unit attached to the general command of east Libyan security forces. A senior intelligence official, Mahdi al-Fellah, was among around 50 wounded, officials said.
The victims also included civilians, among them an Egyptian national employed in a vegetable shop in front of the mosque. Health officials said the toll could rise because some of the wounded were in critical condition. 
It was not immediately clear who was responsible.
Forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar prevailed in Benghazi's conflict after protracted urban battles against Islamists and other opponents that left parts of the port city in ruins.
There were several bombings during the latter stages of the conflict targeting figures linked to Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), but Tuesday's casualty toll was far higher than usual.
The LNA claimed victory in Benghazi in July, but sporadic clashes dragged on until last month, when it took control of its rivals' final holdout.
It has imposed strict military controls on Benghazi and other parts of eastern Libya. 
The fighting in Benghazi was part of a broader conflict that developed in Libya after former ruler Muammar Gaddafi was removed from power and killed in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011.
The North African nation has had competing governments aligned with rival military factions based in Tripoli and the east since 2014.
The eastern government, which is aligned with Haftar's LNA and opposes an internationally backed government in the capital, declared three days of mourning after Tuesday's attack.

On a two-day visit to Lebanon, the U.S. Treasury's Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing Marshall Billingslea ""urged Lebanon to take every possible measure to ensure (Hezbollah) is not part of the financial sector"".
Billingslea also ""stressed the importance of countering Iranian malign activity in Lebanon,"" a statement from the United States embassy in Lebanon said.
The Iran-backed, Shi'ite Hezbollah is classified as a terrorist group by Washington, but sits in Lebanon's delicate national unity government.
U.S. officials say Hezbollah is funded not just by Iran but by global networks of people, businesses and money laundering operations.
The U.S. Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Acts of 2015 and 2017 aimed to sever the group's funding routes and a number of people linked to Hezbollah are on sanctions lists. 
The United States has had to balance its targeting of Hezbollah funding routes with the need to maintain Lebanon's stability. Lebanese banking and political authorities have lobbied Washington to make sure its anti-Hezbollah measures do not destroy the banking system underpinning the economy.
In his meetings with President Michel Aoun, Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri and other banking and political figures, Billingslea said the U.S. government was committed to work with Lebanon to protect its financial system and support a ""strong, stable, and prosperous Lebanon"".
Billingslea also said Washington would help Lebanon protect its financial system from Islamic State and other militants.
Two weeks ago, the Trump administration set up a team to reinvigorate U.S. investigations into Hezbollah-linked drug trafficking. 
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah last week denied any involvement in drug trafficking and said Hezbollah had a very clear religious and moral stance which forbids drugs and drug trading.

ABOARD AIR FORCE TWO (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence plans to use his attendance at the Winter Olympics in South Korea next month to try to counter what he sees as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s effort to “hijack” the games with a propaganda campaign, a White House official said on Tuesday.
Pence will be present at the games not just for ceremonial purposes but to try to offset the “charade” he expects the North Koreans to put on when they send a team and also march in the opening ceremony with their South Korean counterparts, according to the official traveling with the vice president and speaking on condition of anonymity.
“He has grave concerns that Kim will hijack the messaging around the Olympics,” the official told reporters aboard Pence’s plane as he returned to the United States from a trip to the Middle East. “The North Koreans have been master manipulators in the past. It’s a murderous state.” 
Pence will conduct media interviews during his visit to South Korea, the official said.
“He’s going to root on our Olympians, and he’s excited about that. He’s going to ensure that from a messaging standpoint that it isn’t turned into two weeks of propaganda,"" the official said.
The South Korean government earlier on Tuesday rejected criticism that the games had been hijacked by North Korea, saying the event will help defuse tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile program.
Following recent North-South talks that led to an agreement for North Korea to send a delegation to the Olympics, some opposition politicians and conservatives have criticized Pyongyang’s participation in the games in the South Korean alpine resort town of Pyeongchang.
U.S. President Donald Trump and top advisers have publicly welcomed the recent talks between the Koreas, but U.S. officials have said privately that Pyongyang might be trying to drive a wedge between allies Washington and Seoul.

Tensions between North Korea and the United States have run high over Pyongyang’s efforts to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States.

BENTON, Ky. (Reuters) - A 15-year-old boy opened fire with a handgun inside his high school in rural western Kentucky on Tuesday, killing two fellow students and wounding a dozen other youths before he was arrested, the state's governor and police said.
The shooting began shortly before 8 a.m. CST at Marshall County High School in Benton, a small farming town about 130 miles (210 km) northwest of Nashville, Tennessee, according to Kentucky State Police and Governor Matt Bevin.
Authorities declined to discuss possible motives for the shooting. There was no immediate indication of how well the suspect knew the victims, but officials said he was believed to have acted alone and faces multiple charges of murder and attempted murder.
""There's no good answer for it,"" Bevin told reporters at a news conference. ""There's 1,000 hypotheses we're not going to go into.""
The bloodshed at the school, where nearly 1,150 students are enrolled, was the latest outbreak of gun violence that has become a regular occurrence at schools and college campuses across the United States over the past several years.
Tuesday's rampage occurred just 32 miles (52 km) from Heath High School in West Paducah, Kentucky, where in 1997 a 14-year-old boy opened fire on a group of students, killing three.
At Marshall County High, 14 students were hit by gunfire, two of them fatally, officials said. A 15-year-old girl was pronounced dead at the scene, and a 15-year-old boy died at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center's trauma unit in Nashville, Bevin and hospital officials said.
Four of the other gunshot patients brought to Vanderbilt were expected to survive, doctors said. Less severely wounded students were taken to other hospital in the area. Another five students suffered non-gunshot injuries, Bevin said, bringing the total number of injured to 17.
The 15-year-old suspect walked into the school armed with a handgun and started shooting, Kentucky State Police Commissioner Richard Sanders said at the news conference. Bevin said the youth was apprehended at the school ""in a nonviolent"" manner, but the governor did not elaborate.
Sanders said students followed training they had recently received from state police in how to respond to such incidents.
No further details of the circumstances of the shooting were immediately released by authorities. None of the students involved were being publicly identified, Bevin said.
Agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Federal Bureau of Investigation joined in the investigation, officials said at the news conference.
The school serves Marshall County, which has population of about 31,000.
During the news conference at the county Board of Education, Bevin paused to collect himself as his voice choked with emotion, asking members of the news media to exercise restraint in dealing with the families of victims.
“I beg of you again - respect the fact that these children belong to this community and to specific families in this community. And this is a wound that is going take a long time to heal. And for some in this community it will never fully heal.”

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said President Donald Trump had been briefed on the shooting, adding, ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the families there.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia proposed on Tuesday that the U.N. Security Council create a new inquiry into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, a move the United States slammed as a bid to distract from a French initiative to target perpetrators of such strikes.
Earlier on Tuesday in Paris dozens of countries agreed to work to preserve evidence and impose sanctions on those responsible after Russia ended in November an international inquiry into chemical weapons attacks in Syria.
At a meeting of the 15-member U.N. Security Council requested by Moscow following the Paris meeting, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia circulated a draft resolution to create a new international investigative body to replace the previous U.N.-mandated inquiry, which he said was a ""complete failure.""
Nebenzia said the inquiry would use ""irreproachable and corroborated information received from transparent and credible sources ... to establish evidence for the Security Council to identify perpetrators in the use of chemical weapons."" He did not say if or when the council could vote on such a move. 
A previous joint inquiry of the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) had found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin in an April 4, 2017 attack and has also several times used chlorine as a weapon. It blamed Islamic State militants for mustard gas use.
But the inquiry ended in November after Russia blocked for the third time in a month attempts at the Security Council to renew the inquiry, which Moscow slammed as flawed.
""When Russia doesn't like the facts, they try and distract the conversation. That's because the facts come back over and over again to the truth Russia wants to hide - that the Assad regime continues to use chemical weapons against its own people,"" U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley told the Security Council.
""The United States and the international community are not going to be fooled. We remain steadfast in pursuing accountability for those who use chemical weapons,"" she said. 
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government denies using chemical weapons, which it agreed to destroy in 2013 under an agreement brokered by Russia and the United States.
The United Nations and Paris meetings came a day after rescue workers in a Syrian rebel-held enclave east of Damascus accused government forces of using chlorine gas during bombardment of the area on Monday.

The latest strikes come as the United States urged Turkey to show restraint in its campaign against Kurdish forces in northern Syria and to focus on fighting Islamic State militants.
The United States has signaled an open-ended military presence in Syria as part of a broader strategy to prevent Islamic State’s resurgence, pave the way diplomatically for the eventual departure of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and curtail Iran’s influence.
""The precision strikes were a culmination of extensive intelligence preparation to confirm an ISIS headquarters and command and control center in an exclusively ISIS-occupied location in the contested middle Euphrates River Valley,"" a statement issued on Tuesday said, using an acronym for Islamic State.
The strikes took place near As Shafah, Syria and killed between 145 and 150 militants. The statement added that U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes Kurdish YPG fighters, helped in target observation.
Turkey seeks to avoid any clash with U.S., Russian or Syrian forces but will take any steps needed for its security, a Turkish minister said on Tuesday, the fourth day of its air and ground offensive against Kurdish forces.
The United States and Russia both have military forces in Syria and have urged Turkey to show restraint in its campaign, named Operation Olive Branch, to crush the U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG in the Afrin region on Turkey's southern border.
""Our SDF partners are still making daily progress and sacrifices, and together we are still finding, targeting and killing ISIS terrorists intent on keeping their extremist hold on the region,"" Major General James Jarrard, commander of special operations for the coalition, said in the statement.
The United States has led an international coalition conducting air strikes against Islamic State since 2014. U.S. troops have served as advisers on the ground with Iraqi government forces and with Kurdish and Arab groups in Syria.
The coalition has said in the past that fewer than 1,000 Islamic State fighters remain in Iraq and Syria, but that the militant group still remains a threat. The figure excludes areas in western Syria under the control of Assad’s government and his allies.

Fabricio Alvarado, a 43-year-old journalist and the only lawmaker from the evangelical National Restoration party, led the survey by the Center for Research and Political Studies (CIEP) at the University of Costa Rica with 17 percent support.
Given the margin of error, he was virtually tied with conservative lawyer Juan Diego Castro, who had the backing of 16 percent of respondents ahead of the Feb. 4 vote.
Coffee-producing Costa Rica, one of the more prosperous and stable countries in Central America, had been ruled by a two-party dynasty until an upset in the 2014 vote that brought to power a center-left academic who had never held elected office. 
Antonio Alvarez Desanti, from the traditionally powerful National Liberation Party (PLN), dropped to third with 11 percent support, according to the CIEP study. The poll was based on 1,013 telephone interviews carried out from Jan. 15 to 17 and had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.
Some 27 percent of voters were undecided and all 13 candidates were far from the 40 percent minimum needed to win outright in the first round.
Without an outright winner, the two best-placed candidates would head to a runoff in early April.
Castro, who served as security minister in the 1990s, led during the first months of the campaign by promising to tackle corruption and crime. He is running for the small National Integration Party (PIN).
But Alvarado's opposition to a January ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which called for the legalization of same-sex marriage, helped him to climb 14 percentage points in one month, according to the survey.
Under Costa Rican law, incumbent President Luis Guillermo Solis cannot seek immediate re-election.
Carlos Alvarado, the candidate from Solis' Citizens' Action Party (PAC), had only 6 percent support amid allegations of corruption against the Solis administration.

Yemen has been torn apart by nearly three years of conflict, which pits the internationally-recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi against the Iran-aligned Houthis who control most of the populous northern Yemen. Hadi's forces and their allies control vast areas in south and eastern Yemen.
Residents said an aircraft struck a vehicle traveling in the Aal Ali region of Razeh district in western Saada province, an area of confrontation between government forces loyal to Hadi and the Houthis. 
Apart from those killed, three people were wounded, including two who were being treated at a local hospital, medics said.
""We take this report very seriously and it will be fully investigated as all reports of this nature are,"" a spokesman for the coalition said. ""Whilst this is ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further.""
Though little territory has changed hands between the two sides since war erupted in 2015, it has caused a major humanitarian crisis in which more than 10,000 have been killed, according to U.N. data.
It has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine and led to a cholera epidemic believed to have affected about one million people.
On Monday, coalition air strikes destroyed a building near the Saada provincial capital that housed a small clinic, killing seven people, including five children, while two more people died in a separate attack, also near Saada city.
The Western-backed coalition has come under criticism from the United Nations and international rights groups over repeated air strikes that hit civilians.
The coalition says it directs strikes only at military targets.
In southwestern Yemen, rockets fired by the Houthis on Monday at a parade of Yemeni government special security forces killed 12 people, including two journalists. The deputy interior minister, who was attending the parade, escaped unharmed.

Former military chief of staff Lieutenant General Sami Anan, who had announced his candidacy last week, was taken to the Military Prosecutor's office in Cairo, according to his son and one of his lawyers, who were waiting outside the building.
Anan's son Samir Anan said late on Tuesday they had not heard from his father since his detention and did not know whether he was still at the Military Prosecutor's office or had been moved elsewhere.
An army statement read on state TV said Anan's presidential bid amounted to ""a serious breach of the laws of military service"", because as a military officer he was required to end his service and seek permission before seeking office.
Anan's spokesman denied he had broken any laws. The charges ""come from an inaccurate reading of Anan's announcement,"" Hazem Hosni told Reuters, without elaborating. The campaign announced Anan was halting his bid.
""To be banned by the state to enter the elections ... (means) that the state doesn't want to hold an election,"" Hosni said.
The military declined to comment on Anan's detention. The interior ministry could not immediately be reached for comment.
The Military Prosecution later issued a statement banning media coverage of its investigation into Anan.
A witness who knows Anan told Reuters the candidate was detained while driving to his office shortly before the army statement was broadcast. His car was stopped by what appeared to be armed military police on a main road in Cairo.
Anan, who served as armed forces chief of staff from 2005-2012, was the final high profile challenger to Sisi left in the race after a number of others dropped out, some citing intimidation by the authorities.
""He was the longest-serving chief of staff but that didn't stop them arresting him,"" Anan's office director Mustafa al-Shal said outside the Military Prosecutor's office.
Egypt's president's office and government press center have not commented on the election race. The electoral commission has said it will ensure the vote is fair and transparent.
Sisi, who as military chief led the overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013 and was elected president the following year, announced last week he will seek a second term in the election set for late March.
CANDIDATES WITHDRAW
Ahmed Shafik, a former prime minister and air force chief, abandoned a bid this month, saying that after several years living abroad he was out of touch with Egyptian politics. The announcement came amid media criticism and speculation that he was being held by authorities in a Cairo hotel.
Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat, the nephew of assassinated President Anwar al-Sadat, said last week he would not run, citing an environment of fear surrounding the vote.
Rights lawyer Khaled Ali has said he will still run, but he might be disqualified over a legal case against him.
Anan announced his presidential bid in a video declaration posted on his official Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page last week, saying he was running to save Egypt from incorrect policies and calling on state institutions to maintain neutrality toward all candidates.
Egyptian law requires former army officials to end their service and receive permission from the military before they can run for political office. The army's statement said Anan had falsified documents that stated his military service had ended.
Sisi's critics say his popularity has eroded over tough economic reforms tied to a $12 billion International Monetary Fund loan, which have squeezed many Egyptians, and over a crackdown on dissidents.
His supporters say firm measures are necessary to bring security and stability to a country that has seen unrest since a 2011 uprising toppled long-serving autocrat Hosni Mubarak.

Egypt is fighting a stubborn Islamic State insurgency in its North Sinai region. Militants have expanded their attacks to target civilians, especially over the past year.

The formal visit will include a state dinner hosted by Trump and his wife, Melania.
Trump and Macron have developed a friendly relationship over the past year, though it got off to an unusual start. The two leaders gripped hands so tightly during their first meeting that their knuckles turned white.
They also have struggled to find common ground on two major international issues: the 2015 Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal.

But in a July visit to Paris, Trump was delighted by a military parade to mark France's annual Bastille Day holiday and the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry into World War One, and has said Macron is ""doing a terrific job in France.""

896,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>","Pakistan arrests serial killer suspect over rape, murder of girl, 7","By Mubasher Bukhari
LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Police in Pakistan said on Tuesday they had arrested a man suspected to be a serial killer responsible for the rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl, a case that ignited nationwide protests over allegations of government inaction. 
Police found Zainab Ansari's body in a garbage dumpster in Kasur district near the eastern city of Lahore last week, four days after she was reported missing. Residents of the area have said the murder was the 12th such incident in a year, setting off fears of a serial rapist killer on the loose.
Shahbaz Sharif, chief minister of Punjab province, where Kasur is located, said the arrested man had confessed to Zainab's murder and his DNA matched samples found on her body. 
Sharif, addressing the media, identified Imran Ali, 24, of Kasur, as the killer of Zainab. 
Regional police officer Zulfiqar Hameed told Reuters the suspect was one of Zainab's neighbors. CCTV footage of the day she was abducted showed her walking off calmly with a man identified as her kidnapper. 
A police official who asked not to be named said the accused had confessed to multiple murders and that he was suspected of raping and killing at least seven girls. 
He added that Ali was arrested on Wednesday but police waited to match DNA evidence before making an announcement. 
Sharif said in his statement that 1,150 DNA samples were collected and matched with samples taken from Zainab's body. 
Two people were killed in Kasur the day after Zainab's body was recovered when police fired at hundreds of angry protesters, who said negligence on the part of the authorities was behind the repeated killings.
A number of police officials have been transferred out of Punjab for failing to investigate complaints of missing children since 2015, when authorities uncovered what they said was a pedophile ring linked to a prominent local family.
At least two people have been convicted in connection with that case, in which authorities say hundreds of children in the district were abused.
A total of 1,764 cases of child abuse were reported across Pakistan in the first six months of 2017, according to Sahil, an organization that works on child protection.
In 2016, the total number of reported child abuse cases was 4,139, or around 11 new cases reported per day. 
Zainab's case has emotions running high in Pakistan and the normally taboo subject of child abuse being discussed widely on local television.

""I want Imran Ali to be hanged publicly ... I will request the political parties to support my wish,"" Sharif said.

Mnangagwa, 75, took power after Robert Mugabe was toppled by the military. He immediately promised to tackle corruption, especially in public institutions.
Misheck Sibanda, chief secretary to the president and cabinet, said in a statement that it was now mandatory for cabinet ministers, their deputies, senior government officials and bosses of state-owned businesses to declare their assets.
The officials will be required to disclose details on their real estate, other property valued above $100,000, and shareholdings in businesses by February 28.
""The president expects the full and urgent cooperation of all the affected office bearers,"" Sibanda said.
Mnangagwa, who is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, the first time by a Zimbabwean president, is trying to break with past policies of Mugabe in a bid to lure foreign investment and end the country's international pariah status.
Under Mugabe's near four-decade rule, few government officials were arrested for corruption.
When the military announced it had put Mugabe under house arrest on Nov. 15, it said it was targeting criminals that surrounded the 93-year-old leader.

Since then, three former government ministers and allies of Mugabe have been arrested and charged in court for criminal abuse of office. The trio denies the charges and say they are being persecuted for supporting Mugabe and his wife Grace.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected bids by two states to reinstate a ban on the disputed Bollywood film ""Padmaavat"", saying it stood by its previous ruling clearing the way for the movie to be shown in theaters.
Street protests against the film turned increasingly violent late on Tuesday with reports of vandalism around a number of multiplexes in the western state of Gujarat. 
Groups critical of the project have accused its director, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, of distorting history by portraying a Muslim ruler as the ""lover"" of Queen Padmavati of the Hindu Rajput warrior clan. The filmmakers deny the accusation.
A fire department official said protesters had burnt dozens of two-wheelers and smashed a number of car and shop windows in Ahmedabad, Gujarat on Tuesday night.
Ahmedabad Police Commissioner A.K.Singh said the violence occurred around four shopping malls that house multiplexes. He said hundreds of youth were involved. 
""We had to open fire to stop the mob from smashing vehicles,"" Singh told Reuters, adding no one was injured in the shooting. ""We are upgrading security near these malls."" 
The government of the northwestern state of Rajasthan had argued it wanted to avoid public unrest by banning the film. On Monday Rajasthan and the central state of Madhya Pradesh, both run by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), asked the court to reconsider its earlier ruling.
""We are not going to modify our earlier order,"" the three-judge bench of the Apex Court, headed by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra said on Tuesday. ""States must ensure that law and order must prevail.""
The film, due for release on Thursday ahead of the long Republic Day weekend, has opened for advance bookings elsewhere in India, but theaters in the two states have yet to list it.
The court issued its initial ruling last week at the behest of the film's producers after four states, including Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, sought to prohibit the film, despite clearance by a film certification panel.
Despite the court ruling, theater owners in the two states, which are among India's biggest film markets, said they were wary of releasing the film without more explicit support from their state governments.
""We want to release the film, but have no support from the government. When we approached the local police, we were told that we should show the film at our own risk,"" Sandeep Jain, who owns seven theaters in Madhya Pradesh, told Reuters.
The top administrative officer in the district of Gurgaon, 30 km (19 miles) from capital New Delhi, imposed a ban on carrying firearms or other articles capable of causing injury, raising slogans and exhibiting placards within 200 meters of cinema halls and multiplexes from Jan. 23-28.
Conservative Hindu groups, such as the Shri Rajput Karni Sena, held protests this week against the film's release, including blocking traffic in parts of the country.
A Rajput community group, Sarwa Kshatriya Mahasabha, in the central state of Chhattisgarh said they would continue their protests despite the court's order. 

""We have already warned the cinema hall owners and they have given in writing that they will not screen the film. In case they do, we will not be responsible for any consequences,"" Rakesh Singh Bais told Reuters.

Authorities said on Monday that at least seven people died in clashes between security forces and worshippers taking part in a religious ceremony marking Epiphany in Amhara region in northern Ethiopia at the weekend, but they had yet to determine the cause of the violence.
Shamdasani told a U.N. briefing in Geneva that the U.N. human rights office was extremely concerned by the deaths.
""The incident, in Woldiya City in Amhara Regional State on 20 January, reportedly took place when the security forces tried to stop people from chanting anti-government songs and allegedly opened fire on them. Protesters reportedly later blocked roads and destroyed a number of properties.""
Ethiopian government spokesman Negeri Lencho, reacting to Shamdasani's statement, told journalists on Tuesday that demands by the public should be ""raised peacefully."" Security forces should exercise restraint and avoid actions that could lead to death and injury, he said.
Shamdasani did not specify the source of the information but said the U.N.'s regional office in Addis Ababa had collected information from several sources, including local media, trusted civil society sources and official statements. 
The incident was all the more regrettable as it came just two weeks after Ethiopia's ruling coalition, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front, announced its intention of undertaking reforms, she added. 
""We understand that the President of Amhara Regional State, who confirmed that there had been deaths and injuries, said there would be what he termed a 'careful examination' of the incident.""
She said it should be prompt, independent, impartial and effective and ensure anybody responsible for violating human rights was held accountable.

PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Tuesday the Syrian government may still be using chemical weapons against its own people following a suspected chlorine attack in a rebel enclave, and he said Russia bore ultimate responsibility.
Rescue workers in the rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta, near to Damascus, accused government forces of using chlorine gas during bombardment of the area on Monday. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 13 people had suffered suffocation in the incident.
President Bashar al-Assad's government denies using chemical weapons, which it agreed to destroy in 2013 under an agreement brokered by Russia and the United States.
""Only yesterday more than 20 civilians, mostly children, were victims of an apparent chlorine gas attack,"" Tillerson said after attending a conference on chemical weapons in Paris.
""The recent attacks in Eastern Ghouta raise serious concerns that Bashar al-Assad may be continuing to use chemical weapons against his own people.""
Eastern Ghouta is the last major rebel-held zone near Damascus and where at least 390,000 civilians have been besieged for four years.
""Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in Eastern Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria,"" said Tillerson.
RUSSIA ""BREACHED ITS COMMITMENTS""
Russia is a close ally of Assad, providing direct military support in Syria against the various rebel groups trying to oust him and also diplomatic cover in the U.N. Security Council.
Tillerson was speaking during a meeting hosted by France on an initiative to target those responsible for chemical attacks, largely in Syria, after an international investigation into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria ended in November after Russian opposition.
A joint inquiry of the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) determined that the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin in an April 4, 2017, attack and also used several times chlorine as a weapon.
""Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution of the overall crisis,"" Tillerson said, adding there was mounting evidence since April 2014 that Syria still had chemical weapons.
""There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor,"" he added. 
At the Paris meeting 24 countries agreed to work more closely on targeting those behind chemical weapons attacks and imposing necessary sanctions on them.
As a first step, France on Tuesday imposed unilateral sanctions on 25 people and entities, including from China, Lebanon and France, and among them importers and distributors of metals, electronics and lighting systems. It said the companies were helping to supply Syria's chemical weapons programme.

""The current situation cannot continue,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. ""The criminals who have used and designed these barbaric weapons must know that they will not go unpunished.""

ROME (Reuters) - The leader of Italy's far-right Northern League on Tuesday called the euro ""a failed experiment"" and presented outspoken anti-euro economists among his election candidates, widening divisions with his ally Silvio Berlusconi.
The four-times prime minister Berlusconi is presenting himself as a moderate, pro-European figure ahead of the March 4 vote, and on Monday he met EU leaders in Brussels where he promised Italy would keep its budget deficit inside EU limits.
The two parties signed a joint program last week pledging an ""end to austerity"" and promising a ""revision of EU treaties"" but making no reference to leaving the euro.
But League leader Matteo Salvini on Tuesday ramped up his euroskeptic rhetoric, calling the euro ""a failed experiment that has hurt Italy's economy"". He added: ""A country that does not control its currency is not a free country.""
Salvini also took issue with Berlusconi's pledge to hold the deficit below 3 percent of national output.
""If that 3 percent damages Italian families, as far as we are concerned it doesn't exist,"" he said.
Salvini was presenting the election candidacies of Claudio Borghi and Alberto Bagnai, two of Italy's most euroskeptic economists, who both advocate an end to budget restraint and a break-up of the currency bloc.
Presenting his party as the only alternative for voters fed up with the euro, Salvini attacked the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which has backtracked on a plan for a referendum on the euro, for ""changing its position 360 degrees"". 
Borghi, who is the League's economic spokesman but does not yet sit in parliament, has drawn up a plan to issue small denomination, interest-free bonds to firms and individuals owed money by the state as payment for services or as tax rebates.
He has said he sees the scheme, which was adopted as part of the center-right's election program, as a form of parallel currency which will prepare Italy for an eventual euro exit.
Borghi will compete in the Tuscan city of Siena against the current Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, an orthodox, pro-euro economist running for the ruling Democratic Party.
The uneasy conservative alliance, which also includes the extreme-right Brothers of Italy, is polling at around 37 percent, meaning it would win most seats in parliament but probably be unable to form a government.

Berlusconi and Salvini have agreed that whichever party gets most votes will pick the bloc's candidate for prime minister. Forza Italia is polling about four points ahead of the League, but Berlusconi cannot run himself because of a 2013 tax fraud conviction.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German anti-euro party Alternative for Germany (AfD) is set to chair parliament's key budget committee if talks succeed to renew a ""grand coalition"" of conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD), according to a document seen by Reuters.
The AfD, which stormed into parliament for the first time in September, will become the largest opposition party in the lower house, the Bundestag, if conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel forms a government with the SPD.
A blueprint agreed among the Bundestag party factions on how to share out the various committees showed that, if that happened, they would respect the tradition that allows the main opposition party to head the budget committee, which vets euro zone bailouts.
The AfD, which wants Germany to leave the euro zone, was also set to chair the law and consumer protection committee and the tourism committee.
Merkel's conservatives, the SPD, the Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP) had pondered changing the rules to prevent the AfD chairing the budget committee, which debates Germany's spending plans, including bailout aid for Greece.
The AfD has put forward lawmaker Peter Boehringer to chair the committee, whose members will have to vote on his appointment.
Plans to ostracise the AfD in the Bundestag were dropped by other parties after they concluded that this would only strengthen the party, which says Islam is incompatible with the German constitution.
The AfD became the third largest party in September's election, while both the conservatives and the SPD suffered steep losses after four years in coalition.
As a result, the SPD's rank and file are by no means certain to vote in favor of renewing that alliance after the conclusion of formal negotiations, which begin this Friday.
Germany is the largest contributor to euro zone rescue programs and, even though Boehringer could not single-handedly veto aid, his hostility toward the euro zone is likely to create tension.
Last year, he described as a ""disgrace"" French President Emmanuel Macron's proposals to install a euro zone finance minister and create a budget for the single currency bloc.

The AfD draws most of its support from people angry at Merkel's decision in 2015 to open Germany's borders to more than a million people seeking asylum, most of them Muslims from the Middle East.

Turkey says the soldiers are traitors and coup plotters and the issue has further strained relations between the two NATO allies who are at odds over issues ranging from jet flights over the Aegean Sea to ethnically split Cyprus.
Stavros Kontonis told reporters he had discussed the case of the eight soldiers with Turkish Deputy Justice Minister Bilal Uçar in Athens.
""Naturally, the case of the eight was discussed,"" he said. Greece's top court has rejected Turkey's request for the soldiers' extradition and, therefore, they would not be sent back, he said.

KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (Reuters) - U.S. forces in Afghanistan are deploying a squadron of A-10 ""Warthog"" ground attack aircraft, the U.S. military said on Tuesday, intensifying an air campaign that saw attacks more than triple in 2017 over the previous year. 
The number of U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan has spiked since President Donald Trump took office a year ago though the insurgents have hit back with deadly attacks, including a bloody Taliban raid on a Kabul hotel on the weekend.
The A-10 is returning to Afghanistan for the first time since 2012, with the squadron of 12 aircraft to operate from Kandahar air base in the south, the heartland of the militants fighting to oust the Western-backed government and drive out foreign forces.
U.S. Air Force Major General James Hecker said the A-10s were returning to meet an increased need for close air support in a campaign targeting Taliban revenue sources including drug-producing facilities and in counter-terrorism operations.
The new aircraft had already conducted their first attacks, continuing a campaign that increased in intensity since Washington gave commanders greater authority to perform air strikes last year.
""We've been taking the fight to the enemy for a while now,"" Hecker said. ""Here in 2017 alone, we've dropped more bombs than over the last two years. Over 4,000 bombs have been used against the Taliban, against ISIS etcetera,"" he said.
REAPER DRONES
Hecker said the success of the campaign against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria meant the A-10s could be deployed to Afghanistan instead of Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, where they would otherwise have been based.
In addition, MQ-9 Reaper drones would be deployed as part of a major increase in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) assets closer to levels seen at the height of the U.S. engagement in Afghanistan. 
""We're going to increase our ISR capacity here by about one third. That will get us somewhat close to the levels that we've had in the past,"" he said.
The Taliban have made steady inroads since NATO ended its main combat operation in 2014 and are now estimated to control or contest at least 40 percent of the country. Afghan commanders have regularly pleaded for more air support.
After a months-long review of his Afghanistan policy, Trump in August committed the United States to an open-ended conflict in the country and promised a stepped-up campaign against the Taliban insurgents.
The ""number of weapons released"" in U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan in 2017 was 4,361, according to U.S. Air Force data, compared with 1,337 the previous year.
The increase in air strikes has led to concerns over civilian casualties, particularly after the United Nations reported a spike in deaths caused by air strikes last year.

However U.S. commanders say the precision weapons used by the air force have meant an overall decrease in the number of civilian casualties from combat operations as fewer people have been killed in ground fighting.

909,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Police sought Secrets Act probe of Reuters reporters an hour after their arrest,"YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar police sought permission from the nation's president to go ahead with an investigation into whether two Reuters journalists had breached the Official Secrets Act only an hour after arresting them last month, a court heard on Tuesday.
Reporters Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in Rakhine state, where 688,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled an army crackdown on insurgents since late August, according to estimates by the United Nations.
They were detained on Dec. 12 after they had been invited to meet police officers over dinner in Yangon. The reporters have told relatives they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some documents at a restaurant by two policemen they had not met before. 
The prosecution's first witness in the case, Police Lieutenant Colonel Yu Naing of Yangon's northern district, told the court in Yangon that authorization was sought that evening from President Htin Kyaw's office to proceed with a case under the little-used colonial-era Official Secrets Act.
""The accused were arrested around 9 o'clock on the 12th, and ... the letter to ask permission from the president's office was ready at 10 o'clock,"" said defense lawyer Than Zaw Aung, referring to the court testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Yu Naing.
The authorization from the president's office came through the next day, Dec. 13.
Another defense lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, said such speed was unusual, and that typically such authorizations would be sought about a week into a probe and would be issued by a lower-ranked minister rather than the president.
Reuters contacted Zaw Htay, spokesman for national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, to ask why the case had been escalated within an hour to the president's office. He said in a text message that he could not immediately comment.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo last appeared in court on Jan. 10, when prosecutors sought charges against them under the Official Secrets Act, which dates back to 1923 - when Myanmar, then known as Burma, was under British rule - and carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
They have been accused under Section 3.1 (c) of the act, which covers entering prohibited places, and taking images or obtaining secret official documents that ""might be or is intended to be, directly or indirectly, useful to an enemy"".
The prosecution witness, Lieutenant Colonel Yu Naing, said the reporters were arrested while they were walking along a road carrying four official documents that included a listing of forces and weapons of a police battalion in the Maungdaw district of Rakhine state.
They were also found to have a report on an attack by Rohingya insurgents on a police outpost and a sketch of a map showing the post, as well as a copy of a report on the status of Rohingya villages following the military crackdown, according to a document Yu Naing read out in court. 
BAIL APPLICATION HEARING 
The Ministry of Information has previously cited police as saying the two journalists were ""arrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces"". It has said they ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media"".
Yu Naing repeatedly told the court ""I don't know"", when asked about the circumstances of the arrest because it was only reported to him by subordinates. He could not point to evidence that the defendants were acting for the enemy or hostile forces, defense lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told reporters after the hearing.
He has previously said that the prosecution has 24 other witnesses in the case, more than half of whom are police. 
A ruling on an application for bail will be announced at the court's next hearing, on Feb. 1, Khin Maung Zaw said. 
The prosecution has objected to the request for bail.
In a statement, Reuters said: ""We await the court's ruling on bail. Time is of the essence and we continue to call for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo's prompt release. They are innocent of any wrongdoing and should be allowed to return to their jobs reporting on events in Myanmar.""
The two journalists were handcuffed as they were led into the court.
Wa Lone smiled and gave a thumbs-up sign to the crowd there, which included relatives, reporters and diplomats from at least six countries and the United Nations and European Union.
During a break, the reporters received fruit from family members and spoke with them. Kyaw Soe Oo briefly hugged his two-year-old daughter.
Government officials from some of the world's major nations, including the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have called for the reporters to be freed.
""We are disappointed that, at a minimum, they have still not been granted bail,"" the U.S. embassy in Yangon said on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. ""Their arrests were highly irregular and have hurt press freedom in Myanmar. We call again for their release so they could be with their families and return to their jobs.""
Former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson said last week that he would work towards securing the release of the two journalists in his capacity as a member of an international advisory board on the crisis in Rakhine state.

He was hoping to raise the case with Minister of Home Affairs Lieutenant General Kyaw Swe during a visit to Myanmar's capital, Naypyitaw, this week. Asked about his efforts, he told Reuters in Naypyitaw on Tuesday: ""I am working on it.""

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's judiciary is unable to start an inquiry into alleged corruption because President Jacob Zuma is yet to provide terms of reference, the enquiry's head said on Tuesday.
The two-week delay is fresh evidence that Zuma wants to stall the investigation, said the opposition Democratic Alliance, which has previously accused Zuma of corruption.
Zuma established the inquiry into charges by the opposition, civil society and members of the ruling party that individuals including business associates of Zuma unduly influenced state tenders and cabinet appointments. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo was chosen on Jan. 9 to lead it.
""The commission is still waiting for the terms of reference to be finalised. The presidency is working on them,"" Zondo told reporters. ""I have no doubt that that is being attended to with the urgency that it requires."" 
Zuma tried to block the inquiry but a high court last month ordered him to establish one.
The presidency did not respond to a request for comment.
Zuma's supporters say any investigation should cover the undue influence all private business has over government, with a focus on firms owned by white South Africans who have dominated the economy for decades.
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) said on Monday it is in the process of deciding whether to cut short Zuma's tenure as head of state. Zuma took power in 2009 but is due to step down after elections next year.
Zuma's power has waned since Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa succeeded him as ANC leader last month, putting him in pole position to become national leader at elections next year and shifting attention to the succession.
Ramaphosa has made it a priority to fight government corruption, accusations of which have marked Zuma's tenure.
In 2016, the public protector, a constitutionally-mandated anti-graft body, recommended a judicial inquiry be established to further probe her findings about the undue influence the Gupta family wielded over Zuma and his government.
There is a fierce debate among politicians and the South African public over what the long-awaited inquiry should cover.
Zuma's opponents say it must focus on the role of his friends, the Gupta brothers, who own several companies that have large contracts with state-owned companies.
The opposition says Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta secured senior cabinet positions for politicians in Zuma's government and paid kickbacks to win contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
""Zuma announced the establishment of a commission of inquiry at a time when he was under pressure but ... he has little intention of following through,"" Democratic Alliance Federal Council Chairperson James Selfe said in a statement
""His (Zondo) press conference was little more than a cry for help, letting South Africa know that the Judiciary's hands are tied,"" Selfe said.

Zuma and the Guptas deny wrongdoing and say they are victims of a witch hunt.

911,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",Senior Yemen Qaeda leader calls for knife and car attacks on Jews,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A senior leader of al Qaeda's Yemen branch has called for knife and car attacks on Jews in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the U.S. SITE monitoring group said on Tuesday.
Citing a video recording by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's al-Malahem media foundation, SITE said that Khaled Batarfi, believed to be the number two man in AQAP after Qassim al-Raymi, also warned that no Muslim had the right to cede any part of Jerusalem.
""The Muslims inside the occupied land must kill every Jew, by running him over, or stabbing him, or by using against him any weapon, or by burning their homes,"" Batarfi said in the 18-minute-long recording entitled ""Our duty towards our Jerusalem"", according to SITE.
""Every Muslim must know that the Americans and the disbeliever West, and on top of them Britain and France, are the original reason behind the existence of the Jews in Palestine.""
Trump enraged Muslims last month when he announced that the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and said he intends to transfer the U.S. embassy there.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, on a regional visit, said on Monday that the U.S. Embassy will be moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv before the end of 2019. 
Batarfi was one of some 150 jailed AQAP members who were freed when the militant group, regarded by the United States as one of the deadliest branches of the network founded by Osama bin Laden, captured the Yemeni port city of Mukalla in 2015, where he was held.
Yemeni forces, baked by a Saudi-led coalition have since recaptured Mukalla and driven AQAP out, but Batarfi, who has since assumed a senior position in the group, remains at large.
AQAP has plotted to down U.S. airliners and claimed responsibility for 2015 attacks on the office of Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. AQAP also has boasted of the world’s most feared bomb makers, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, and the Pentagon estimates it has between about 2,000 and 3,000 fighters. 
Batarfi said Muslims in Western countries, including the United States, were obliged to target the interests of Jews and the Americans.
""They must be eager to prepare themselves as much as possible, and to carry out jihadi operations against them,"" he added, according to SITE.
Palestinians seek East Jerusalem, including the walled Old City with its holy sites, as the capital of their own future state. Israel, which annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it in 1967 in a move not internationally recognized, regards all of the city as its ""eternal and indivisible capital"".

912,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",Pro-EU academic battles euroskepticism in push to unseat Czech president,"By Robert Muller
KLATOVY, Czech Republic (Reuters) - Jiri Drahos is a staunch pro-European in one of the EU's most eurosceptic member states, and yet he is in a neck-and-neck race to win the Czech presidency this weekend.
A softly-spoken chemistry professor, Drahos has to overcome voters' suspicions that he is soft on immigration, and raise a relatively low profile - one third of the country did not even know who he was two months ago.
But the 68-year-old independent is uniting liberal voters with others generally disillusioned by incumbent President Milos Zeman, a heavy-weight of post-communist politics in the Czech Republic.
Opinion polls show that in the election run-off on Friday and Saturday, Drahos has a good chance of unseating Zeman - a man fond of alcohol, sniping at the elite and using foul language in public, as well as being a champion of friendlier relations with the power that dominated central Europe throughout the Cold War: Russia.
For some Czechs, Drahos offers a change of style they believe the country badly needs. ""It is about time the people understood that he is an educated, decent man, in a contrast to the current president,"" pensioner Frantisek Rendl told Reuters at a Drahos rally in Klatovy, a historic town about 130 km (80 miles) southwest of Prague.
Czech presidents hold relatively limited executive powers but they do appoint prime ministers, judges and central bankers. On top of this, they can exercise strong authority in forming public opinion which in turn helps to shape government policies.
Both 73-year-old Zeman and his predecessor Vaclav Klaus used the presidency to accuse the European Union repeatedly of imposing bureaucratic rules on the Czech Republic.
Here the tall, white-haired former head of the Academy of Sciences is likely to offer a significant change of tone, should he occupy the presidential office in Prague Castle.
For Drahos, the country needs to be at the heart of the EU project as Germany and France push for reform. ""I would very much like to see the Czech Republic at the table where Europe's future is decided,"" he told Reuters in an interview last month.
Drahos faces broad public scepticism. The EU's Eurobarometer survey last year found that 63 percent of Czechs distrust the EU, second only to Greeks who have endured eight years of austerity dictated by Brussels under their country's bailouts.
Zeman, a former Social Democrat prime minister and now also an independent, was once strongly pro-EU but has moved steadily to the right and to euroskepticism during his five years as president. 
""STOP IMMIGRANTS AND DRAHOS""
The battle for the Czech presidency is similar to elections in neighboring Slovakia, where pro-European liberal Andrej Kiska beat the then more skeptical Robert Fico, and Austria where economics professor Alexander Van der Bellen defeated a far-right opponent last year.
Drahos is vulnerable on immigration, with public opinion strongly against EU attempts to impose compulsory quotas for each member state to accept refugees. The Eurobarometer also showed 56 percent of Czechs opposed a common EU immigration policy, the highest among the 28 member states.
Like Zeman, Drahos opposes the quota scheme and the country has a tiny Muslim minority, accepting just 12 refugees last year under a one-off EU program. Yet he often has to field questions on refugees from Muslim countries, one of the main election issues even though immigration policy rests with the government and parliament, not the president.
Zeman's campaign portrays Drahos as someone who would open the borders, using the slogan: ""Stop the immigrants and Drahos. This country is ours.""
Drahos, who signed a call by scientists in 2015 for a sober and calm reaction to the European migration crisis, says the question of refugees needs a rational solution. ""We have to solve this as Europe. We can't wall-off our borders with concrete and wait till they start to climb over,"" he told the crowd in Klatovy.
Despite launching his presidential bid in March last year, an opinion poll in November showed 32 percent of voters still did not know Drahos. Nevertheless, he came second to Zeman in the first round earlier this month with 26.6 percent of the vote.
A poll on Monday put his support at 47 percent, narrowly ahead of Zeman with 43 percent, with the remaining 10 percent undecided.
Many undecideds don't like his pro-European views in a country that has yet to adopt the euro, even though it joined the EU 14 years ago. But neither do they like Zeman's calls for closer ties with Russia and his criticism of Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over the Ukraine crisis.
""I know Zeman, he has been in politics for a long time, I don't know Drahos. Zeman has experience in politics, Drahos has not been in politics,"" said one of the undecideds, 61-year-old Prague receptionist Petra Kubickova. ""About Drahos, I don't like that he wants the euro, about Zeman, that he sides with Russia,"" she told Reuters.
COMMON SENSE
A father of two daughters, Drahos plays the piano and was once in a rock band, as well as singing in a chamber choir for four decades. His latest campaign video shows him jogging through a forest and he is also a keen cross-country skier.
This contrasts with Zeman, a heavy smoker who has based his folksy appeal on a liking for drinking and fatty pork dishes. Photographs released last year of Zeman standing on skis provoked a skeptical response on social media due to his diabetes and difficulty in walking.
Drahos joined the Academy of Sciences as a researcher in 1976 and declined several offers to join the Communist Party, an option that many professionals took to advance their careers.
Only after the fall of the communism in 1989 did he climb to top positions, chairing the Academy from 2009-2017.
""Jiri Drahos is absolutely reliable,"" said Jan Palous, an astrophysicist who sat on the Academy board with him. While outside conventional politics, Drahos still had to navigate the academic ""jungle of opinions"" behind the scenes. ""He is not indecisive,"" Palous told Reuters.
News websites sympathetic to Zeman and Russia have targeted Drahos, accusing him of being an informant for the StB communist secret police or even a pedophile. 
Drahos, who says he refused an StB request to inform on his colleagues, brushes this off. 

""I can assure you that you will hear many things, even nasty things about this Drahos,"" he told a rally in the town of Horsovsky Tyn. ""Please don't trust them. I can only appeal to your common sense.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea said on Tuesday it had a ""powerful and reliable"" nuclear deterrent to thwart any attack and accused the United States of deploying military assets nearby under the pretext of ensuring security at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Han Tae Song, North Korea's Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, called on the United States to permanently halt its joint military drills with South Korea, suspended ahead of the Games that open on Feb. 9 amid an easing of tensions.
Han said contrary to the trend toward ""detente"", U.S. forces were engaging in a ""precarious military maneuver"" by bringing their strategic assets near the divided Korean peninsula ahead of the competition.
""This is a dangerous act of throwing a wet blanket over the current positive atmosphere of inter-Korean relations, which could drive the situation again into an extreme phase of confrontation,"" Han told the U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Monday a thaw in relations between the two Koreas ahead of the Winter Olympics presented a ""precious chance"" for the United States and North Korea to discuss the North's weapons programs.
North Korea is developing missile and nuclear technology amid regular threats to destroy the United States and Japan and in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.
'GRAVE AND IMMINENT THREAT'
Japan's envoy Nobushige Takamizawa said North Korea's nuclear and missile deployment constituted ""a grave and imminent threat to the international community"" and pressure must be increased on Pyongyang.
Han said nuclear tests last year had allowed his country to ""perfect a national nuclear force"" in a safe and transparent manner.
""Thus the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) at last came to possess a powerful and reliable war deterrent, which no force and nothing can reverse,"" he told the Geneva forum.
""I am proudly saying that DPRK's nuclear force is capable of frustrating and countering any nuclear threats from the U.S. and it constitutes a powerful deterrent that prevents the U.S. from starting an adventurous war."" 
Han said as a ""responsible nuclear power"" North Korea could not resort to using the weapons unless hostile forces violate its sovereignty or interests.
U.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood said: ""The United States will not recognize North Korea as a nuclear weapon state.
""If the North wishes to return and be in the good graces of the international community, it knows what it has to do, it has to take steps toward denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.""
""The international pressure on North Korea is profound, it is intense and it will continue,"" he added.
Wood, asked whether the inter-Korean dialogue was due to pressure on Pyongyang, later told reporters: ""Absolutely, I think it very clear that the pressure the international community has put upon North Korea has got it to take a much softer tone with regard to the Republic of Korea and its desire now to participate in the upcoming Olympics.""

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A founder of a Pakistani militant group blacklisted by the United Nations for terrorism said on Tuesday he had filed a court petition to halt government plans to seize control of his charities.
Hafiz Saeed is the founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), or Army of the Pure, blamed by the United States, India for four days of shootings and bombings in Mumbai in 2008 that killed 166 people.
LeT, Saeed and charities that he controls are all included on terrorism blacklists by the U.N. Security Council and the United States. He denies any role in the Mumbai attacks and says he and his charities have no links to militants.
Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said on Monday his government will push ahead with a plan to take control of charities linked to Saeed.
Pakistan's government placed Saeed under house arrest a year ago, but he was released in November after a court ruled there was no evidence to hold him. 
Under pressure from the United States, United Nations and international institutions to crack down on terrorist financing, Pakistan drew up secret plans in December for a ""takeover"" of charities linked to Saeed.
The United States calls Saeed's charities -- Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and the Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation (FIF) -- ""terrorist fronts"" for LeT, which Saeed co-founded in 1987.
Pakistan's plans to seize the assets were drawn up ahead of a U.N. Security Council team visiting Islamabad this month to review the country's progress against blacklisted groups.
""We have filed a writ petition in the high court regarding these news which are going on in the media about the government's measures (against us) or the United Nations delegation arriving here,"" Saeed said in a press conference in the eastern city of Lahore where his charities are based.
He said any government moves against him would be carrying out the will of the United States and India.
Saeed's freedom in Pakistan, where he holds public rallies, has been a thorn in Islamabad's relations with India and the United States.
Saeed said the charities broke no laws, and offered to allow the U.N. team to visit projects they run. 

""Any delegation from any corner of the world can visit there,"" he said. ""All of our work across Pakistan can be checked. We are not doing anything illegal.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday the timing of a long-awaited U.S. Middle East peace initiative depended on the return of Palestinians to negotiations.
President Donald Trump's advisers have been working on the outlines of a plan for some time. But Palestinians ruled out Washington as a peace broker after the U.S. president's Dec. 6 recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. 
""The White House has been working with our partners in the region to see if we can develop a framework for peace,"" Pence told Reuters in an interview in Jerusalem on the last leg of a three-day Middle East trip. ""It all just depends now on when the Palestinians are going to come back to the table."" 
Trump's Jerusalem move angered the Palestinians, sparked protests in the Middle East and raised concern among Western countries that it could further destabilize the region. Palestinians see East Jerusalem as capital of a future state. 
A White House official told reporters he hoped the plan would be announced in 2018. 
""It'll come out both when it's ready and when both sides are actually willing to engage on it,"" said the White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The official acknowledged that the United States and the Palestinian leadership had not had any direct diplomatic contact since Trump's Jerusalem declaration.
Pence said in the interview that he and the president believed the decision, under which the United States also plans to move its embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, would improve peacemaking prospects.
Hanan Ashrawi, a senior official at the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), said the Trump administration had dealt a death blow to any prospect for peace.
""The extremist positions of this U.S. administration and the biblical messianic message of Pence not only disqualified the U.S. as a peace broker but created conditions of volatility and instability in the region and beyond,"" Ashrawi said in the West Bank city of Ramallah.  
Pence discussed the Jerusalem issue during talks with Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Saturday and Jordan's King Abdullah on Sunday. He said the two leaders had agreed to convey to the Palestinians that the United States was eager to resume peace talks.
""We want them (the Palestinians) to know the door is open. We understand they're unhappy with that decision but the president wanted me to convey our willingness and desire to be a part of the peace process going forward,"" Pence said. 
Asked if the Egyptians and Jordanians had agreed to pressure the Palestinians to return to talks, Pence said: ""I wouldn't characterize it as that.""
SUPPORTER OF NETANYAHU
The Palestinians want to establish an independent state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital. 
Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. It says the entire city is its eternal and indivisible capital. 
Pence said the U.S. State Department would spell out details in the coming weeks about a plan to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem by the end of 2019. 
Israeli media have speculated that a 2019 embassy move could help Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu win reelection in a vote scheduled for November of that year.
Pence said he admired Netanyahu's leadership and appreciated his friendship. Asked if he hoped for the prime minister's reelection, Pence said: ""I'm a strong supporter of Benjamin Netanyahu, but I don't get a vote here.""
Pence toured Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial with Netanyahu on Tuesday before visiting the Western Wall, one of Judaism's holiest sites. He stood solemnly with his hand on the wall and left a note, as people who pray there traditionally do.
The vice president also pressed European leaders to heed Trump's call to forge a follow-up agreement to the Iran nuclear deal established under President Barack Obama's administration.
""At the end of the day, this is going to be a moment where the European community has to decide whether they want to go forward with the United States or whether they want to stay in this deeply flawed deal with Iran,"" he said.
Asked if he thought the United States would succeed in getting that kind of agreement with its European allies, Pence said: ""We'll see.""

Trump said earlier this month the United States would withdraw from the agreement unless its flaws were fixed.

Britain will leave the EU in March, 2019, and the remaining 27 countries in the bloc will vote in European Parliament elections two months later.
The 27 are now getting ready for negotiations with London on a two-year transition period after Brexit, before launching talks in spring on a new deal from 2021. [nL8N1PD4E5]

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May slapped down her foreign minister on Tuesday after he demanded more funding for Britain's public health service, telling him any discussion of money saved from Brexit should be kept private.
Boris Johnson, whose promises that Britain's departure from the European Union would boost funds for the National Health Service helped persuade many voters to back Brexit, raised his demands at a regular meeting of her top ministers after publicly calling for an extra 100 million pounds ($140 million) a week.
But the response was swift. May, trying to reassert her authority, said any money saved from Brexit would be spent on her priorities, including health, and that ministers should not air discussions outside her cabinet meetings. 
""The prime minister and a large number of cabinet ministers made the point that cabinet discussions should take place in private,"" her spokesman told reporters, describing the hour-long discussion on the NHS as ""constructive"". 
""As regards the future, and how the return of any EU contribution would be spent, the prime minister reminded cabinet that the government has consistently said that we will spend money on our priorities such as housing, schools and the NHS.""
May is under pressure over the state of the health service from the opposition Labour Party, which says healthcare is being put ""recklessly"" at risk by ministers unable to tackle bed shortages and thousands of canceled operations.
Under fire from some lawmakers in her own party for lacking direction on some of the most pressing concerns in Britain, May is also trying to keep the warring factions of her cabinet of top ministers united as she negotiates Brexit.
But divisions over the so-called Brexit dividend - the funds that will be freed up when Britain stops paying into EU coffers - are deepening, with the ministers for health, education and defense and others bidding for more funds for their departments.
""DULL DULL DULL""
Shortly after Johnson made his demand, finance minister Philip Hammond fought back by saying he had already increased payments to the NHS. May has repeatedly said that funding is at record levels.
""Mr Johnson is the foreign secretary,"" Hammond told reporters in Brussels.
""I gave the health secretary an extra 6 billion pounds at the recent budget and we'll look at departmental allocations again at the spending review when that takes place.""
The row is yet another headache for May, whose weakness since losing her party's majority at an election last June was underlined by a botched reshuffle of her top team of ministers earlier this month.
With the Conservatives increasingly concerned that Labour is setting the political agenda in Britain by focusing on health, housing and education, many members of the ruling party say it needs to show more clearly what they hold to be the benefits of Brexit.
Johnson and other Brexit supporters said during the campaign for the 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union that Britain pays 350 million pounds a week to the bloc and promised to spend the money on the NHS instead if Britain voted to leave. 
The figure was challenged by critics who said it did not reflect Britain's rebate and payments made into Britain by the EU. 
Mindful of that promise, some Conservatives are calling for the government to increase funding.
""We have to deliver Brexit and deliver for the NHS,"" Andrew Bridgen, a pro-Brexit lawmaker, told Reuters.
Others went further, saying May had to do a lot more to win over younger voters and challenge Labour's leftist leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has a loyal following in many cities. 

""They must have really sound reasons to vote Conservative. We really need to get on with this #wherestheboldandbrave sofaritsdulldulldull,"" Conservative lawmaker Nicholas Soames said on Twitter.

PARIS (Reuters) - Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will give an outline of the United States' strategy to stabilize Syria and push ahead with a political solution when he holds talks with close allies in Paris on Tuesday, Western and Arab diplomats said. 
Tillerson will first attend a meeting hosted by France on an initiative to target those responsible for chemical attacks, largely in Syria. He then holds informal consultations on the Syrian strategy with a smaller group of foreign ministers from key allies - Britain, France, Germany, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.
""We'll know more later, but Tillerson will present a paper on Syria,"" said a Middle Eastern diplomat. 
This month Tillerson signaled an open-ended U.S. military presence in Syria as part of a broader strategy to prevent Islamic State’s resurgence and pave the way for the eventual departure of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
In the speech he called for ""patience"" on Assad’s departure - the clearest indication yet of U.S. acceptance that Russia and Iran have bolstered Assad and that he is unlikely to leave power immediately. Tillerson said the U.S. strategy would focus on diplomatic efforts. 
It was not clear how detailed Tillerson's presentation would be or whether it would be form a basis to approach Russia, a key backer of Assad, which will host a Syrian peace congress in Sochi on Jan 29-30.
The foreign minister of Turkey, which has launched a major military offensive targeting Kurdish YPG forces in northwest Syria, will attend the chemical weapons meeting but was not due to join the consultations on Washington's Syrian strategy.
Ties between NATO allies Turkey and the United States have become badly strained over a number of issues, including U.S. support for the YPG, which Ankara sees as a security threat.
CHEMICAL WEAPONS 
At the meeting on chemical weapons 29 countries are expected to agree to work more closely on targeting those behind chemical weapons attacks and imposing necessary sanctions on them.
As a first step, France on Tuesday imposed unilateral sanctions on 25 people and entities, including from China, Lebanon and France, and among them importers and distributors of metals, electronics and lighting systems. It said the companies were helping to supply Syria's chemical weapons program. 
A joint inquiry of the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) determined that the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin in an April 4, 2017, attack and also used several times chlorine as a weapon.
Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States. The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons.

PALONG KHALI, Bangladesh/NAYPYITAW, Myanmar (Reuters) - The U.N. refugee agency and other groups have urged a rethink of the plan to send Rohingya refugees back to Myanmar amid fears of forced repatriations and the inability of aid agencies to ensure the safety of hundreds of thousands who fled bloodshed at home. 
The calls come as Bangladesh delayed the repatriation of the largely stateless Rohingya to Myanmar as the process of compiling and verifying the list of people to be sent back was incomplete.
""In order for the repatriation to be (done) right, to be sustainable, actually viable ... you need to really address a number of issues that for the time being we have heard nothing about,"" UNHCR head Filippo Grandi said in Geneva, noting that issues like citizenship had not been addressed.
More than 688,000 Muslim Rohingya and a few hundred Hindu Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since Aug. 25 last year after the Myanmar military cracked down in the northern part of Rakhine state, amid witness reports of killings, looting and rape, in response to militant attacks on security forces.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the plight of the Rohingya was even worse than media portrayals.
""This is a tragedy that's worse than anything that CNN or BBC has been able to portray,"" Mattis said, speaking to reporters during a trip to Indonesia.
Many in Buddhist-majority Myanmar regard the Rohingya community as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The United Nations described Myanmar's crackdown as ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, which Myanmar denies.
Grandi said it was important to set in place a monitoring mechanism in Rakhine for those returning and noted the UNHCR currently did not have the ability to move freely and perform this role there. 
Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed earlier this month to complete a voluntary repatriation of the refugees in two years. Myanmar says it had set up two reception centers and a temporary camp near the border in Rakhine to receive the first arrivals. 
Human Rights Watch, a non-government organization, said on Tuesday that Bangladesh should suspend the plan entirely as it ""threatens the refugees' security and wellbeing"".
The plan has sparked fears in refugee camps in Bangladesh that people may be forced to return despite a lack of guarantees around their security. 
""We are not doing anything hurriedly. We are working hard to ensure their safe, dignified and sustainable return to their homeland. We'll not send anyone until a conducive environment is created for them,"" a Bangladeshi official, who participated in the repatriation talks with Myanmar, told Reuters on Tuesday.
He said that some 6,000 refugees, who are currently in no man's land between the two countries, were likely to be the first sent to the camps being set up in Myanmar.
Officials in Myanmar said they were ready to begin the repatriation process. 
""We are right now at the border ready to receive, if the Bangladeshis bring them to our side,"" Kyaw Tin, Minister of International Cooperation, told reporters in Naypyidaw, Myanmar's capital. 
He said Myanmar was ""prepared to receive 300 people a day"" to begin with. He said the repatriation would take place five days a week, and then be reviewed after three months to see if it can be accelerated.
Myanmar's Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement Minister Win Myat Aye said the repatriation would take place over the next two years, ""or maybe less"". 

""Whoever is eligible, we will accept,"" he said.

It was the second verdict against Kirov, who is already appealing a 10-year prison sentence handed down in 2015 in an earlier misappropriation case.
In the latest case, prosecutors said Kirov had ordered a subordinate to draw up false documents to siphon funds from the intelligence service budget.
He has denied wrongdoing and said he would appeal the new conviction, which he described as part of a politically motivated campaign to persuade foreigners that Bulgaria is cracking down on corruption.
""I think this case is of political nature,"" Kirov, 67, told Focus news website ""It is obvious that we have to show the international factors and our European partners that an important figure had been convicted.""
The European Union has repeatedly criticized Bulgaria, which now holds the EU's rotating presidency for the first time since joining the bloc in 2007, for failing to jail corrupt senior officials or overhaul an inefficient judiciary.
Bulgaria's center-right government, led by Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, faces a no-confidence vote over accusations that it has failed to tackle corruption. The motion is expected to fail this week.
Kirov was dismissed as the head of the national intelligence service in 2012 after nine years in office. Borissov initially named him as an adviser, but fired him after only two months.

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. monitors were among the targets of violence by Congolese security agents who used deadly force to disperse protests organized by the Catholic Church on Sunday, a U.N. human rights spokeswoman said.
Congolese security forces shot dead at least six people and wounded dozens more as they fired tear gas to disperse a protest in Kinshasa against President Joseph Kabila.
U.N. rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a U.N. briefing in Geneva on Tuesday that 68 people were wounded and 121 arrested, and the United Nations had information about ""a number of other killings"" in protests elsewhere in the country. 
One of those injured was a U.N. human rights monitor who was punched and kicked by security forces, despite wearing a blue U.N. vest with a human rights logo and working under the long-established U.N. mandate to observe demonstrations, she said.
""He was in the right place at the right time. He was there to monitor the protests and the conduct of the security forces in the context of the protests,"" she said.
After he was beaten up, the U.N. team came back to monitor the protest but military police fired tear gas to stop them doing their work.
""They were targeted,"" Shamdasani said. ""This is the U.N. we are talking about. If security forces are going to be so brazen as to even attack the U.N., then we are very concerned about they way they are going to be treating other protesters.""
The U.N. mission in Congo was taking up the incident with the authorities, and wanted an investigation into the killings, she said.
""It is not our hope that they will investigate, it's their obligation to investigate. It is the obligation of the government to ensure that security forces are handling protests in line with the law.""
A Congo government spokesman was not immediately reachable to comment.
Kabila's refusal to step down at the end of his mandate in December 2016 has triggered a series of street protests, and emboldened armed rebel groups, who are starting to coalesce in opposition, a U.N. official said last week.
Shamdasani said Internet and SMS services had been suspended since Saturday night, and tear gas was fired into and around churches in Kinshasa, Goma, Kisangani, Lubumbashi and Bukavu, while there were heavy deployments of security forces around places of worship in Mbandaka, Beni, Mbuji-Mayi and Butembo.
""The Catholic church is rallying people, mobilizing people to stand up for their rights. This is why you've seen that there are attacks against churches, tear gas being fired into churches, and people prevented from going in and in some cases prevented from coming out of churches after services.""

MADRID/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Spanish authorities are monitoring borders to make sure that fugitive Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont does not sneak back into Spain to take up the presidency of the regional parliament again, a senior minister said on Tuesday.
Puigdemont, speaking in Copenhagen, said his return from self-exile to Barcelona would be good for Spanish democracy, but he stopped short of saying if and when he would go home.
Puigdemont has said he can rule from Belgium, where he fled to in October to avoid arrest for his part in organizing an illegal referendum on a split by Catalonia from Spain and a subsequent unilateral declaration of independence.
The Madrid government, however, says no one can be named or rule remotely. 
Puigdemont told a news conference in the Danish capital that a huge majority of the Catalan parliament supported him taking up the role of regional president once more following an election in December. 
""My return to Barcelona will not only be good news for Catalan people who support our cause but also for Spanish people and Spanish democracy,"" he said.
But he did not say exactly when he planned to return to Spain when questioned on the matter.
In Madrid, Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said he was worried that the 55-year old -- who faces arrest the minute he steps back in Spain -- could now try to discreetly return to the parliament in Barcelona for a vote on his candidacy.
""We're making sure this cannot happen, at the borders and within the borders, everywhere,"" Zoido told Antena 3 TV. ""We'll make sure he cannot get in, even (hidden) in the boot of a car,"" he said.
Catalan lawmakers are set to vote on Puigdemont's candidacy by Jan. 31. 
Puigdemont on Tuesday withdrew a request to be allowed to vote for himself by proxy, a source in his party said, without saying why he had dropped that demand or if it meant he planned to be in parliament in person for the leadership vote.
His visit to Denmark to attend a university debate was his first trip outside Belgium since he arrived there in October following his dismissal by the Madrid government and its imposition of direct rule on the semi-autonomous region.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called a new regional election in December in a bid to defuse the crisis but his gamble failed when separatist parties won a majority, giving new impetus to the independence movement.
Puigdemont, a former journalist, potentially faces decades in prison in Spain if he is convicted of the charges leveled against him, including rebellion and sedition.

Rajoy has said the Madrid government would appeal to the courts and maintain direct rule of the wealthy northeastern region if Puigdemont was elected while abroad.

KABUL (Reuters) - A bloody raid on a high-end hotel guarded by a private company in the Afghan capital has stirred fresh debate about the contentious issue of the role of security firms in the violence-plagued county.
Five gunmen dressed in army uniforms made their way through two checkpoints before getting in to the hilltop Hotel Intercontinental, and going on a rampage in which at least 20 people were killed, including 13 foreigners.
Many details of what happened in the attack, which began at around 9 p.m. on Saturday and was not suppressed until the following day, remain unclear.
On Tuesday, security officials were meeting in the hotel, as guards of the Kabul Balkh Safety and Security Organisation (KBSS) stood outside, with rifles slung across their chests.
KBSS won the contract to guard the hotel three weeks ago, the government said.
The company's president, Sayed Rahimi, issued a statement saying it was ""too early to come to conclusions as to how this occurred"" and expressing condolences to the bereaved.
""We will fully cooperate with the government in the investigation. I don’t have anything else to say,"" Rahimi told Reuters when contacted by telephone.
A senior government security official involved in the investigation said the guards had offered little resistance.
""There were 15 guards on duty at time of the attack and none of them engaged the attackers,"" said the official, who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to the media.
""They were either watching the whole thing or hiding."" 
Former President Hamid Karzai issued a decree in 2010 banning private security firms. 
At the time, the government said the firms, which were estimated to employ some 40,000 people, were involved in weapons smuggling and shootings. Exceptions were later made for companies guarding embassies and development projects.
Most of the companies were operated by Afghans with good government connections and many with foreign partners, often ex-military men.
'VERY CONCERNING'
KBSS says on its website it has been operating since 2004. It also displays certificates of appreciation including some from the European Union and U.S. military.
Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish said investigators were looking into how the company got the job of guarding the Intercontinental Hotel, which is in public ownership and no longer part of the  Intercontinental Hotels Group  (LON:IHG).
A finance ministry official said the hotel management asked for the privatization of its security and the National Security Council (NSC) had approved it. Neither the hotel's manager nor NSC officials were available for comment.
Merdad Nejrabi, a member of parliament and chairman of its internal security committee, said private security was more of a problem than a help.
""These companies were disbanded for a reason,"" Nejrabi told Reuters. ""They were involved in arms smuggling, corruption, kidnapping and all that. Now that they have re-emerged, it is very concerning. 
""The privatization of security for Kabul, and particularly at important sites, has never been helpful.""
Another critic of the private security firms, member of parliament Farhad Sediqi, said the assembly planned to hold a special session to discuss the issue.
""It's wrong to hand over the security responsibility for important sites to private companies,"" Sediqi told Reuters.

President Ashraf Ghani's office declined to comment.

""With immediate effect we will suspend all armed actions against the British State,"" Oglaigh na hEireann, which was formed more than 10 years ago by senior ex-members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), said in a statement.
""While ONH accept that the right of the Irish People to use armed disciplined force to end the violation of Irish National Sovereignty is unquestionable ... our review has concluded that at this time the environment is not conducive to armed conflict."" 
The group, whose name translates loosely as ""Soldiers of Ireland"", is one of a handful of former IRA splinter groups that rejected the 1998 Good Friday peace deal, which ended three decades of conflict known as ""The Troubles"".
During the conflict, the Provisional IRA carried out shootings and bombings to pressure the British government into relinquishing Northern Ireland. Mainly Protestant unionist paramilitaries, who supported continued rule by Britain, also carried out attacks.
The IRA has since disarmed, and its former political wing Sinn Fein has spent most of the past decade serving in a power-sharing provincial government with the main unionist party.
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams welcomed the announcement that ONH was now rejecting violence. 
""There can be no excuse or justification for the continued existence and operation of armed groups either unionist or republican,"" Adams said in a statement. ""I call on all groups engaged in violent actions to desist, disband and to embrace the path of peaceful politics.""
ONH has claimed responsibility for a number of high-profile attacks, including a car bomb that severely disabled Catholic police officer Peadar Heffron in 2010. During The Troubles, nationalist paramilitaries considered Catholics who joined the police to be traitors.
In March 2013 the group left a bomb with 60 kilograms of explosives near a hotel where G8 leaders were due to meet three months later. 
It also targeted British army barracks and police stations in Northern Ireland, and carried out ""punishment shootings"", usually non-lethal shots to the leg of young men and boys.
In the two decades since the Good Friday agreement, a number of ex-IRA splinter factions have continued to carry out attacks, although far less frequently than before the peace deal. The deadliest took place just months after the agreement: the Omagh bombing in August 1998 that killed 29 people and wounded 220 others, carried out by a group calling itself the Real IRA.

The Shiv Sena, a partner in the governing coalition formed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP in the western state of Maharastra, has decided to contest elections on its own, the party's president, Uddhav Thackeray, said.
""We will contest elections in all states without making an alliance,"" Thackeray said.
The decision makes the Shiv Sena the first major political outfit to break an alliance with the BJP since Modi became prime minister in 2014.
""The BJP has always wanted an alliance of nationalist parties,"" said Keshav Upadhyay, a BJP spokesman in Maharashtra. ""The Sena's decision does not worry us. We have a strong network of cadres in the state to contest elections on our own."" 
The Shiv Sena enjoys considerable political clout in Maharastra, home to India's financial capital of Mumbai, and like the BJP, it believes India is a fundamentally Hindu nation, despite its secular constitution.
Despite being allies in the state government, power sharing has led to discord between the two parties. The chief minister of Maharashtra is a member of the BJP.
""The BJP has become arrogant after winning more seats in 2014 assembly elections, it has neglected its alliance partner in power sharing,"" said a senior Shiv Sena leader, who declined to be identified as the party is still in the state government.
Thackeray did not specify if the Sena would withdraw support to the state government in Maharashtra, where it has 63 seats in the 288-member state assembly, compared to the 122 held by the BJP.
In Davos, the state's chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, told reporters his government would complete its full five-year term.
The state government's popularity has waned because it has failed to tackle rural distress, said political analyst Pratap Asbe.
""It would be difficult for the BJP to secure a majority in Maharashtra in 2019 without the support of the Shiv Sena,"" he said.
In the last two decades, no party has won the votes needed to form a majority government in Maharashtra, which sends the second-largest number of lawmakers to India's parliament.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Authorities in China's southern province of Guangdong have canceled the legal license of human rights lawyer Sui Muqing, he told Reuters on Tuesday, a week after another prominent rights lawyer was detained following similar punishment.
Since coming to power in 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has presided over a sweeping crackdown on dissent, which has seen hundreds of rights lawyers and activists detained and dozens jailed.
""I've taken on a lot of relatively high-profile human rights cases,"" Sui told Reuters. ""This is the settling of accounts after the autumn harvest,"" he added, using a phrase that means to face the authorities after a movement has ended.
An active and outspoken rights lawyer based in the city of Guangzhou, Sui had regularly defended fellow lawyers and activists charged by the authorities.
The Guangdong justice bureau unexpectedly called him late on Monday, asking for a meeting the next day, at which officials handed him papers saying he had been disbarred for violating conduct rules for lawyers, Sui said.
The Guangdong justice bureau did not respond to requests for comment after office hours on Tuesday.
Yu Wensheng, another prominent rights lawyer who took on similar cases, was disbarred and then detained last week.
In its document notifying Sui of its decision, the bureau said he had broken China's law for lawyers, as well as rules on the conduct of lawyers and law firms, according to a picture of the document seen by Reuters.
As evidence, it cited Sui's failure to prevent a client from disrupting court order in Beijing in 2014, as well as an incident in which he took photos while meeting a client in a police station in the southwestern province of Sichuan in 2017.
In the Beijing case, Sui had been defending activist Ding Jiaxi, a leading figure in the ""New Citizen's Movement"" that called for Chinese officials to disclose their assets as a part of gradual political change in China.
Sui denied that he had broken the rules or the law and said the 2014 case was too far in the past to reasonably be used as evidence against him.
Rights groups say that 2016 changes to measures on the conduct of lawyers and law firms, which heightened requirements for political loyalty, were designed to make it much more difficult to take on politically sensitive cases.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Israel accused the United Nations on Tuesday of continuous discrimination against it over its treatment of Palestinians and called for reforms of its human rights body. 
The Human Rights Council's regular examination of Israel's record, the first since 2013, comes after U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem last month as the capital of Israel, angering Palestinians, Middle East leaders and world powers.
 Aviva  (LON:AV) Raz Shechter, Israel's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, told the Human Rights Council that her country had always stood up for human rights and democratic values.
""It has done so while facing serious threats to its security, and while needing to integrate diverse communities and religious groups,"" Shechter told the Geneva forum.
The Council has taken a strong position against Israel's occupation of territory seized in the 1967 Middle East war, its treatment of Palestinians there, and its building of Jewish settlements.
Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005. Most countries consider the settlements, in areas of the West Bank and Jerusalem the Palestinians see as part of an eventual independent state, illegal, but Israel disputes this and continues their expansion. 
An ""unparalleled number of one-sided biased and political resolutions adopted regularly by the automatic majority of its members testify not only to the unfair treatment of the State of Israel, but also to the deficiencies of the Council itself and its agenda,"" Schechter said. 
""...this theater of the absurd cannot go on forever."" 
Washington says the Council is stacked with opponents of Israel and U.S. ambassador Niki Haley told the Council last June that it was reviewing its participation given what it sees as its ""chronic anti-Israel bias"".
Israel considered its relations with the Palestinians to be ""of the highest priority"" and it would continue to seek a lasting solution that would enable the two peoples to live side by side in peace and security, she said.
Jordan's diplomat Akram Harahsheh, speaking first in the three-hour debate, condemned what he said were ""attempts to prejudge the identity of occupied Jerusalem"" and called on Israel to withdraw from all territories occupied since 1967.

The 21-year-old activist, who has become the face of Hong Kong's movement to push for full democracy and defend its autonomy, is appealing against a three-month jail sentence for disobeying a court order and not leaving a protest zone.
Chief Judge of the High Court Andrew Cheung said it was arguable whether the previous judge had given sufficient consideration to the then 18-year-old Wong's age. 
Another young activist leader, Raphael Wong, 29, appealed against his conviction and his sentence of 4.5 months, but his bail application was rejected. 
""I want genuine universal suffrage,"" he shouted as he was led out of the courtroom, while Joshua Wong appeared calm.

938,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 05:07AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Looted cash, gold helps Islamic State recruit in Philippines","By Tom Allard
MARAWI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - Islamist insurgents looted cash, gold and jewellery worth tens of millions of dollars when they occupied a southern Philippines town last year, treasure one of their leaders has used to recruit around 250 fighters for fresh attacks.
The military said Humam Abdul Najib escaped from Marawi City, which the militants had hoped to establish as a stronghold for Islamic State in Southeast Asia, before it was recaptured by the military in October after five months of ferocious battles and aerial bombardment. 
Since then, Najib, also known as Abu Dar, has used the booty looted from bank vaults, shops and homes in Marawi to win over boys and young men in the impoverished southern province of Lanao del Sur, military officers in the area said. Hardened mercenaries are also joining, lured by the promise of money. 
As a result, Islamic State followers remain a potent threat in Southeast Asia even though hundreds of militants were killed in the battle for Marawi, the officers said.
""Definitely they haven't abandoned their intent to create a caliphate in Southeast Asia,"" Colonel Romeo Brawner, the deputy commander of Joint Task Force Marawi, told Reuters.
""That's the overall objective, but in the meantime while they are still trying to recover and build up again - fighters and weapons - our estimate is they are going to launch terrorist attacks.""
On Saturday, militants wounded eight soldiers in two attacks in Lanao del Sur, Brawner said, the first such violence since the recapture of Marawi.
In the early days of the occupation of Marawi last May, as black-clad fighters burned churches, released prisoners and cut the power supply, other militants targeted banks and the homes of wealthy citizens, commandeering hostages to help with the plunder.
""It was in the first week. They divided us into three groups with seven people each,"" said J.R. Montesa, a Christian construction worker who was captured by the militants.
Using explosives, the militants blew open the vaults of the city's three main banks, Landbank, the Philippine National Bank and the Al Amanah Islamic Bank, Montesa told Reuters in a town near Marawi. They trucked away the booty, easily slipping out of Marawi because a security cordon was not fully in place.
They also raided jewellery stores, pawnshops and businesses.
Landbank and Al Amanah did not respond to requests for comment. Philippine National said recovering losses because of the Marawi fighting was a concern, but did not give details. 
The Islamic celebration of Ramadan was looming at the time the militants struck and banks, businesses and homes had more money than usual, said Marawi City police chief Ebra Moxsir. The Maranaos, the ethnic group that dominates the area around Marawi, are mostly Muslims.
""There was a lot of money inside the battle area,"" he told Reuters. ""Maranaos keep millions of pesos in safety vaults in their homes. Gold, also. It is a tradition of the Maranao to give gifts of money (during Ramadan).""
Montesa said vans they loaded with the spoils of the raids were ""overflowing"", with money, gold and other valuables stuffed into every crevice of the vehicles.
""They were saying it was a gift from Allah. They would say 'Allahu Akbar' (God is greatest) while we were stealing.""
DANGEROUS REGROUPING
The military and police have also been accused by rights groups and by Marawi residents of looting during the conflict.
Brawner said a small number of soldiers had been disciplined for looting but the practice was not widespread.
However, the centre of Marawi - home to its major banks, main market and grandest residences - was under the control of militants for months. 
Brawner said authorities were unclear exactly how much was taken by the militants. 
""It’s hard for us to say. We have heard about 2 billion pesos ($39.4 million) but that's just an estimate.""
""In the first days, when we were not able to establish that security cordon around the main battle area, that was the time when they were able to slip out with their war booty.""
The government also said the regrouping of militants in Mindanao, the southern region of the Philippines that has been marred by Islamic and Communist uprisings for decades, was dangerous.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque told Reuters: ""There is always the danger of these groups regaining strength enough to mount another Marawi-like operation.""
Najib is believed to have fled Marawi early in the battle. There are conflicting reports about whether he had a dispute with other leaders or left as part of a preconceived plan.
He attempted to return in August with 50-100 more fighters to reinforce the militants, who by then were losing ground, but he was prevented by an improved security cordon, said Brawner.
""According to reports, they were able to recruit another 100 to 150. So the estimate is 250 all in all, and this includes children,"" Brawner said. ""They are trying to recruit orphans, relatives of the fighters who died and sympathisers.""
Parents of children are offered as much as 70,000 pesos ($1,380) plus a monthly salary of as much as 30,000 pesos ($590) to hand over their sons to the group, according to security sources and community leaders briefed on the recruitment.
The average family income in the Philippines is 22,000 pesos per month, according to a 2015 government survey. It was about half that in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao, where Marawi and surrounding areas lie.
Brawner said local residents had told the military that the militant group was also offering bonuses of up to 10,000 pesos ($200) for killing a soldier.
Rommel Banlaoi, a Manila-based security expert, said more experienced fighters had also been recruited. These were ""mercenaries"" attracted by the payouts, he said, but Najib has also tapped into disaffection among Maranao angered by the destruction of large parts of Marawi by the Philippine military's bombing campaign.
""That kind of narrative is being used by ISIS to lure people to continue the fight,"" Banlaoi said, using an acronym for Islamic State.
NEXT EMIR?
With the looted funds and a loyal following, Najib, could become the new ""emir"" of Islamic State in Southeast Asia following the death of Isnilon Hapilon in the battle for Marawi, security analysts say.
Najib is a hardened fighter and cleric who studied in the Middle East and reportedly trained with militants in Afghanistan, they say.
He co-founded Khalifa Islamiyah Mindanao, an insurgent group formed in about 2012 that launched a series of bombings in Mindanao. 
""He is a very, very important person because he has been there from the start,"" said Banlaoi.
Najib had links to Al Qaeda, which earned him the nickname ""al Zarqawi of the Philippines"", a reference to the slain leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), Abu Musab al Zarqawi. AQI morphed into Islamic State, to which Najib pledged allegiance in 2014.
According to Banlaoi, Najib worked closely with Mahmud Ahmad, a Malaysian militant believed to have died in Marawi who was the key conduit between the Philippines fighters and the Islamic State leadership in Syria and Iraq.
Banlaoi said the recruitment effort by the pro-Islamic State remnants led by Najib was ""massive and systematic"".

939,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>",China says it has no information on seized Swedish citizen,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday it had no information on a detained Swedish citizen and Hong Kong-based bookseller, Gui Minhai, after his daughter said he was seized from a train bound for the capital, Beijing. 
Gui was taken away on Saturday by plainclothes police, Angela Gui told Radio Sweden, adding that she was concerned for the safety of her father who was released from Chinese custody in October. His whereabouts since have been unclear. 
Angela Gui said her father was being escorted by two Swedish diplomats to seek medical attention for a neurological disorder. 
Sweden's foreign ministry said Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom had summoned China's ambassador over the issue.
In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she did not have any specific information about Gui's case.
""The Chinese and Swedish sides have very open communication channels,"" Hua told a daily news briefing.
""If there are any problems, from one or both sides, they can be raised, both sides can conduct timely and effective dialogue, this is no problem at all,"" she added. 
""But as for the Swedish Foreign Ministry's statement I have already said, as to the specific issue, I do not have any information at hand at this moment and you have to ask the relevant department in China.
""I believe the relevant department will handle the issue in accordance with the law,"" Hua said. 
China's Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request for comment. It was not possible to reach the Ministry of State Security, which has no website and does not have a publicly available telephone number.
In response to repeated questions regarding Gui's case, Hua said China helped facilitate the work of foreign diplomats in keeping with the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, while stressing that China hoped foreign diplomats, including those from Sweden, respected Chinese laws. 
""Any foreigner in China, including officials of foreign diplomatic missions, must not contravene international or Chinese laws,"" she said. ""This is basic common sense and a basic principle.""
Gui Minhai was abducted in Thailand while on holiday in 2015, one of five Hong Kong booksellers who went missing that year and later appeared in mainland Chinese custody. The four others have returned to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities said Gui, who published books on the personal lives of Communist Party leaders, was released in October last year after serving a sentence for a traffic offense in 2003.

The plane crashed in Akobo, in the Greater Upper Nile region, two weeks ago, Lam Paul Gabriel, the rebels' deputy spokesman, said.  
""When the plane crashed, it took a life. There was a lady that was killed and also there were some animals killed. The relatives of the lady and the owners of the cows are complaining they want compensation,"" he said.
""They (Kenyan leaders) have to write an official letter to Dr. Riek Machar and it will come to us to inform of an order, then we will release him.""
Machar, the country's former vice president, is the head of the largest rebel faction but has been held under house arrest in South Africa since 2016. 
South Sudan's military spokesman confirmed the two pilots were being held. 
""The plane had a technical problem. It crash-landed and killed a person on the ground,"" said Brigadier General Lul Ruai Koang. 
""The (rebel) SPLA-IO-appointed governor of the area has demanded the ransom of $200,000 which is beyond normal compensation for any person killed,"" he added. 
The Kenyan foreign ministry said it was unable to comment. 
Oil-rich South Sudan has been riven by civil war since 2013. The conflict has displaced a third of the population, shut down most of the oil production and wrecked the economy.

941,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",Indonesia looks to U.S. to relax limits on its special forces,"By Phil Stewart and Agustinus Beo Da Costa
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia said on Tuesday it was pinning its hopes on U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to help ease American limitations on ties with an elite Indonesian special forces unit, imposed over human rights abuses in the 1990s.
The United States announced in 2010 that it had lifted its outright ban on U.S. military contacts with the Indonesian special forces unit, known as Kopassus, which was accused of rights abuses in East Timor as it prepared for independence. 
But legal restrictions meant to ensure the U.S. military does not become entangled with rights abusers prevented contacts with Kopassus from advancing beyond preliminary levels, U.S. officials say.
""For a while there have been sanctions against Kopassus ... (Mattis) will try to remove this,"" Indonesian Defense Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu told reporters in Jakarta, following talks with the U.S. defense chief.
""One of the sanctions is clearly that they are not allowed to go to America. They can't do training together, and he will reopen this.""
Mattis expressed hope for deepening defense ties with Indonesia but he did not directly address Kopassus in his remarks to the press after talks with Ryacudu in Jakarta.
U.S. officials told reporters traveling with Mattis that they were exploring possible ways to expand contact with Kopassus, while complying with U.S. law. 
NORTH NATUNA SEA
Mattis' trip came as Indonesia, a vast archipelago of 17,000 islands, appears increasingly ready to assert its sovereignty in the contested South China Sea.
Indonesia has clashed with China over fishing rights around the Natuna Islands, detaining Chinese fishermen and expanding its military presence in the area in recent years.
In July, Indonesia renamed the northern reaches of its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea as the North Natuna Sea, a move seen as a significant act of resistance to China's territorial ambitions in the South China Sea.
Mattis seized upon Indonesia's name for the waterway as he praised the country's strategic maritime reach, calling the country ""a maritime fulcrum of the Indo-Pacific area."" 
""It's critical,"" Mattis said of Indonesia.
""We can help maintain maritime domain awareness in the South China Sea, the North Natuna Sea. This is something that we look forward to doing.""
The United States is one of Indonesia's top arms suppliers, recently delivering Boeing's Apache (NYSE:APA) helicopters and 24 of Lockheed Martin's F-16 fighter jets. But Indonesia also buys arms from U.S. rivals, including Russia.
U.S. officials said Indonesia asked for pricing for an additional 48 F-16 aircraft, a deal which could be worth $4.5 billion. But Indonesia played down any imminent purchase and suggested it was still evaluating how many more aircraft it needed. 
Ryacudu said Indonesia would buy weaponry when it ""has the money.""

""We only just bought F16s and everything. In (the) future there will definitely be (more purchases) because, as the years go by, there are things that must be replaced,"" he said.

942,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",Turkey detains 42 people over Syrian operation social media comments: agency,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police arrested 42 people including a pro-Kurdish politician overnight for ""spreading terrorist propaganda"" on social media about Turkey's military operation against a Kurdish militia in Syria, state media reported on Tuesday.
The police raids, which state-run Anadolu news agency said were focused on the Western province of Izmir, brought the number of such detentions to around 70 since ""Operation Olive Branch"" was launched at the weekend.
The incursion into the Afrin region targets the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish YPG, viewed by Ankara as a terrorist group and an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast since 1984.
Counter-terrorism squads launched simultaneous raids in various parts of Izmir and the nearby provinces of Denizli and Manisa, Anadolu said.
It said among those detained was the Izmir head of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), the second biggest opposition party in parliament and also accused by Ankara of being an extension of the PKK. It denies the accusation.
Among those arrested were also six suspects accused of spreading propaganda on the streets, which amounted to ""harassing people"", the agency said, adding that they were planning to hold a protest in a park.
Police carried out similar arrests related to social media posts across the country, detaining 14 suspects in the eastern provinces of Van, Igdir and Mus, and another five in the Mediterranean province of Mersin.
Ankara has enforced a crackdown since a failed coup in 2016 that critics say has unjustly targeted pro-Kurdish politicians. HDP lawmakers are in jail on terrorism charges, which they deny. 
More than 50,000 people have been jailed and face trial since the attempted putsch and 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from their jobs. The government says the moves were necessary given the security threats Turkey faces.
On Monday, authorities in Ankara banned all rallies, protests, meetings and concerts across the capital, for as long as the Afrin operation continues.

943,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 03:10AM ET</span>",Singapore reviewing anti-graft law amid mounting calls to make it tougher,"By Fathin Ungku and Aradhana Aravindan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's anti-corruption watchdog said it is reviewing the country's primary anti-graft law amid mounting pressure on the government to toughen the rules in the wake of revelations of criminal wrongdoing at companies in the city-state. 
Keppel Corp, which counts state investor Temasek Holdings (TEM.UL) as its largest shareholder, has agreed to pay more than $422 million to resolve probes by U.S., Brazilian and Singapore authorities on charges it bribed Brazilian officials.
The disclosure has dented Singapore's squeaky-clean image. It is ranked seventh-least corrupt nation in the world according to Transparency International, the global anti-corruption coalition based in Berlin.
Legal experts say that Singapore's Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA), the primary anti-graft law enacted in 1960, is outdated and inadequate in punishing and deterring wrongdoing in the corporate sector and needs to be bolstered. 
""The Singapore government regularly reviews the provisions in the PCA with a view toward improving the anti-corruption regime in Singapore,"" the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) said in a statement to Reuters late on Monday. 
""The PCA is currently going through a review,"" it said. 
The bureau, which is Singapore's anti-graft agency that investigates corruption in the public and private sectors, added it would be ""premature to comment on the specific details at this point of time."" 
The ongoing review was ""not connected to the Keppel case,"" a CPIB spokeswoman later said.
CPIB and the country's Attorney General's office said in late December they were investigating individuals related to Keppel's Brazil bribery case. 
Keppel's case was followed by revelation of extensive oil theft at Shell's biggest refinery, leading to charges against employees of the Singaporean subsidiary of the oil giant and people who worked for one of Singapore's biggest marine fuel suppliers.
For the PCA to be updated, experts on the country's fight against corruption suggest raising the law's financial penalty, currently a maximum of S$100,000 ($75,800) per offense.
""In today's context, a penalty of $100K per charge is on the low side. It may not have been so in 1989 when the penalty was set,"" said Eugene Tan, an associate professor of law at the Singapore Management University (SMU).
OBSOLETE AND NOT ENOUGH DETERRENCE 
This month, Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State for Law and Finance, said in parliament any penalty for Keppel under Singapore law would have been far less than what it was now liable for under the global resolution. The company was fined nearly eight times the value of the alleged bribes of $55 million.
Under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, companies can be fined up to $2 million per violation.
Pritam Singh of the Workers' Party, Singapore's only opposition party in parliament, told Reuters: ""Tougher penalties will have a deterrent effect.""
Singapore's PCA helped fight corruption rampant during its early years and is seen to have been particularly effective in stamping out public sector corruption.
The major global financial hub and wealth management center has also been successful on cracking down on white-collar financial crime.
In 2016, its central bank shut down two Swiss banks in its biggest crackdown on alleged money-laundering activities connected with Malaysia's scandal-tainted 1MDB fund. 
Authorities have frozen millions of dollars in bank accounts, fined banks and charged several private bankers in connection to the probe.
PROTECTION FOR WHISTLE-BLOWERS 
Legal experts also say a mark of commitment to fight corporate corruption will be to enact an overarching legislation to protect whistleblowers, who are afforded anonymity under the PCA but which can be revoked if the courts believe justice cannot be served without revealing the identity of the informer.
""It depends on the companies to have in place company-specific whistle-blower policies,"" Nizam Ismail, a partner at RHTLaw Taylor Wessing said. 
""When it is only an internal policy, it is not as robust as legislation where the protection is very strong. If you have a whistle-blowing framework, then the message is very clear -- companies must be put on guard or else they will be whistle-blown,"" he added. 

SMU's Tan said Singapore's anti-corruption laws should provide for criminal liability of executives and the board of a company that engages in corruption, if it can be shown that they could have done more to prevent the corrupt practices.

944,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 03:10AM ET</span>",Ship hired to find MH370 arrives in search zone,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A vessel hired to search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 and solve one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries has reached the remote spot in the Indian Ocean where Australian scientists believe the plane went down, Reuters shipping data shows.
Flight MH370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014 with 239 people, mostly Chinese, on board.
Investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off MH370's transponder before diverting it over the Indian Ocean. Debris has been collected from Indian Ocean islands and Africa's east coast and at least three pieces have been confirmed as coming from the missing plane.
Malaysia agreed earlier this month to pay U.S. firm Ocean Infinity up to $70 million if it finds the plane within 90 days. The search vessel, the Seabed Constructor, set off from Durban, South Africa, on Jan. 3.
The vessel is equipped with eight autonomous submersibles that can search a wide area of sea floor much faster than the tethered scanners used in previous searches, Charitha Pattiaratchi, professor of coastal oceanography at the University of Western Australia, told Reuters by phone from Colombo.
""If they don't find anything in the 90 days...I think that would be the end for decades - this is like the final effort, if you like,"" he said.
Reuters data, which is supplied from an automated tracking system, shows the vessel reached the search zone on Sunday and on Tuesday was tracking toward a spot that Australia's scientific agency believes with ""unprecedented precision and certainty"" is the most likely location of the aircraft.
Texas-based Ocean Infinity could not be reached outside business hours at offices in Houston and London.
Australia, Malaysia and China called off their two-year search for the plane a year ago after finding nothing in a 120,000-sq-km underwater search zone.

945,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 03:03AM ET</span>","As U.S. goes quiet on close naval patrols, China speaks out","By Greg Torode and Philip Wen
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - While the Pentagon plays down patrols close to Chinese-controlled reefs and islands in the South China Sea, Beijing is sounding the alarm about them, seeking to justify what experts say will be an even greater presence in the disputed region.
Chinese officials publicized the latest U.S. ""freedom of navigation patrol"", protesting the deployment last week of the destroyer USS Hopper to within 12 nautical miles of Scarborough Shoal, an atoll west of the Philippines which Beijing disputes with Manila.
It was the second time in recent months that confirmation of a patrol came from Beijing, not Washington, which had previously announced or leaked details.
Bonnie Glaser, a security expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said while the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had a policy of keeping the patrols regular but low key, China was willing to publicly exploit them to further their military ends.
""It is difficult to conclude otherwise,"" she said. ""Even as it pushes ahead with these (patrols), I don't think the Trump administration has really come to terms with what it will tolerate from China in the South China Sea, and what it simply won't accept, and Beijing seems to grasp this.""
In official statements, Chinese foreign ministry official Lu Kang said China would take ""necessary measures to firmly safeguard its sovereignty"" in the resource-rich sea.
Some regional diplomats and security analysts believe that will involve increased Chinese deployments and the quicker militarization of China's expanded facilities across the Spratlys archipelago.
While U.S. officials did not target China in their comments, couching freedom-of-navigation patrols as a ""routine"" assertions of international law, Beijing was quick to cast Washington as the provocateur.
The Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper on Monday accused the U.S. of upsetting recent peace and co-operation and ""wantonly provoking trouble"", saying China had must now strengthen its presence in the strategic waterway.
CONSTRUCTION AND MILITARIZATION
In recent years, China has built up several reefs and islets into large-scale airstrips and bases as it seeks to assert and enforce its claims to much of the sea, through which some $3 trillion in trade passes annually. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei, as well as Taiwan, hold rival claims.
Chinese coastguard and People's Liberation Army navy ships patrol vast swathes of the South China Sea, routinely shadowing U.S. and other international naval deployments, regional naval officers say.
Zhang Baohui, a mainland security analyst at Hong Kong's Lingnan University, told Reuters he believed Beijing was rattled by Trump's sharpening Asia strategy and they might be tempted to react in the South China Sea, even after months of relative calm.
""We can perhaps expect the Chinese to push ahead with militarization as retaliation,"" he said.
A new U.S. national defense strategy unveiled last week stressed the need to counter the rising authoritarian powers of China and Russia, outlining a need to better support allies and newer partners against coercion.
While most analysts and regional envoys believe China remains keen to avoid an actual conflict with the significantly more powerful U.S. navy in the South China Sea, it is working to close the gap.
China has added bunkers, hangars and advanced radars on its new runways in the Spratlys, although it has not fully equipped them with the advanced surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles they use to protect the Paracels grouping further north.
Similarly, Beijing has yet to land jet fighters in the Spratlys - test flights some experts are expecting this year.
POTENTIAL FLASHPOINT
The latest patrol was at least the fifth such patrol under the Trump administration and the first to Scarborough - one of the more contentious features in the region.
Scarborough, once a U.S. bombing range, was blockaded by the Chinese in 2012, prompting the Philippines to launch its successful legal case in the Hague against China's excessive territorial claims. 
China allowed Filipino fishermen back to Scarborough's rich waters last year, but it remains a potential flashpoint as both sides claim sovereignty and China maintains a steady presence of ships nearby.
While experts and regional envoys expect China to ramp up operations from the Spratlys, none expect it to build on Scarborough - something widely believed to be a red line that would provoke the United States, given its long-standing security treaty with the Philippines. 
Shi Yinhong, who heads the Center for American Studies at Beijing's Renmin University, said China had ""lived with"" U.S. patrols for several years but the key facts on the ground remained in China's favor and broader tensions had ""improved remarkably"".
""These islands, especially those with reclaimed land and military capability already deployed, they're still in Chinese hands,"" Shi, who has advised the Chinese government on diplomacy, told Reuters. 
""I don't think Trump has the stomach and the guts to change this fundamental status quo.""

946,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 03:00AM ET</span>",Taiwan president says does not exclude possibility of China attack,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said that she does not exclude the possibility of China attacking the self-ruled island, amid heightened tensions between the two sides including an increasing number of Chinese military drills near Taiwan.
Beijing has taken an increasingly hostile stance toward Taiwan, which it considers a breakaway province, since the election two years ago of Tsai of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party.
China suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence, a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing, though she has said she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to ensuring peace.
In recent months, China has stepped up military drills around Taiwan, alarming Taipei. China says the exercises are routine, but that it will not tolerate any attempt by the island to declare independence.
""No one can exclude this possibility. We will need to see whether their policymakers are reasonable policymakers or not,"" Tsai said in an interview on Taiwan television broadcast late on Monday, when asked whether China could attack Taiwan. 
""When you consider it (Taiwan-China relationship) from a regional perspective, any reasonable policymaker will have to very carefully deliberate as to whether launching war is an option,"" Tsai said.  
""When our government faces resistance and pressure from China, we will find our method to resist this. This is very important,"" she added. 
""In terms of China circulating around Taiwan or carrying out other military activities, our military is carefully following every action and movement in the scope of its monitoring,"" Tsai said. ""Our military is very confident to face these situations."" 
China considers proudly democratic Taiwan to be its sacred territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Chinese control.
Taiwan and China have also traded accusations this month about China's opening of new civilian aviation routes close to Taiwan-controlled islands in the Taiwan Strait.
Although China has cut off a formal dialogue mechanism with Taiwan, Tsai acknowledged that both sides currently have a method for communications to avoid misunderstanding.
Taiwan has been pressing for the United States, its main source of arms, to provide more advanced equipment, but has also been trying to bolster its own weapons programs, to avoid what Tsai termed ""certain political difficulties"" that come with buying weapons overseas in the teeth of Chinese opposition.
Tsai said she believed one day Taiwan would be able to produce its own submarines, an item Taipei has long pressed for to face China's navy.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tsai's remarks.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Seoul's presidential Blue House rejected criticism on Tuesday that next month's Winter Games had been hijacked by North Korea, saying the event will help defuse tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Some opposition politicians and conservatives in South Korea have criticized North Korea's participation in the Games to be held in the South Korean alpine resort town of Pyeongchang, dubbing them the ""Pyongyang Olympics"".
""Just one month ago, acute tensions gripped the Korean peninsula, but the administration's efforts to tackle the crisis through dialogue has led to North Korea's participation in the Olympics,"" Blue House spokesman Park Soo-hyun told a news conference. 
""We're confident that the Olympics will be a stepping stone to bring peace to the Korean peninsula, to Northeast Asia and the world.""
After a months-long standoff over the North's nuclear and missile tests, the two Koreas agreed during their first formal talks in nearly two years that the South will help arrange the North to join in the Games. 
Some specific plans, however, including fielding a joint women's ice hockey team and marching under a united flag, have proven controversial, with conservatives and younger South Koreans upset that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is stealing the spotlight.
The administration of South Korea's liberal president, Moon Jae-in, is under pressure over its offer to send athletes to a North Korean ski resort for joint training. Experts say the move risks giving Kim's regime legitimacy and some much needed cash.
Seoul officials are on a three-day trip to the North starting Tuesday to inspect the resort's facilities and the newly built Kalma Airport nearby that may be used to fly in the South Korean skiers, who are not expected to attend the Games.
Moon's approval rating has fallen to a four-month low at 66 percent, a poll showed on Monday, due to a backlash over the decision regarding the combined hockey team.
Small but vocal groups of demonstrators staged a protest at Seoul's central train station on Monday where a North Korean delegation had arrived, burning a picture of Kim. One sign at the protest read: ""We're opposed to Kim Jong Un's Pyongyang Olympics!"". 
North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country, which is in charge of inter-Korean affairs, called the picture-burning protest a ""shuddering, hideous crime"", urging Seoul to apologize and punish those involved. 
""We will never tolerate hideous acts of the conservative hooligans who insulted the sacred dignity and symbol of the DPRK, and the dishonest behavior of the South Korean authorities who connived at such acts"", said a spokesman of the organization via the official KCNA news agency on Tuesday. 
The official was referring to North Korea by its full name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
""We cannot but take a serious consideration of our follow-up measures regarding the Winter Olympics."" 
NEW ANNIVERSARY
Separately, North Korea announced on Tuesday it will mark Feb. 8 as a new anniversary for the founding of its military.
The anniversary, previously held on April 25 and marked with a large military parade, will now take place just one day before the Olympics begins. 
The South Korean military said a detailed analysis is needed to understand the North's intention behind the date change. 
Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at the Sejong Institute south of Seoul, said the anniversary change may be an effort by Kim to distinguish himself from his father and grandfather, emboldened by last year's progress on the nuclear and missile programs. 

""He could also be seeking to steal the show from the South by holding a grand anniversary event just before the Olympics begin, and unveiling weapons like new intercontinental ballistic missiles"", Cheong said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - One man was killed and at least 11 people injured, some critically, when rocks from an erupting volcano rained down on skiers at a mountain resort in central Japan on Tuesday and an avalanche soon after the eruption engulfed about a dozen skiers.
Six of those trapped were members of Japan's Ground Self Defence Force (SDF) engaged in winter training maneuver, Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said. 
All were rescued but most were injured and one of them later died, the Defence Ministry said.
Japanese media reported that at least 12 people were injured, many apparently hit by volcanic rocks. Two were critically injured and three seriously, national broadcaster NHK said.
One person was trapped in the avalanche for some time before being dug out by rescuers, who included SDF members. 
Kusatsu-Shirane, a 2,160-metre (7,090 ft) volcano, erupted on Tuesday morning, the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) said. The agency warned that further eruptions could not be ruled out and that rocks could be thrown as far as 2 km (1 mile) from the peak.
Video footage from the top of the resort's gondola showed skiers gliding down the slopes as black rocks plummeted from the skies and snow billowed up as they struck the ground, sometimes just missing skiers. A cloud of black smoke later drifted in.
""There was this huge boom, and a big plume of totally black smoke rose up,"" one skier told NHK. ""I had absolutely no idea what had happened.""
A photograph taken at the site and shown on NHK depicted a gondola with a shattered window. At least several of the injuries were due to broken glass. 
""Other people appeared to be hurt by the stones, which appeared to be around 10 to 20 cm in size,"" another skier told NHK.
The resort temporarily lost power, leaving a number of skiers suspended in gondolas for around half an hour until they resumed moving. Around 80 skiers at a hut at the top of the mountain were awaiting rescue, which began by helicopter on Tuesday afternoon.
It was unclear whether the avalanche was caused by the volcanic activity but they occurred nearly simultaneously.
The warning level for the peak was raised to 3, meaning that people should not climb the mountain, the JMA said.
Japan has 110 active volcanoes and monitors 47 of them around the clock. In September 2014, 63 people were killed on Mount Ontake, the worst volcanic disaster in Japan for nearly 90 years.

PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - About two thousand people took to the streets of Haiti's capital on Monday to protest comments attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump about the nation being a ""shithole"" country, which caused uproar in the world's first independent black republic.
Trump denied using the word to describe Haiti and African countries during a meeting on immigration earlier this month, but his account was contradicted by others, including Democratic Senator Richard Durbin, who attended the talks.
The reports provoked widespread outrage and fierce criticism globally, and the Haitian demonstrators participating in the first major street protest in the Caribbean nation since Trump's alleged remarks pilloried the U.S. president.
""Trump is a vulgar racist, and a racist is a very poor-minded person,"" said Marvel Joseph, holding a Haitian flag. ""We don't feel any resentment against the American people, who we know largely disapprove of Trump's behavior in the White House.""
Protesters brandished posters of Donald Trump sporting an anus where his mouth was supposed to be, and other caricatures of the president making reference to the body part.
Trump denied being a racist after the controversy broke.
Prominent in the protest were opposition groups critical of President Jovenel Moise, whom they accuse of failing to do enough personally to condemn Trump over the reported comments. Moise too was criticized during the protest.
""Jovenel Moise should step down because he is part of the reason why Trump believes he is allowed to trash talk the country,"" said Stephane Cambry, a supporter of the opposition Pitit Dessalines Party.
Haiti's government condemned the remarks attributed to Trump, as did the Haitian ambassador in Washington.
The demonstration was supposed to end outside the U.S. embassy where organizers planned to make a statement, but they were prevented from accessing the immediate perimeter of the building to avoid potential clashes, police officials said.

Trump's reported comments were roundly condemned in Haiti, though some people declined to participate in the protest arguing that it was a partisan, opposition-sponsored event. The demonstration unfolded without any major incidents.

950,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",More asylum-seekers to leave remote Australian camps for U.S. resettlement: source,"By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Another 58 asylum-seekers held in an Australian-run detention center on Papua New Guinea (PNG) will leave on Tuesday for resettlement in the United States under a controversial refugee swap deal, a source familiar with the plan told Reuters.
The asylum-seekers are the third and largest group to be given U.S. resettlement, ending a three-month hiatus in a transfer program that had been described by U.S. President Donald Trump as a ""dumb"" deal.
Holding asylum-seekers in offshore camps, which have been strongly criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups, is part of a hardline immigration policy that has bipartisan political support in Australia.
Australia agreed on the deal with Trump's predecessor Barack Obama late in 2016, under which up to 1,250 refugees held in the Australian camps will be offered residency. It remains unclear exactly how many will resettled.
In return, Australia agreed to resettle several dozen Central American refugees.
""U.S. resettlements have begun again,"" said a source involved in the transfers, who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to talk to the media.
""While the (plane) wheels are not up yet, the men will depart today,"" he said.
The men departing from PNG's remote Manus Island are largely from countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, along with Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar.
Trump has said he will honor the deal despite his early misgivings.
The deal is designed, in part, to help Australia empty its controversial offshore detention centers, where nearly 2,000 men, women and children are held. The second of the offshore detention camps is on the tiny South Pacific island of Nauru.
A second source said the transfers of about 130 men and women from Nauru would begin within weeks.
Representatives for Peter Dutton, Australia's minister for home affairs that is responsible for immigration policy, did not respond immediately to questions.

Most of those held in the camps traveled on boats from transit countries in Southeast Asia, many after paying people smugglers. Asylum-seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia are sent to the offshore camps and told they will never be settled in Australia.

Hundreds of people have been killed in Xinjiang in the past few years in violence between Uighurs, a mostly Muslim people who speak a Turkic language, and ethnic majority Han Chinese, especially in the heavily Uighur southern part of Xinjiang.
China blames the violence in Xinjiang on Islamist extremists and separatists, some of whom it says have links to groups outside the country.
Rights groups and Uighur exiles say it is more a product of Uighur frustration at Chinese controls on their culture and religion. China denies any repression.
Xinjiang governor Shohrat Zakir said Xinjiang would step up border measures to create a ""Great Wall"", the official China Daily reported.
""We will try our best to leave no gaps or blind spots in social security management and ensure the key areas remain absolutely safe,"" he said at the opening of the regional assembly's annual session.
Technology along the border would be improved and roads and other infrastructure increased, Shohrat Zakir said.
""The overall situation was stable in 2017, which made people feel safer,"" he said. ""We won't allow separatism to stage a comeback and will ensure religious extremism never rises again from the ashes and terrorist attacks are doomed to failure.""
The ""Great Wall"" comments were similar to those President Xi Jinping made last year during the annual session of the country's parliament, where he told Xinjiang lawmakers of the need to build a ""great wall of iron"" to safeguard stability.
Xinjiang has been relatively quiet over the past year or so after a spate of incidents, which has coincided with a massive increase in security, including collecting DNA and other biometric data from the whole population.

952,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>","Hurry up, German conservative urges Social Democrats on coalition","By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN (Reuters) - A leading member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives has urged Social Democrats (SPD) to finish coalition talks within two to three weeks, warning that Germans were losing trust in democracy after months without a new government.
Volker Kauder, who leads conservatives in parliament, rejected calls by Martin Schulz, the embattled leader of the center-left SPD, for revisiting key issues already agreed in a coalition blueprint.
Schulz met with Merkel and the leader of the Bavarian CSU conservatives, Horst Seehofer, on Monday evening for what party sources called ""constructive"" discussions about the way forward on building a new government.
The political blocs are due to meet separately on Tuesday before formal coalition negotiations, which could start later this week. Failure to reach agreement on a coalition could result in a minority government or new elections.
""We should finish the coalition negotiations in two to three weeks,"" Kauder told the Funke Mediengruppe newspaper chain in an interview published on Tuesday. ""The citizens are tired of waiting. Every day that passes without a new government does not exactly increase trust in the parties and democracy.""
A weary Schulz, whose leadership was in play on Sunday, told reporters on Monday that he aimed to build a government that ""improved the lives of the people in this country, but also meets Germany's international commitments, especially with regard to the (European Union) and the unity of Europe.""
Earlier, he said negotiators ""will talk about all the topics we addressed in the exploratory talks again"".
Conservatives reject a wholesale re-look at the blueprint, arguing that it would delay and complicate the negotiations.
""We shouldn't even talk about improvements. The blueprint is the basis for a coalition,"" Kauder told the Funke group.
Only 56 percent of SPD delegates at party congress on Sunday voted to launch formal coalition on the basis of that blueprint.
The narrow victory margin - and continued opposition by the party's youth wing - puts pressure on Schulz to secure further concessions from conservatives on immigration and healthcare, something that conservatives have rejected thus far.
The SPD had wanted to go into opposition instead of redoing the tie-up that ruled Germany the past four years after gaining just 20.5 percent of the vote in September national elections, the worst result for Germany's oldest party since 1933.
DROPPING SUPPORT FOR SPD
A new RTL poll conducted on Monday showed the party's support had dropped a point to 17 percent, just four points ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).
The stakes are high because Schulz has promised that the SPD's 443,000 members will be allowed to vote on a final deal.
For Merkel, a rerun of the conservative-SPD Grand Coalition that has governed Europe's economic powerhouse since 2013, is her best shot at securing a fourth term as chancellor.
She said she looked forward to intensive talks on forming a stable government and her priorities were preserving Germany's economic strength and ensuring social justice and security. 
Investors and partner countries are worried that policymaking in Germany and Europe may become hamstrung by a political deadlock that is about to enter its fifth month. 
Wolfgang Tiefensee, designated leader of the SPD in the eastern state of Thuringia, on Tuesday urged Schulz to stick to his vow to refrain from seeking a ministerial post in a new government.

""An 180-degree pivot on this issue would shatter the credibility of Martin Schulz,"" Tiefensee, a former federal transportation minister, told Die Welt newspaper.

King Mohammed VI named ministers for education, planning, housing, health and for African relations, the statement said.
In October the king had dismissed ministers and top officials after an economic agency found ""imbalances"" in implementing a development plan.
Protests erupted in the Rif region around the northern city of Al-Hoceima in 2016, triggered by the death of a fishmonger whose produce was confiscated by police.
The man's crushing to death in a garbage truck during a confrontation with police became a symbol of corruption and official abuse.
Protests, also fueled by economic underdevelopment, continued there this year.
Political protests are rare in Morocco, where the palace remains the ultimate power.
The protests, the largest in Morocco since the days of the 2011 ""Arab Spring"", were directed at the government and the king's entourage rather than the monarch himself.
Police confiscated fish they said the fishmonger had bought illegally and then dumped it in a garbage truck. Desperate to recover his stock, Fikri jumped inside and was killed by a rubbish crusher.

In July the king pardoned dozens of people arrested in the protests and blamed local officials for failing to quickly implement development projects which stoked public anger.

954,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 05:51PM ET</span>",Brazil holds breath for court ruling on Lula's future,"By Lisandra Paraguassu
PORTO ALEGRE (Reuters) - Brazilian politicians, voters and investors will find out on Wednesday whether an appeals court will allow the country's most popular leader, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, to run for president this year after being found guilty of accepting a bribe.
The former two-term, leftist president was convicted in July of corruption and money laundering for accepting a beachside penthouse apartment from an engineering company vying for government contracts.
If the court's three judges uphold the conviction, which carries a sentence of nine years and six months, Lula would be ineligible to run for re-election on the Oct. 7 ballot and he could be sent to jail.
That would radically alter the political landscape of Brazil ahead of a campaign in which Lula is the early favorite, with 36 percent of voter preferences according to pollster Datafolha. That is double the percentage of his nearest rival, the far-right congressman and former army captain Jair Bolsonaro. 
The case has polarized Brazil, with Lula's critics calling for him to be put behind bars and his Workers Party supporters claiming the charges were trumped up to stop him from running.
The appeals court, known as the TRF-4, has confirmed 95 percent of the convictions and sentences handed down by crusading anti-corruption judge Sergio Moro, who sentenced Lula.
Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index has risen more than 10 percent in the past month on the prospect of Lula being barred from the election sooner than originally expected.
That would improve the odds of a more centrist, market-friendly candidate winning this year's race and continuing austerity policies to reduce a budget deficit run up by Lula's impeached successor, Dilma Rousseff.
Lula, 72, has been touring the country preparing the ground for a presidential bid. CUT, Brazil's largest labor union federation and an ally of the Workers Party, plans to launch his candidacy in Sao Paulo the day after the ruling, whichever way it goes.
The party's leader, Senator Gleisi Hoffmann, went as far as to say last week that authorities would have to ""kill"" people to put Lula in prison, though she later qualified her comment after it created an uproar.
Lula plans to travel to Porto Alegre on Tuesday to rally his supporters, though the court denied his request to address the judges amid criticism he was turning the case into a pulpit for alleging political persecution.
Some 3,000 Lula supporters arrived in the southern city of Porto Alegre on Monday and intend to protest outside the court, which has been cordoned off by police in a four-block radius.
Lula's opponents plan to celebrate in a park on the affluent side of Porto Alegre on Thursday if his conviction is upheld.
INFLUENTIAL POLITICIAN
Despite the conviction and four other corruption probes against him, Lula remains Brazil's most influential politician, loved by Brazilians who benefited from social programs that lifted 30 million people out of poverty during his presidency from 2003 to 2010.
""If Lula is cleared, he will be a strong contender who would certainly reach the second-round runoff,"" said Lucas de Aragão, a political scientist and partner at consultancy Arko Advice in Brasilia. ""But if he is convicted again, the Workers Party will have to get real and find another candidate, because it will be very hard for Lula to get registered to run."" 
For now, the party insists there is no plan B and is casting Lula as a political martyr being illegitimately blocked from the race by Brazilian elites who see him as a threat. 
""Whatever the ruling is on Wednesday, President (Lula) cannot be barred by the appeals court from registering his candidacy,"" his lawyer Cristiano Zanin told foreign news media.
Presidential hopefuls must register with Brazil's electoral authority, the TSE, by Aug. 15. Lula's defense team will try to delay a final decision on his conviction as long as possible to place him on the ballot. 
If an adverse ruling on Wednesday is not unanimous, Lula will have more options for appeals that could delay the process for as long as seven months, legal experts say.
Even if the TSE bars Lula, there is a chance he could appeal to higher courts on constitutional and other grounds to seek an injunction suspending his ineligibility declared by the TSE, said Henrique Neves, a former judge on the electoral court.
If Lula were to run in the elections but lose his case, his votes would be annulled, Neves said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government's aid chief, Mark Green, made an unannounced visit to Raqqa in Syria on Monday, the most senior U.S. civilian official from the Trump administration to visit the war-struck northern city months after it was retaken from Islamic State.
Green was accompanied by head of the U.S. Central Command General Joseph Votel as the United States ramps up post-conflict stabilization in areas where Islamic State has been driven out by American-backed militia.
The visit comes after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last week signaled an open-ended U.S. military presence in Syria, part of a broader strategy to prevent Islamic State's resurgence and pave the way for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step aside.
Lessons from conflicts in Libya and Iraq show that unless liberated areas are quickly stabilized they could easily fall back into the hands of militants.
""We're at the point where people really do want to go home so this is the moment to seize,"" Green, Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), said in a phone interview with Reuters after his seven-hour visit to Raqqa and the Ain Issa camp for people displaced by fighting.
As he drove through the densely built-up city with Votel, Green said he was struck by the devastation to buildings and roads, caused by U.S-led coalition air strikes and militia firing from homes.
""The devastation goes back as far as you can see,"" said Green, ""It is almost beyond description.""
Green said he visited a soccer stadium where locker rooms were used as torture chambers by Islamic State. ""You can see a makeshift metal bed where they laid their torture victims right on the bed. It was just gruesome, gruesome,"" he added.
But there were also signs of hope with fruit vendors on sidewalks, families walking together and people starting to clear rubble.
""Despite all of the destruction and all of the damage you still see signs of the human spirit ... and it gives you so much hope,"" he said. 
NEW FRONT
U.S. forces in Syria have already faced direct threats from Syrian and Iranian-backed forces, leading to the shoot-down of Iranian drones and a Syrian jet last year, as well as to tensions with Russia.
In the meantime, Turkey opened a new front in Syria at the weekend launching airstrikes against U.S.-backed Kurdish militia in Afrin province.
Green said the civilian mission was not to rebuild but to help civilians return home by clearing roadside bombs, and restoring water and electricity.
""The mission for us is stabilization not reconstruction,"" Green emphasized. ""Our part of it is restoring essential services and there is a lot of work to do,"" he added.
Green said he would be traveling to Europe soon to press allies to help.
Fred Hof, director of the Atlantic Council's Rafik Harari Center for the Middle East, said it was critical that the United States ""seals the victory"" in Raqqa through stabilization.
""You don't invest three years in defeating ISIS and then fail to implement an obligatory aspect of military doctrine,"" said Hof. The challenge, he added, was who would be left in command on the ground to ensure rebuilding took place.

Gambia's current President Adama Barrow was sworn in a year ago as a West African regional intervention force closed in on the capital Banjul forcing Jammeh, who had refused to accept his defeat in elections, to flee to Equatorial Guinea. 
Umpa Mendy, Jammeh's principal protection officer, and the former head of the State Guards Battalion Ansumana Tamba had both accompanied the former leader into exile. But the army statement said they flew back into Gambia on Sunday.
""They were arrested at their respective homes ... and are currently detained at the Yundum Military Barracks, where they are helping the military police with their investigations,"" the statement said.
It did not say why the two men returned to Gambia or on what charges they had been arrested. 
Barrow is still seeking to assert control following the end of 22 years of Jammeh's authoritarian rule under which the military served as a key pillar of a regime notorious for jailing and torturing political opponents. 
The new government has replaced or dismissed a number of senior military officers, some of them suspected of being members of a group called the Jungulars, which many Gambians say carried out killings on behalf of the government.
However, the army still contains many former supporters of Jammeh. Barrow's allies have repeatedly warned of the possibility that exiled officers were working to undermine the new government from abroad.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said on Monday it will require six Middle Eastern carriers to undergo enhanced cargo screening as part of an effort to raise global aviation security.
The emergency amendment covers carriers in five countries flying out of seven airports and focuses ""on last points of departure locations where the threat is greatest,"" TSA said in a statement.
It comes as the Trump administration has been working to increase international airport security. 
The carriers and airports are: Egypt Air operating out of Cairo International Airport, Royal Jordanian (AM:RJAL) operating out of Queen Alia International Airport, Saudia operating out of King Abdul-Aziz International Airport and King Khalid International Airport, Qatar Airways operating out of Doha International Airport and Emirates and Etihad operating out of Dubai International Airport and Abu Dhabi International Airport.
All cargo originating from those airports will have to be screened and secured under Air Cargo Advance Screening protocols. The TSA said most of the requirements were already being voluntarily applied by airlines around the world. 
Carriers must submit advance air cargo data to U.S. authorities. The program uses U.S. Department of Homeland Security ""threat information and other data to employ a risk-based approach to improve air cargo security through targeted vetting.""
A Royal Jordanian spokeswoman said the airline had ""received this new amendment from TSA to be implemented on air cargo shipments, and we were given one month period to apply the new amendment.""
Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Saudi Arabian Airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In September, TSA issued a new security directive requiring enhanced screening of cargo from Turkey after an incident in Australia.
In July, an Australian man sent his unsuspecting brother to Sydney airport to catch an Etihad Airways flight carrying a home-made bomb disguised as a meat mincer built at the direction of a senior Islamic State commander. 
High-grade military explosives used to build the bomb were sent by air cargo from Turkey.
In October, new security measures including stricter passenger screening started taking effect on all U.S.-bound flights, including some short security interviews with passengers at check-in or the boarding gate.

In July, the United States lifted restrictions on carry-on electronic devices on planes coming from 10 airports in eight countries in the Middle East and North Africa.

958,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",Body broker who sold diseased remains is convicted of fraud,"By John Shiffman
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Detroit businessman who sold and leased donated body parts for two decades was convicted Monday of defrauding medical customers by selling them diseased human remains.
The case against Arthur Rathburn is part of a growing national investigation by federal authorities into the largely unregulated market for body parts in the United States. Federal agents found a grisly scene when they raided Rathburn’s warehouse in 2013, including remains frozen together flesh on flesh.
Current U.S. laws only regulate body parts intended for transplant, such as hearts and livers. The buying and selling of body parts for research and education -- Rathburn’s line of business -- is legal under U.S. law. He was charged with defrauding clients by selling them body parts infected with HIV and hepatitis without their knowledge.
Rathburn’s ex-wife and business partner, Elizabeth, testified that they bought body parts from companies that encourage people to donate their bodies to science. In an effort to boost profits, she testified, the Rathburns sometimes bought infected bodies and parts, which are sold at discount because few medical entities want them for training or education. 
Elizabeth Rathburn pleaded guilty to fraud, and she cooperated with the prosecution. During testimony before the federal jury in Detroit this month, she said that she expects her sentence will be between four and 10 months. 
Arthur Rathburn, who did not testify at trial, faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, although the U.S. sentencing guidelines the judge must consider generally call for a shorter term. Both are expected to be sentenced in the spring.
Rathburn was convicted on seven counts of fraud and acquitted of two counts of fraud. His lawyers had contended that the case focused on contract disputes with his customers over the quality of his products and ought to be brought in civil court, not criminal court.
""There are no industry regulations regarding the business Arthur Rathburn was engaged in,"" his defense lawyers argued in a court filing. ""Industry standards and what constitutes a 'clean' environment are subjective matters, not a matter for criminal prosecution."" 
Reuters reported last month that authorities found four fetuses, each in its second trimester, during the warehouse raid. It is illegal to sell fetuses. Rathburn was not charged with doing so, and it’s unclear how the fetuses were acquired. Officials and defense lawyers have declined to comment on the matter. The discovery of the fetuses, however, may be raised during the sentencing phase. 
The government’s failure to stop Rathburn sooner, despite a decade of warning signs, was one in a series of stories Reuters published last year about the industry. https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/usa-bodies/
As part of the series, a reporter purchased two human heads and a spine from a broker in Tennessee, deals made with just a few emails at a cost of $900, plus shipping.
The series also profiled two Phoenix brokers -- one who earned at least $12 million from the sale or use of donated body parts and one who pleaded guilty to defrauding customers. The latter, Steve Gore, cooperated with the government and testified against Rathburn in the Detroit trial. He told the jury that he “made mistakes” while operating a business that harvested 5,000 bodies in a decade, but said that he had no state or federal regulations to guide him. 
A Reuters story in December described how Gore’s technicians dismembered bodies with construction saws purchased from  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD). Under cross-examination, Gore was asked if he used the construction saw instead of a proper medical instrument because it was cheaper.

Yes, Gore nodded, adding, “and effective.”

The ELN and the Gulf Clan, founded by former right-wing paramilitaries, are fighting over drug production previously controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels, who demobilized last year after a peace deal.
""Five armed subjects entered and shot patrons and caused the death of seven people,"" Carlos Mauricio Sierra, police commander for the province, told reporters on Monday. The incident took place in the mountainous Yarumal municipality.
In the nearby municipality of Caceres, hundreds of people were displaced from their homes over the weekend by fighting between illegal armed groups, Antioquia's provincial government said on its website.
The ELN, FARC dissidents who refused to demobilize and crime gangs are also involved in illegal mining of gold, extortion and other crimes. The government has sent thousands of additional soldiers to troubled areas in a bid to improve security.
The ELN is holding peace talks with the Colombian government in Quito, but the talks were recently interrupted when the group stepped up its attacks after the end of a ceasefire.
The Gulf Clan has repeatedly expressed a desire to come to a surrender agreement with Colombia's government, which has said it will not negotiate with criminal groups.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",'Put Trump in his place': nationalism awakens in Mexican presidential race,"By Dave Graham
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Donald Trump's habit of slapping down Mexico is feeding nationalist sentiment in the country's presidential election campaign, prompting contenders to defy him and strengthening the hand of the frontrunner, who is courting the anti-establishment vote. 
In the past week, the three top contenders for the July election have all said Mexico will not pay for the wall the U.S. president wants to build on the U.S. southern border. None has made the point more forcefully than Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a veteran leftist leading the opinion polls.
A victory for Lopez Obrador, who was runner-up in 2006 and 2012, could usher in a more distant and confrontational relationship between the two nations as he promises to lessen Mexico's economic dependence on foreign powers.
That dependence is strongest with the United States: Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to its northern neighbor and the United States has traditionally been the source of the bulk of foreign direct investment. Under Trump, however, Mexican views of the United States have soured.
""Without being disrespectful, we're going to put him in his place,"" Lopez Obrador said of Trump on Thursday in the Gulf of Mexico port of Veracruz, the scene of a notorious national humiliation when U.S. forces occupied it in 1914.
Earlier that day, Trump told his Twitter followers that Mexico was ""rated the number one most dangerous country in the world."" Although violence is rising in Mexico, its murder rate remains well below that of several Latin American countries, data compiled by the United Nations and the World Bank show.
Lopez Obrador, who said earlier this month he would put an end to what he called puppet governments in Mexico taking instructions ""from abroad,"" promised to hit back against Trump's barbs and tell the American ""what I think"" on Twitter.
A December survey by polling firm Parametria gave Lopez Obrador an 11 percentage point lead, while another last week by Mitofsky gave him a three point advantage, but growing.
Since taking office a year ago, Trump has often expressed negative views of Mexico, blaming it for drugs entering the United States, criticizing U.S. companies with operations south of the border, and insisting Mexico will pay for the wall he wants to stop illegal immigration. He has threatened to tie payment to the terms under which the two neighbors trade by reworking or canceling the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Each time, President Enrique Pena Nieto's government has pushed back.
This week presidential hopeful Ricardo Anaya of the conservative National Action Party (PAN), who heads a left-right coalition, and the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's (PRI) contender, Jose Antonio Meade, also weighed in.
""Mexico will NOT under any circumstances pay for that wall,"" Meade said on Twitter on the day Lopez Obrador was in Veracruz.
Few issues unite Mexicans more than dislike of Trump, who kicked off his presidential bid in 2015 by accusing the country of sending rapists and drug runners across the U.S. border.
Jorge Buendia of pollster Buendia & Laredo said Trump had made it advantageous for Mexican politicians to criticize him, and that it would be ""very costly"" for the next president to extend the hand of friendship towards his government.
""So it's only a matter of time before there are much more critical proposals about Trump and U.S. relations,"" he said.
The most obvious beneficiary of opposition to Trump, at least initially, would be Lopez Obrador, Buendia said.
'ANGER AMONG MEXICANS'
A study published last week featuring data from the Pew Research Center and Buendia & Laredo showed that since Trump entered presidential politics, the image of the United States has deteriorated sharply in Mexico.
In 2015, 66 percent of Mexicans held a favorable view of the United States and 29 percent an unfavorable opinion, it showed. By October 2017, 65 percent of Mexicans had an unfavorable view of the United States and only 30 percent a positive one.
Heriberto Galindo, a former PRI congressman and ex-consul general of Mexico in Chicago, said Trump would end up unifying the rhetoric of all the presidential candidates against him.
""I'm not saying we're heading for war with the United States, because Mexico is pacifist,"" he said. ""But President Donald Trump is causing a lot of anger among Mexicans ... and a negative attitude towards the United States, which is not helpful, beneficial or healthy, least of all with a neighboring country.""
Anti-Trump feeling is only likely to intensify if the president follows through on threats to dump NAFTA, which underpins much of Mexico's trade, if it is not reworked to better favor U.S. interests. Negotiators hold another round of talks this week to try to overhaul the deal.
Agustin Barrios Gomez, a former federal congressman and head of Fundacion Imagen Mexico, a group dedicated to promoting Mexico's image abroad, argued Lopez Obrador does not even need to sharpen his rhetoric to benefit from Trump, because he has no credible rivals to oppose his nationalist arguments.
Both Meade and Anaya represent parties that defended closer economic integration and cooperation with the United States and are the only ones to have held power, Barrios Gomez noted.
Now Trump's hostility has shattered that model, he added.

""The feeling's there: you trusted these guys (the United States), and they turned on you like the left have been saying for God knows how long,"" he said. ""And that plays to Andres Manuel's strengths because he doesn't have to say anything.""

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani student shot and killed his school principal on Monday, in a dispute over the student skipping classes to attend rallies supporting the country's strict blasphemy laws, a police official said. 
Sareer Ahmed, principal of the private Islamia College in the northern town of Charsadda, had an argument with one of his students for missing a number of classes. The student then shot the principal on campus, local police chief Zahoor Afridi told Reuters.  
He said the unnamed student had attended a sit-in staged by a new ultra-religious political party, Tehreek-e-Labaik, late last year to oppose a small change in wording to an electoral law, which it said amounted to blasphemy. 
The protest, which brought the capital Islamabad to a standstill, ended in clashes between police and demonstrators that killed seven people and injured over 200. It also led the government to back down and accept the resignation of a minister accused of blasphemy.
""Obviously now he is going to say that he (the principal) committed blasphemy. This is a very unfortunate incident,"" Afridi added.
Insulting Islam's prophet is punishable by death under Pakistani law, and blasphemy accusations stir such emotions that they are difficult to defend against. Even a rumor of blasphemy can spark mob violence.
Police have taken the student, who appeared in photographs and video to be 16 or 17 years old, into custody and filed a first information report against him.
In a video recorded during the arrest, the student can be heard defending his actions in Pashto, a regional language.
""I committed this murder and I accepted it. It was ordered by God,"" he proclaimed.
There was widespread outrage across Pakistan last April when student Mashal Khan was beaten to death at his university in Mardan following a dormitory debate about religion.
Police arrested 57 people, including students and some faculty members, in connection with the killing.
There have been at least 67 murders over unproven allegations of blasphemy since 1990, according to figures from a research center and independent records kept by Reuters.
In 2011, a bodyguard assassinated Punjab provincial governor Salman Taseer after he called for the blasphemy laws to be reformed. Taseer's killer, executed last year, has been hailed as a martyr by religious hardliners.

It said some of the treaty's clauses raised concern about the future of European Christian civilization, importing alien values from a godless society.
Earlier this month the center-right government led by Prime Minister Boyko Borissov submitted the Council of Europe convention for ratification in the parliament in a move that divided opinions in the European Union’s poorest country, which now holds the EU's rotating presidency for the first time since it joined the bloc in 2007.
The 81-article document, also known as the Istanbul Convention, is intended to reinforce measures to protect women from violence. Some 28 countries ratified the treaty, which has been signed by 45 countries, including Bulgaria.
The Bulgarian Church, however, has joined the chorus against ratification, saying it is opening the door to moral decay. It said the document opposes the basic beliefs of the Bulgarian people about faith, nationality, morality, honor, dignity, education and family.
""It is a tool that instills a value system that is unfamiliar to us in order to allow society to be governed by a new model in the interests of a small part of it,"" the Church’s Holy Synod, its top executive body, said in a statement.
Junior coalition partner United Patriots, an alliance of three nationalist parties, and the Socialist Party - the largest opposition party in the Balkan country, have joined forces to oppose the cabinet's decision while populist Will said some texts should be removed.
But Tsvetan Tsvetanov, the head of the ruling GERB party's parliamentary group, it was an EU commitment and would not bring the coalition down.
The Church said the treaty opens the door to spiritual death and is totally opposed to Christianity.
""It raises concerns about the future of the European Christian civilization because it contains a new understanding of man - man as an absolute master, the man without God who follows his desires and passions to such an extent that he can even determine his gender,"" the Holy Synod said.
""The consequences of denying biblical truths are tragic and we are witnessing them in many societies where ""gender"" ideology has long been a state policy,"" the church said.
Around 80 percent of Bulgarians identify themselves as Orthodox Christians - the mainstream religion also in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Greece, Romania and Serbia. But only a few see church-going as important to their lives.
Trust in the Orthodox Church was shaken after a history commission showed a few years ago that many bishops collaborated with the former communist era secret police.

965,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Pakistani PM says 'committed' to seizing Islamist charities,"By Drazen Jorgic and Kay Johnson
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Monday said his government will push ahead with plans to seize control of charities run by an Islamist designated a terrorist by Washington, and warned the United States not to weaken Pakistan.
Abbasi brushed off U.S. President Donald Trump's recent tweet accusing Pakistan of ""lies and deception"" in its commitment to fighting terrorism, as he raised the prospect of charging the United States to use Pakistan's airspace to resupply NATO troops in Afghanistan.
Under pressure from the United States and international institutions to crack down on terrorist financing, Pakistan last month drew up secret plans for a ""takeover"" of charities linked to Islamist leader Hafiz Saeed, who Washington blames for the 2008 attacks in Mumbai that killed 166 people.
The United States has labeled the charities Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and the Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation (FIF) as ""terrorist fronts"" for Lashkar-e-Taiba (LET), or ""Army of the Pure"", a group Saeed founded in 1987 and which Washington and India accuse of carrying out the Mumbai attacks.
Saeed has repeatedly denied involvement in the Mumbai attacks and says the charitable organizations he founded and controls have no ties with militants.
But both he and the organizations have been sanctioned by the United Nations and his freedom in Pakistan, where he holds public rallies, has been a thorn in Islamabad's relations with India and the United States.
""Yes, the government will take over the charities which are sanctioned and not allowed to operate,"" Abbasi, 59, told Reuters in an interview at the prime minister's chamber in Pakistan's Parliament in capital Islamabad.
Answering specific questions about the proposed takeover of JuD and FIF, Abbasi said the civilian government had the backing of the powerful military, which effectively controls Pakistan's security and foreign policy.
""Everybody is on board, everybody is on the same page, everybody is committed to implementation of U.N. sanctions,"" he said.
He declined to set a deadline.
JuD and FIF did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. The organizations have previously said they would take legal action if the government tried to take them over. Saeed could not be reached for comment.
SELECTIVE ACTION
There are concerns in Pakistan that the country may face financial sanctions over accusations of selective action against Islamist militant groups and financing.
Pakistan is a base for myriad Islamist movements, and critics accuse Islamabad of only targeting militants who attack the state while leaving unscathed those who target neighboring Afghanistan and arch-foe India. Pakistan denies those allegations.
Abbasi said Pakistan had made progress in curbing terrorist financing after meetings with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international body that warned Islamabad could be put on a watchlist for not doing enough to stop the practice. 
""We've had several meetings on that, and from what I've seen a large part of those actions have been taken,"" Abbasi said.
A U.N. Security Council team is due to visit Pakistan this month to review progress against U.N.-designated ""terrorist"" groups, which includes LeT and others such as the Afghan Taliban-allied Haqqani network.
Former petroleum minister Abbasi said any sanctions against Pakistan would be counter-productive to the country's own battle against Islamist militants, which he called ""the largest war on terror in the world"".
""Any constraints put on Pakistan, actually only serve to degrade our capability to fight the war against terror,"" he said.
TRUMP MEETING
Relations between the United States and its uneasy ally have frayed since Jan. 1, when Trump lashed out against what he called Pakistan's ""lies and deceit"" over its alleged support of Afghan Taliban militants battling U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Washington has since suspended aid totaling about $2 billion.
Abbasi said Trump's tweet was ""unacceptable"" in its tone and that Pakistan should not be ""scapegoated"" for U.S. failures in Afghanistan.
""That is something ... we cannot accept because nobody's suffered more than Pakistan,"" Abbasi said, adding that tens of thousands of Pakistani have died from militancy that has inflicted damage worth $120 billion to the economy. 
U.S. officials last year warned of tougher measures against Pakistan, including potentially withdrawing its ""non-Nato ally"" status or even designating it a state sponsor of terrorism. 
Abbasi said much of the suspended aid was from the Coalition Support Fund (CSF), a U.S. Defence Department program to reimburse allies for the costs of supporting counter-terrorist and counter-insurgency operations.
He said the U.S. needed to respect Pakistan's contribution to the fight against Islamist militancy and raised the prospect of charging Washington for air transport flights that have been resupplying U.S.-led troops and Afghan forces in landlocked Afghanistan.
""If somebody wants to start quantifying expenses and aid, I think let's put this on the table also. Let's discuss that,"" Abbasi said, though he added that such talk was ""hypothetical"".
Abbasi dismissed media reports that Islamabad has ended intelligence sharing with the U.S. military as false.
And he also spoke fondly about a brief discussion he had with Trump in September at a reception at the U.N General Assembly in New York.

""I found him to be fairly warm,"" he said. ""Somebody that you would like to engage with and talk to.""

966,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Turkey expects swift campaign against U.S.-backed Kurds in Syria,"By Mert Ozkan
HASSA, Turkey (Reuters) - Turkey shelled targets in northwest Syria on Monday and said it would swiftly crush U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG fighters in an air and ground offensive on the Afrin region beyond its border.
The three-day-old campaign has opened a new front in Syria's multi-sided civil war, realigning a battlefield where outside powers are supporting local combatants.
While Washington and other Western capitals expressed concern, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he had secured a go-ahead for the campaign from Russia, principal backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, long Turkey's foe.
Turkish forces and their Syrian anti-Assad rebel allies began their push on Saturday to clear the northwestern border enclave of Kurdish YPG fighters. Ankara considers the YPG to be allies of insurgents that have fought against the Turkish state for decades. The United States, meanwhile, has armed and aided the YPG as its main ground allies against Islamic State.
France called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Monday, and Britain said it would look for ways to prevent any further escalation. 
But Erdogan said Turkey was determined to press ahead. ""There's no stepping back from Afrin,"" he said in a speech in Ankara. ""We discussed this with our Russian friends, we have an agreement with them, and we also discussed it with other coalition forces and the United States.""
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington had proposed working with Turkey and forces on the ground in Afrin to ""see how we can stabilize this situation and meet Turkey's legitimate concerns for their security.""
But Turkey said Washington must end its support for the Kurdish YPG militia before any proposal for cooperation: ""If they want a cooperation, we are ready for this cooperation. As the first step to take, they can stop arming terror groups and take back weapons already given,"" Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag told reporters after a cabinet meeting.
Syria has objected to the Turkish incursion, and Moscow, which controls parts of Syrian air space on behalf of its allies in Damascus, has not confirmed giving a green light to it. But Russia does not appear to be acting to prevent it, and has pulled its own troops out of the Afrin area.
Iran, Assad's other main military supporter, called for a halt to the operation. Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said the Afrin campaign could lead to ""the return of regional terrorism and extremism"", according to state television.
The YPG's Afrin spokesman, Birusk Hasaka, said there were clashes between Kurdish and Turkish-backed forces on the third day of the operation, and that Turkish shelling had hit civilian areas in Afrin's northeast.
Afrin would be a ""quagmire from which the Turkish army will only exit after suffering great losses"", said a statement from the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces umbrella group.
The YPG said Afrin had already been reinforced in anticipation of the Turkish offensive, and there were discussions over whether to send more reinforcements from other YPG-held territory, which is separated from Afrin by areas held by Syrian government forces. 
The United Nations has said it is deeply concerned for the more than 300,000 people in Afrin. Spokeswoman Linda Tom said there were reports of people displaced within Afrin by the fighting, and of smaller numbers heading to nearby Aleppo.
U.S.-TURKEY TENSION
Ankara has been infuriated by U.S. support for the YPG, one of several issues that have brought relations between the United States and its Muslim NATO ally close to breaking point.
Erdogan has also pledged to drive the SDF from the town of Manbij to the east, part of a much larger area of northern Syria controlled by the YPG-led SDF. That raises the prospect of protracted conflict between Turkey and its allied Free Syrian Army factions against the U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters.
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek played down the long-term risks: ""Our investors should be at ease, the impact will be limited, the operation will be brief and it will reduce the terror risk to Turkey in the period ahead,"" he said.
A senior Turkish official declined to give a timeframe but said the operation would ""move fast"", adding that Turkey believed there was some local support for its action in both Afrin and Manbij.
YPG official Nouri Mahmoud said Turkish-backed forces had not taken any territory in Afrin. ""Our forces have to this point repelled them and forced them to retreat,"" he told Reuters. 
A Turkish official said Turkish troops and allied Free Syrian Army fighters had begun to advance on Afrin's eastern flank, taking control of a hill northwest of the town of Azaz. An FSA commander later told Reuters YPG forces had recaptured the summit of Barshah hill. 
TURKISH SHELLING
A Reuters cameraman near Hassa, across the border from Afrin, saw Turkish shelling on Monday morning. Dogan news agency said Turkish howitzers opened fire at 1 a.m. (2200 GMT), and that YPG targets were also being hit by Turkish warplanes and multiple rocket launchers.
Turkey sees the YPG presence on its southern border as a domestic security threat. Defeating it in Afrin would reduce Kurdish-controlled territory on its frontier and link up two regions controlled by insurgents opposed to Assad - Idlib province and an area where Turkey fought for seven months in 2016-17 to drive back Islamic State and the YPG.
The Turkish-backed FSA factions, which have come together under the banner of a newly branded ""National Army"", also want to see an end to YPG rule in Afrin. They accuse the YPG of displacing 150,000 Arab residents of towns including Tel Rifaat and Menigh to the east of Afrin, captured in 2016.
""This is a historic moment in our revolution,"" Mohammad al-Hamadeen, a senior officer in the FSA forces, told fighters in Azaz on Sunday as they prepared to join the ground offensive.
""God willing, very soon we will return to our region that we were driven from two years ago.""

GAZA (Reuters) - The head of the U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees said on Monday that U.S. plans to cut funding to the body were abrupt and harmful and risked destabilizing the Middle East.
Pierre Krähenbühl, commissioner-general of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), visited the Gaza Strip on the same day that U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem that the U.S. would move its embassy there by the end of 2019.
The United States, by far the largest contributor to UNRWA, announced on Jan. 16 that Washington will withhold $65 million of $125 million that it had planned to send to UNRWA this year. UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions from U.N. member states.
(Graph of funding for Palestinian refugee relief: http://reut.rs/2CN66gl) 
U.S. President Donald Trump questioned the value of such funding, and the State Department said the agency needed to make unspecified reforms.
In Gaza to launch a global funding appeal to keep UNRWA's schools and clinics open through 2018 and beyond, Krähenbühl said the American cuts would cause difficulties for the agency.
""The reduction is a very severe one, it is abrupt and is harmful,"" said Krähenbühl.
""The world has to ask itself this question: does the Middle East need more instability? Is it reasonable to think that by reducing amounts to UNRWA one is achieving anything else but greater instability in the region?""
More than half of the two million people in Gaza are dependent on support from UNRWA and other humanitarian agencies. Palestinians say the funding decision could deepen hardship in the Gaza Strip, where the unemployment rate is 46 percent.
UNRWA was established by the U.N. General Assembly in 1949 after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war that followed Israel’s creation.
Around 525,000 boys and girls in 700 UNRWA schools could be affected by the U.S. fund cut, Krähenbühl told Reuters while visiting a girls' school in Gaza City. Palestinian access to primary health care could also be impacted. 
""I can't imagine to come to this school or to any other school in UNRWA in few weeks and say to the students, 'Sadly we failed.' Failing is not an option,"" Krähenbühl said.
Washington gave $355 million to UNRWA in the 2017 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, U.S. officials say.
In a Twitter post on Jan. 2, Trump said that the U.S. gives the Palestinians ""HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect."" Trump added that ""with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?""
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has called for a gradual cut in UNRWA funding and for its responsibilities to be transferred to the U.N. global refugee agency UNHCR, has voiced measured support for the U.S. fund cut.

But Netanyahu has also appeared to acknowledge that it could leave Israel - which maintains tight restrictions on the movement of people and goods across its border with Gaza - with a potential humanitarian crisis on its doorstep.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) is in the process of deciding whether to cut short President Jacob Zuma's tenure as head of state, the party's secretary general told a news conference on Monday.
The announcement is a fresh blow to Zuma who has seen his power within the party wane since Cyril Ramaphosa succeeded him as ANC leader at an election last month, putting the deputy president in pole position to become national leader.
Zuma has ruled since 2009 and is due to step down after elections next year but senior ANC leaders say Ramaphosa wants him out before that and Ramaphosa himself has said the question of the president's tenure would be addressed.
""We have not arrived at the decision that Zuma must go, or Zuma must not go,"" ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule told a news conference on the outcome of a four-day ANC meeting that ended on Sunday.
""Officials were seized with this matter and officials will remain seized with this matter,"" he said, adding that Ramaphosa would ""continuously interact"" with Zuma over his future as president.
Zuma could be removed through a motion of no confidence in parliament or by the ANC's National Executive Committee. There was no immediate comment from Zuma's spokesman.
Zuma's departure would make it easier for Ramaphosa to revitalize the economy and tackle corruption.
It could also boost the party's electoral chances next year because it would no longer be so closely associated with Zuma's legacy. The ANC has held power since it won an election at the end of apartheid in 1994, but it now faces a revitalized opposition and could be set for a tough battle next year.
Economic growth has slowed to a near-standstill under Zuma's leadership and his tenure has been tainted by a series of corruption accusations, which he denies. Ramaphosa campaigned for ANC leader on a pledge to tackle government corruption. 
Financial markets have warmed to Ramaphosa's pledges to kick-start economic growth and root out corruption, with the rand hitting a new 2-1/2 year high on Monday on hopes that Zuma will leave power soon.
Zuma still retains the support of a faction within the ANC, but several prominent allies have deserted him since December.
Authorities said last week they had been granted authority to freeze millions of dollars worth of assets belonging to companies controlled by the Gupta brothers, who are friends of Zuma's.
The decision is part of a judicial campaign against corruption but is also seen as damaging to Zuma because of his association with the Guptas.
Ramaphosa is this week leading South Africa's delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos.

""Zuma is in a corner and neutralized,"" said Professor Susan Booysen at Wits University's School of Governance. ""When Ramaphosa returns from Davos I think he will be able to dictate terms to Zuma about his exit.""

However, the administration of President Abdulla Yameen said Nasheed, who has been in exile on medical grounds from a 13-year jail sentence, should name the islands grabbed by China if he knew of any land grabbing.
The island nation has been mired in political unrest since its first democratically elected leader Nasheed was ousted in 2012. He was later sentenced to 13 years in jail on terrorism charges after a trial denounced as hasty and unfair by the United Nations human rights chief.
""There is land grab going on that threatens not just the Maldives, but the peace and the stability of the entire region. A large, emerging power is busy buying up the Maldives,"" Nasheed told reporters in Colombo. When asked to name the power to which he was referring, he said: ""China"".
""None of these agreements are transparent. They did not go through the proper tendering process and therefore the actual figures we must learn. I'm very sure about the process of land grab,"" he when asked about the extent of the land grab by China.
He said at least 16-17 small islands had been seized, though he did not name any of them or give an idea of the amount of territory grabbed by China. 
""It always starts with a real estate project, but it can be turned into something (else) ... that China has actually grabbed more land.""
Mohamed Hussain Shareef, Maldives ambassador to Sri Lanka responding to Nasheed's allegation, said the archipelago's constitution prevents anybody owning land in the Indian Ocean island nation without large investments behind them. 
""Investors can own land only by investing over $1 billion according to a law enacted two years back. Nobody has invested that amount so far. In terms of leasing, Chinese companies would have leased a handful of resorts, less than those leased by Thailand,"" he told Reuters.
""If Nasheed says 16-17 islands, he should name at least one island which is grabbed by China."" 
Nasheed is not eligible to contest the 2018 presidential poll as he was arrested under an anti-terrorism law. He would require a presidential pardon to do so, but he needs to serve one-third of his 13-year sentence, legal experts say. 
Nasheed once held an underwater cabinet meeting during his 2008-12 tenure to bring global attention to focus on the impact of climate change on the Maldives.
He has sought U.N. help to restore his political rights, which he says were removed illegally on trumped up terrorism charges.
He expects to contest the 2018 presidential elections once his political rights restored.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union assured President Mahmoud Abbas it supported his ambition to have East Jerusalem as capital of a Palestinian state, in the bloc's latest rejection of U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
At a meeting in Brussels with EU foreign ministers, Abbas repeated his call for East Jerusalem as capital as he urged EU governments to recognise a state of Palestine immediately, arguing that this would not disrupt negotiations with Israel on a peace settlement for the region.
While Abbas made no reference to Trump's move on Jerusalem or U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's visit to the city on Monday, his presence at the EU headquarters in Brussels was seized on by European officials as a chance to restate opposition to Trump's Dec. 6 decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.
Mogherini, in what appeared to be a veiled reference to Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel, called on those involved in the process to speak and act ""wisely"", with a sense of responsibility.
""I want to reassure President Abbas of the firm commitment of the European Union to the two-state solution with Jerusalem as the shared capital of the two states,"" Mogherini said.
Before Abbas' arrival, she was more outspoken, saying: ""Clearly there is a problem with Jerusalem. That is a very diplomatic euphemism,"" in reference to Trump's position.
But Mogherini said she still wanted to work with the United States on Middle East peace talks and had discussed ways to restart them late last year with Pence and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. 
She played down the timing of the vice president's visit to Israel when Abbas was in Brussels, saying it was a coincidence.
Deputy German Foreign Minister Michael Roth told reporters that Trump's decision had made peace talks harder but said all sides needed to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Abbas also struck a more diplomatic tone than in his recent public remarks, including earlier this month when he said he would only accept a broad, internationally-backed panel to broker any peace talks with Israel.
""We are keen on continuing the way of negotiations,"" Abbas said. ""We are determined to reunite our people and our land.""
In another gesture of support, EU foreign ministers discussed whether to increase the EU's aid to the Palestinian Authority, after the United States said last week it would withhold about half the initial aid it planned to give the U.N. agency that serves the Palestinians. No decisions were taken. 
But Abbas' call for the European Union to immediately and officially recognise the state of Palestine won little support in the lunch meeting, diplomats said.
SLOVENIAN DECISION?
While nine EU governments including Sweden and Poland already recognise Palestine, the 28-nation bloc says such recognition must come as part of a peace settlement.
Only Slovenia has recently raised the possibility of recognising the state of Palestine. A parliamentary committee there is due to consider the issue on Jan. 31, but it remains unclear when the parliament could recognise Palestine.
That reflects the European Union's dual role as the Palestinians' biggest aid donor and Israel's biggest trade partner, even if EU governments reject Israeli settlements on land Israel has occupied since a 1967 war - including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. 
The European Union also wants the Palestinians to remain open to a U.S.-led peace plan, expected to be presented soon by Jason Greenblatt, Trump's Middle East envoy and Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. 
Abbas said there was ""no contradiction between recognition (of Palestine) and the resumption of (peace) negotiations.""
Instead, France wants to push the European Union to offer closer trade ties through a so-called EU association agreement, an EU treaty covering unfettered access to the bloc's 500 million consumers, aid and closer political and cultural ties.
""We want to say to Mahmoud Abbas that we want to move ... towards an association agreement and to start the process already,"" said France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.
But offering an EU association agreement to the Palestinians was also fraught with difficulties, while Germany's Roth expressed some reservation in the closed-door meeting and Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the EU would need to offer something similar to Israel, diplomats said. 

Under EU rules, the agreements need to be agreed with sovereign states. France argues that the EU has an association agreement with Kosovo, whose independence is not recognised by all countries, including EU member Spain.

A memo from the prosecutor's office said the case raised against Hanafi had been closed as of Dec. 12, 2017, and that criminal accusations relating to misuse of public funds had been dropped.
Hanafi was in charge of the country's state grain buyer, the General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC), when a parliamentary investigation in 2016 suggested that millions of dollars intended to subsidize farmers were used to purchase wheat that did not exist. 
He resigned in August 2016 amid a separate controversy over whether he was using state funds to pay for posh hotel stays, which he denied. 
Hanafi was never directly charged with complicity in the procurement scandal, but parliamentarians who opened a wide-reaching probe into the fraud and industry officials pinned much of the blame on his administration. He has denied any wrongdoing.
A Reuters special report that preceded the parliamentary probe detailed how the government's wheat supply chain had been riddled with corruption that was costing the country hundreds of millions of dollars per year. 
Lawmakers who formed a fact-finding commission to investigate the scandal said upwards of 2 million tonnes, or 40 percent of the locally procured crop in 2016 may have been missing. 

Egypt procured about 3.4 million tonnes of wheat in last year's harvest, the first after new measures were implemented to prevent the previous year's fraud.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - At least seven people died after clashes broke out between security forces and worshippers taking part in a religious ceremony marking Epiphany in northern Ethiopia over the weekend, officials said.
Authorities in the Horn of Africa country's Amhara region said they were yet to determine the causes of the violence that first erupted on Saturday in the town of Woldiya, more than 500 kilometers north of the capital Addis Ababa.
""Attempts to unblock roads and prevent the destruction of property are still ongoing. The situation has improved (since Sunday) but we are still having to undertake such measures,"" said Amare Goshu, a police commissioner of the district.
One member of security forces deployed to quell the violence was among the dead, he said. Orthodox Christians use Epiphany celebrations to mark the baptism of Jesus Christ.
It was not immediately clear if the violence is related to unrest that plagued the country in 2015 and 2016.
In Ethiopia's central Oromiya province, hundreds were killed over that period in violence triggered by allegations of land grabs, with protests then broadening into demonstrations over political restrictions and perceived rights abuses.
Protests had also previously taken place in the Amhara region, with dozens dying in violence sparked by a territorial dispute.
Ethiopia is a Western ally against Islamist militants in neighboring Somalia and an economic power seen as a center of relative stability in a fragile region.
The government in Addis Ababa has sought to calm political turmoil by announcing reforms and releasing dissidents. Last week, a senior opposition leader jailed for collusion with anti-government rebel groups was freed alongside 114 other inmates.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Monday he would explore deepening defense ties during a visit to Indonesia, a country that appears increasingly ready to assert its sovereignty in the contested South China Sea.
Mattis, ahead of talks in Jakarta, raised the possibility of greater maritime cooperation. An aide noted that Indonesia was also considering purchasing  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Corp's F-16 fighter jets, in a deal that could be worth billions.
""This is a very strategic partnership,"" Mattis said, noting Indonesia was the world's third largest democracy and the most populous Muslim-majority nation. It is also a vast archipelago of over 17,000 islands, with a strategic maritime reach.
""We're going to continue our efforts to expand maritime cooperation but also support Indonesia as a sort of fulcrum between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean,"" Mattis told reporters traveling with him.
Indonesia has clashed with China over fishing rights around the Natuna Islands, detaining Chinese fishermen and expanding its military presence in the area in recent years. 
In July, Indonesia renamed the northern reaches of its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea as the North Natuna Sea, a move seen as a significant act of resistance to China's territorial ambitions in the South China Sea.
After Indonesia, Mattis is expected to travel to Vietnam, which has emerged as the most vocal opponent of China's expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea, where more than $3 trillion in cargo passes every year.

The United States and its allies oppose China's building of artificial islands in the South China Sea and their militarization, given concerns Beijing might use them to deny access to strategic routes vital to commerce.
Mattis, in comments that appeared directed at China, said the United States wanted to make sure that bigger nations did not impose their will on smaller nations.
""Every nation matters and there should not be any bullying or shredding of trust toward others,"" he said.
Mattis kicked off his trip by meeting Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi shortly after landing in Jakarta late on Monday. He was expected to meet other senior Indonesian officials on Tuesday. 
Joe Felter, a deputy assistant secretary of defense, noted that the Pentagon had recently singled out China in a strategy document unveiled last week. 
""I think they (the Chinese) have a coherent long-term strategy to exert influence, if not dominate the region,"" Felter said.
Felter said the United States counted $1.5 billion in foreign military sales to Indonesia since 2013, including Apache (NYSE:APA) helicopters. He said Indonesia had recently taken delivery of the first three of eight Apache helicopters.

The United States was also expected to explore ways to deepen counter-terrorism cooperation with Indonesia, officials said.

976,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",Assange team hopes U.K. could declare him persona non grata,"By Mark Hosenball
London (Reuters) - Julian Assange and his advisers are preparing to try to use Ecuador's decision to grant him diplomatic status to force Britain to declare him persona non grata and expel him, a source close to Assange said.
Reuters also has learned that as part of their continuing criminal investigation of Assange and WikiLeaks, investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation recently sought new information about years-old contacts between WikiLeaks and Chelsea Manning, the former U.S. Army private who leaked the website thousands of classified U.S. government documents.
Ecuador announced earlier this month it granted diplomatic status to Assange, who in 2012 took refuge in its London Embassy after British courts ruled he should be extradited to Sweden for questioning in a sexual molestation investigation.
Swedish authorities have now closed their molestation inquiry. But British authorities have indicated that if he left Ecuador's Embassy, Assange would still be arrested for violating bail conditions, which could put him in a British prison for up to three months.
Assange and his lawyers assert that if he did leave the Embassy, U.S. authorities would then produce criminal charges against him and seek his extradition to the United States, which they believe could result in a lengthy prison term for the WikiLeaks founder.
The source close to Assange said that his legal team were now working on filing a legal case with the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, seeking to have Assange's Ecuadorean diplomatic status affirmed under international law. Britain's Foreign Office had no immediate comment. 
Ecuador's Foreign Ministry said that only the foreign minister, who is traveling in Chile, was authorized to comment on the Assange standoff. 
In a Sunday night television interview, President Lenin Moreno said the foreign ministry was continuing to seek intermediation that would help resolve the situation. ""We hope to have a short term solution to this issue, which has really caused us problems,"" he said. 
Depo Akande, an international law professor at Oxford University, said that Ecuador could argue that Britain had no right under international law to reject its declaration that Assange had diplomatic status. 
""In principle, the U.K. cannot approve or disapprove"" diplomatic status declarations by foreign governments other than for ambassadors or military attaches, Akande said. He said if Britain were ordered by the International Court to accept Ecuador's decision to treat Assange as a diplomat, and were then to declare him persona non grata, it would then ""have to give him facilities to leave"" the country unhindered.
Meanwhile, one of Assange's former close associates from WikiLeaks' early days said German criminal investigators recently contacted him seeking answers to questions they had received from the FBI. 
Daniel Domscheit-Berg, once regarded with Assange as a WikiLeaks co-founder, told Reuters he was contacted in November by investigators from the federal criminal bureau (BKA), Germany's equivalent of the FBI.
He said the BKA told him they had been asked by the FBI to question him regarding Assange's and WikiLeaks' contacts with Chelsea Manning, who while a U.S. Army private then named Bradley Manning and stationed in Iraq purloined hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. military and diplomatic cables and delivered them to WikiLeaks.
Manning, who was granted clemency by former U.S. President Barack Obama, was released in May from a U.S. military prison in Kansas where she had served a seven year prison term for passing secrets to WikiLeaks. Manning, who came out as transgender shortly after her sentencing, recently announced she would seek the Democratic Party's nomination for a U.S. Senate seat in Maryland.

Domscheit-Berg said that representatives of a BKA squad that deals with cyber crime and espionage told him the FBI were seeking fresh information about how actively Assange had been involved in persuading Manning to leak U.S. secrets. He said he informed the BKA he was not interested in helping the FBI.

If found guilty, it would make him Germany's deadliest serial killer.
The man, identified only as Niels H. under reporting rules, has admitted to deliberately injecting patients at two clinics in northern Germany with deadly drugs and then trying to revive them in order to play the hero.
Prosecutors in the northern German city of Oldenburg said an investigation and toxicology reports showed that the accused also gave 35 people at a clinic in Oldenburg and 62 at one in nearby Delmenhorst life-threatening medicines.
Prosecutors said Niels H. should have been aware that the drugs he was giving his patients could cause ailments ranging from possible cardiac arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation to hypotension.
""From the prosecutorial point of view, the accused Niels H. accepted, at least tacitly, in all cases the death of the patients due to the effects of the drugs,"" the prosecutors said in a statement.
The new charges come in addition to two counts of murder for which an Oldenburg court sentenced him to life in prison in 2015.
Ten years ago, a German nurse was convicted of killing 28 elderly patients. He said he gave them lethal injections because he felt sorry for them. He was sentenced to life in prison.

In Britain, Dr. Harold Shipman was believed to have killed as many as 250 people, most of them elderly and middle-aged women who were his patients. Known as Dr. Death, Shipman was sentenced to 15 life terms in 2000; he died prison in 2004, apparently a suicide.

LONDON (Reuters) - The United States needs to pay attention to its treasured relationship with Britain, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Monday just days after Donald Trump canceled a trip to London citing anger at the sale of an embassy.
Trump's cancellation of his trip has raised questions in Britain over the links between Washington and its closest traditional ally in Europe -- widely called the ""special relationship"".
More than a year into his presidency, Trump has yet to visit London and many British voters have promised to protest against a man they see as crude, volatile and opposed to their values on a range of issues.
Tillerson, a former  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) CEO, met British Prime Minister Theresa May in her Downing Street residence and then held talks with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
""We treasure this relationship, and I treasure Boris's relationship with me personally and the work that we do together on these many issues,"" Tillerson told reporters. 
""Sometimes we forget about the importance of our own relationship,"" he said. ""We need to pay attention to that relationship and the importance of this relationship on a bilateral basis as well.""
A pillar of Britain's foreign policy for a century, the special relationship with Washington has taken on added importance as Britain prepares to leave the European Union in 2019. 
May and Tillerson discussed ""continuing depth and breadth"" of the special relationship, May's office said. 
They also touched on one of their most pressing diplomatic challenges: disagreement over the future of a landmark international deal to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. The deal has been cast into doubt by Trump, but Britain, along with France and Germany, wants to keep it. 
TREASURED RELATIONSHIP?
May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his inauguration in January last year, and they were filmed emerging from the White House holding hands. She later said Trump took her hand in a gentlemanly gesture as they walked down a ramp.
But British officials have been dismayed by some of Trump's pronouncements, particularly a proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States and most recently when Trump rebuked May on Twitter after she criticized him for retweeting British far-right anti-Islam videos.
During May's U.S. trip a year ago, she extended an invitation to Trump to make a formal state visit - which includes pomp, pageantry and a banquet with Queen Elizabeth. The invitation was accepted, but no date for the visit has been set.
While in London, Tillerson visited the new $1 billion U.S. embassy. Trump earlier this month criticized the move to new diplomatic premises as part of a bad deal agreed by the administration of Barack Obama.
Trump canceled a trip to London to open the new embassy, saying he did not want to endorse a bad deal agreed by the Obama administration to sell the old one for ""peanuts"".
Tillerson was greeted by U.S. Ambassador Woody Johnson as workers finished planting shrubs in the grounds of the new embassy. America's top diplomat then met some of the marines who are stationed at the embassy. 
""The embassy actually, is gonna really work,"" Johnson said.

Asked when there would be a ribbon cutting ceremony, Ambassador Johnson said: ""At some point we're going to do it, but there's no urgency to that. We'll do it when the time is right.""

Gui, who has Swedish citizenship, was taken away on Saturday by plainclothes police officers as he traveled by train to Beijing, in the company of two Swedish diplomats, The New York Times said. 
Gui was first abducted on holiday in Thailand in 2015, one of five Hong Kong booksellers who went missing that year and later appeared in mainland Chinese custody. 
He was held for publishing books on the personal lives of Communist Party leaders. Chinese authorities said he was released in October last year, although his whereabouts remained unclear.

982,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 10:16AM ET</span>",Catalan crisis rekindled as parliament proposes Puigdemont as leader,"By Rodrigo De Miguel and Teis Jensen
MADRID/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Catalonia's parliament nominated former leader Carles Puigdemont, sacked by Spain for unilaterally declaring independence, as candidate to rule the region again in a sign of defiance to Madrid and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government.
Puigdemont and his supporters say he can rule from self-imposed exile in Belgium, where he fled to in October to avoid arrest for his part in organizing a banned referendum on a split from Spain and the consequent declaration of independence. 
Madrid has rejected this possibility and said it will challenge any attempt by him to rule remotely in the courts.
Puigdemont said on Monday the independence movement would not bow to Spanish authority in comments during a debate held in the University of Copenhagen.
""We will not surrender to authoritarianism,"" Puigdemont said at the event, which marked his first trip away from Belgium in three months.
Puigdemont became the top candidate to lead the wealthy northeastern region again after elections in Catalonia last month gave secessionists a slim majority.
The 55-year old former journalist potentially faces decades of jail in Spain if he is convicted of the charges leveled against him, including rebellion and sedition, for organizing the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Rajoy and his ministers have said they would appeal to the courts and maintain Madrid's direct rule of Catalonia if Puigdemont was elected while abroad.
However, the Catalan parliament's speaker said Puigdemont was the only candidate chosen by parliament to rule the region.
""I am conscious of the warnings that weigh upon him, but I am also conscious of his absolute legitimacy to be candidate,"" Roger Torrent said.
Catalonia's parliament must hold its first vote of confidence on the new leader by Jan. 31. 
Meanwhile, Spain's Supreme Court rejected on Monday a request from the state prosecutor to reactivate a European arrest warrant to detain Puigdemont while he is in Copenhagen.
The court said it was too early to do so while Catalonia's newly-elected parliament was not back to normal yet. 
While at first glance a blow to Madrid's efforts to have Puigdemont arrested, the court's decision could also make it more difficult for the former Catalan leader to be allowed to vote.
Spanish laws make it easier for someone in detention than for someone who is abroad to be granted a parliamentary proxy.
In Copenhagen, Puigdemont declined to comment any further on the day's events.
After weeks of uneasy calm, the political crisis triggered by Catalonia's independence drive flared up again last week when the new regional parliament elected Torrent as speaker at its first sitting.
Despite that tension, Spain's borrowing costs fell to six-week lows on Monday after credit agency Fitch upgraded its sovereign rating to gave Spain its first ""A-"" grade since the euro zone debt crisis. 

According the Danish parliament's diary, Puigdemont has also been invited to a meeting there on Tuesday by Magni Arge, a deputy representing the Faroe Islands, which have their own independence movement seeking secession from Denmark.

983,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 10:14AM ET</span>",Contrite pope apologises for sexual abuse comments that 'wounded many',"By Philip Pullella
ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (Reuters) - Pope Francis, in an extremely rare act of self-criticism, apologised to victims of clerical sex abuse on Sunday, acknowledging he had ""wounded many"" in comments defending a Chilean bishop who is under scrutiny.
But while the pope said he was sorry for his choice of words and tone of voice when he testily answered a reporter's question last Thursday in Chile, he also said he was certain that the prelate, Juan Barros, was innocent.
""I have to apologise,"" an unusually contrite pope told reporters aboard the plane returning to Rome from a week-long trip to Chile and Peru, saying he realised he had ""wounded many people who were abused"".
""I apologise to them if I hurt them without realising it, but it was a wound that I inflicted without meaning to,"" he said. ""It pains me very much.""
In the latest twist to a saga that has gripped Chile, Francis said Barros, who is accused of protecting a notorious paedophile, would remain in his place in the diocese of Osorno because there currently was no credible evidence against him
Last Thursday, a Chilean reporter managed to get close the pope at the end of an event and shouted out a question about Barros.
""The day I see proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk. There is not a single piece of evidence against him. It is all slander. Is that clear?"" the pope replied in a snippy tone.
His comments were seen as trying to dismiss the credibility of accusers and was widely criticised by victims, their advocates and newspaper editorials in Chile and the pope's native Argentina.
On Saturday, even Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston, a key papal adviser, distanced himself with a statement saying the pope had caused ""great pain"".
SLAP IN THE FACE
Francis said on the plane: ""I know how much they (abuse victims) suffer in hearing the pope say to them 'bring me a letter with the proof,' I realise that it is a slap in their faces, and now I realise that my expression was an unfortunate one"".
Barros has been accused of protecting his former mentor, the Rev. Fernando Karadima, who was found guilty in a Vatican investigation in 2011 of abusing teenage boys over many years. Karadima denies the allegations, and Barros said he was unaware of any wrongdoing.
Barros was among the men Karadima trained about 20 years ago. Barros and three others went on to become bishops. A Chilean, Juan Carlos Cruz, said Barros saw Karadima abuse him.
In his comments on the plane, the pope disclosed that Barros had offered to resign twice in recent years but Francis rejected the offers.
""I can't condemn him because I don't have evidence and because I am convinced he is innocent,"" Francis said.
He said Barros would remain in his place unless credible evidence is found against him.
The statement from O'Malley on Saturday implicitly criticising the pope was even more remarkable because O'Malley heads a papal commission advising the pontiff on how to root out sexual abuse in the Church.
CRITICS DECRY DISMAL RECORD
Victims group have criticised the pope's record on abuse.
He defended it on the plane, saying that since he started his papacy in 2013, he had received about 25 requests for pardons by priests convicted of pedophilia, most of them very old. 
""I have not signed even one,"" he said, denying a U.S. media report last year.
While the pope has vowed ""zero tolerance"" for sexual abuse, his efforts have sputtered.
A planned Vatican tribunal to judge bishops accused of covering up sexual abuse or mishandling cases never started and the much-touted commission O'Malley heads has been hit by defections by high-profile non-clerical members who had been victims of abuse when they were children.
Marie Collins of Ireland quit in frustration last year, citing a ""shameful"" lack of cooperation within the Vatican. Another, Peter Saunders of Britain, also quit in frustration.
The pope reminded reporters on the plane that on the first day of his trip to Chile he had expressed his ""pain and shame"" for the rape and molestation of children by priests and later met with two victims.[nL1N1PB0LW]
Juan Carlos Claret, a spokesman for anti-Barros Catholics in Osorno, southern Chile, said during the trip that he worried the pope's response to the reporter before the apology would discourage more victims from speaking out. 

""What incentive will victims have to come forward when even if the courts and the Vatican have said they are right, in the end the pope says they are pure lies?"" he said in an telephone interview.

ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday defended his decision to marry a couple aboard a plane in Chile last week, responding to criticism by conservatives that it flew in the face of Church rules and set a bad precedent.
""Someone told me I was crazy to do something like that,"" he joked during a news conference on the plane taking him back to Rome from Lima, were he ended a trip to Chile and Peru.
In the first such ceremony on a papal flight, Francis married Paula Podest Ruiz, 39, and Carlos Ciuffardi Elorriga, 41, both cabin attendants on Latam airlines.
While the gesture made world headlines and was mostly well-received by Catholics, conservative Catholic commentators and bloggers who regularly criticize the pope on a host of issues blasted the wedding at 36,000 feet.
They said it would make it difficult for pastors to deal with Catholic couples who want to get married in unusual secular locations instead of a church. Those couples would say ""the pope did it, why can't you?"" one commentator wrote.
But the pope said the situation of the Chilean couple was a particular one because they had been already been married in a civil service eight years ago and were not able to marry in their parish church because it collapsed in a 2010 earthquake.
""I questioned them (about marriage) and the responses were clear ... it was clear they had made a commitment for life,"" the pope said, adding that the couple had even remembered subjects from the Catholic pre-marriage courses they had taken long ago. 

""Tell the pastors that they were prepared and I made a judgment call. The sacraments are for people. All the conditions were clear,"" he said.

A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition had no immediate comment on the attack, which residents said occurred early in the morning. The coalition says it does not target civilians in its war against the Iran-aligned Houthi group.
In a separate incident on Monday in southwestern Yemen Houthi fighters killed 12 people when they fired rockets at a parade being held by special security forces, medics said.
Yemen has been torn apart by nearly three years of conflict, with most of the populous north controlled by the armed Houthi group, while the south and east are run by the internationally-recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by a coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia.
Residents of Sohar district, on the outskirts of the provincial capital of Saada, said warplanes had struck the building that housed a small clinic and a house. As well as the seven deaths, five people were injured, residents said.
""A bus that was parked here was thrown behind the house and that house was damaged by the size of the bomb,"" said a man who identified himself as Abu Yasser as people gathered around the destroyed building.
In a separate raid in the same district on Monday two other people - a woman in her seventh month of pregnancy and her husband - were killed when a hanger and flour mill were struck by the coalition, according to the woman's brother-in-law. 
A coalition spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the attack.
The coalition has come under international criticism, including from the United States, following previous attacks. The coalition says its pilots take extra precautions not to hit civilian targets and investigates each report.
In the incident in southwestern Yemen, Houthi fighters fired rockets on Monday at a parade by special security forces in the town of al-Maafer in southwestern Yemen, medics said. The town is near to Taiz, Yemen's third largest city which is controlled by Hadi supporters.
The medics said one rocket hit the main viewing platform, killing 12 people, including two journalists covering the event, but the deputy interior minister in Hadi's government, Nasser Lakhsha, who was attending the parade, escaped unharmed.
The Houthis have made no comment on the attack on Taiz.
The Yemen war has caused a major humanitarian crisis, killing more than 10,000, according to U.N. data issued in 2016. It has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine and led to a cholera epidemic believed to have affected about one million people.

Since the war erupted in 2015, however, little territory has changed hands between the two sides.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The U.S. Embassy in Israel will move to Jerusalem by the end of 2019, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said in a speech to the Israeli parliament on Monday that highlighted a policy shift that has stoked Palestinian anger and international concern.
President Donald Trump last month recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and said he would move the U.S. Embassy there - dismaying Palestinians who claim the eastern part of the city and angering Arab states across the region.
""In the weeks ahead, our administration will advance its plan to open the United States Embassy in Jerusalem – and that United States Embassy will open before the end of next year,"" Pence said.
""Jerusalem is Israel’s capital – and, as such, President Trump has directed the State Department to immediately begin preparations to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem."" 
The speech was briefly disrupted, at the outset, by Israeli Arab parliament members who held up protest signs in Arabic and English, reading ""Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine"", and were ejected by ushers. 
Pence responded to the fracas by saying with a smile: ""It is deeply humbling for me to stand before this vibrant democracy.""
Though shunned by the Palestinians, the Trump administration says it remains committed to helping them and Israel negotiate a peace deal. Those talks have been stalled for almost four years.
""FAIR MEDIATOR""
Responding to Pence's speech, Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said: ""If the United States wanted to a play a role of a mediator in the peace process it must be a fair mediator and it must abide by (international) resolutions.""
Palestinians seek East Jerusalem, including the walled Old City with its holy sites, as the capital of their own future state. Israel, which annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it in 1967 in a move not internationally recognized, regards all of the city as its ""eternal and indivisible capital"".
Pence, who visited Egypt and Jordan before traveling to Israel, said that with its policy shift on Jerusalem, ""the United States has chosen fact over fiction - and fact is the only true foundation for a just and lasting peace"".
It was the highest-ranking visit by a U.S. official to the region since Trump's Jerusalem declaration and gave Pence and Netanyahu an opportunity to highlight their own warm relationship for a conservative Christian American community that serves as a power base for the U.S. administration.
Pence, an evangelical Christian, drew parallels between Jewish history dating back to biblical times and the European pilgrims who founded the United States. He was greeted with ovations by Israeli legislators throughout his speech.
Noting that Israel will in May mark 70 years since its founding - in a war Palestinians mourn as a catastrophe - Pence switched to Hebrew to recite a Jewish prayer of thanksgiving.
Welcoming Pence to the parliament, Netanyahu said he was the first U.S. vice president to have been accorded the honor.
Israel and the United States ""are striving together to achieve a true peace, lasting peace, peace with all our neighbors, including the Palestinians,"" Netanyahu said.
He reiterated his long-standing demand that the Palestinians recognize ""the Jewish people's right to a nation state in its land, a nation state of its own here in the land of Israel"". The Palestinians have ruled out such recognition, saying it would disadvantage Israel's Arab minority.

989,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>","Explainer: Britain's Lords sharpen knives for EU exit laws, but can they block Brexit?","By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Legislation to end Britain's European Union membership begins months of debate in the upper house of parliament this month and is likely to be given a rough ride by largely pro-EU lawmakers.
The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill repeals the 1972 law that made Britain a member, and transfers EU laws into British ones. It was approved by 324 to 295 in the lower House of Commons on Jan. 17 and begins its journey through the House of Lords on Jan. 30. It is expected to take until the summer for it to become law.
Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party does not have a majority in the unelected House of Lords, raising fears among Brexit supporters that the 2016 referendum decision to leave the EU could be thwarted.
But, although May's government is expected to suffer defeats on some parts of the bill, lords are not expected to block Brexit outright, or indeed influence the final shape of the future relationship between Britain and the EU. 
Here's why:
1. What does the House of Lords do?
The House of Lords is a mix of political appointees, members who inherited their positions, and non-political experts on a range of topics. Members are referred to as 'peers'.
Their primary functions are to hold government to account, revise and improve legislation, and consider public policy. 
The Lords is secondary to the directly elected House of Commons in setting policy, and any changes it makes to legislation can be overruled.
As such, it would be extremely unusual for the Lords to agree an outright block on such a major policy as Brexit, particularly one backed by a referendum. The two main parties observe a convention that the Lords should not block policies in the manifesto of the ruling party.
2. Why the fuss? 
Short of blocking Brexit, the Lords can change how Britain enacts its EU exit by adding caveats and restricting the government's powers. It could also inflict politically embarrassing defeats on the government.
May's Conservatives have 248 representatives in the 794-member chamber. The next two biggest parties, Labour and the Liberal Democrats, have 197 and 100. The rest do not follow party voting instructions.
This means the government is outnumbered and must pacify opponents or win over non-political peers, known as crossbenchers, to defeat attempts to change the legislation. 
Given the anti-Brexit leaning of many peers, and concerns in that the legislation gives ministers unconstitutional powers, the government is expected to suffer several defeats on aspects of the bill.
3. What could change?
Objections raised in the Lords will be either political or constitutional. 
Politically, the Liberal Democrats are expected to fight for a second referendum to approve the terms of any exit deal and for Britain to remain in the EU's single market. Without Labour's backing, which it does not currently have, these attempts are likely to fail.
Labour wants to ensure the legislation protects EU-derived workers' rights and incorporates the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights. This position is likely to command enough support to either force the government to make concessions or face defeat.
There is expected to be widespread opposition, even among some Conservative peers, to the government's attempt to fix the date of Brexit in law as March 29, 2019. The move is widely seen as unnecessarily binding and may be cut from the final draft.
Constitutional objections are similarly likely to give the government a headache. Several crossbench legal experts in the Lords have expressed concerns about the way the government proposes to transfer EU law into British law. They say the bill gives ministers powers that are too sweeping.
There is also concern about how the government wants to redistribute legal powers reclaimed from Brussels to devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the crossbenchers will likely join forces on these issues. 
4. What does it mean for Brexit?
Politically, a series of defeats for May's party would embolden critics of her leadership, but as long as the legislation isn't blocked outright the Lords is an unlikely trigger for a move against her. 
Barring a major change of policy from the Labour Party, the legislation enacting Brexit will eventually pass.
But, changes made in the Lords could mean there are additional checks and balances on the transfer of EU laws. 
The government has agreed to extra scrutiny by parliament, but says the timetable is tight.
Changes regarding the protection of human rights and workers' rights will be resisted, but the government may need to make further concessions. 
5. Who should we watch?
MARTIN CALLANAN - May's Brexit man in the Lords. Former MEP and a Brexit campaigner, Callanan will lead the legislation through the house.
ANDREW ADONIS - An outspoken Labour minister-turned-peer who wants to stop Brexit. A fierce critic of the government, Adonis is expected to be the rallying point for peers who want to derail the exit legislation. However, he does not set policy for Labour and is unlikely to be backed by the party.
IGOR JUDGE and DAVID PANNICK - Two crossbenchers with legal backgrounds who will lead on constitutional issues. Both have expressed concern about technical elements of the bill and the powers it creates. They will influence crossbench floating voters.
ANGELA SMITH - Labour's leader in the Lords. Any attempt to defeat the government will likely need Labour endorsement. If Smith and her ministers don't back a proposed change by instructing Labour peers to vote for it, the amendment will likely fail.

PALONG KHALI, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Bangladesh has delayed the repatriation of Rohingya Muslim refugees to Myanmar, set to start on Tuesday, because the process of compiling and verifying the list of people to be sent back is incomplete, a senior Bangladesh official said. 
The decision comes as tensions have risen in camps holding hundreds of thousands of refugees, some of whom are opposing their transfer back to Myanmar because of what they say is a lack of guarantees of their security.
Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed earlier this month to complete the voluntary repatriation of the refugees within two years, starting on Tuesday. Myanmar says it has set up two reception centers and a temporary camp near the border to receive the first arrivals.
But Abul Kalam, Bangladesh's refugee relief and rehabilitation commissioner, said on Monday the return would have to be delayed.
""There are many things remaining,"" he told Reuters by phone. ""The list of people to be sent back is yet to be prepared, their verification and setting up of transit camps is remaining.""
A Bangladesh Border Guard official said it could be months before the transfers begin.
The International Organisation for Migration says the number of Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh since late August now stands at 688,000. The exodus began when the Myanmar military launched a crackdown following insurgent raids on security forces on Aug. 25.
The head of the UNHCR, the United Nations' refugee agency, said more time was needed to prepare the return of the Rohingya refugees to Rakhine, and urged the two governments to involve it in their efforts to resolve the refugee crisis. 
""In order for the repatriation to be right, sustainable, actually viable, you need to really to address a number of issues that for the time being we have heard nothing about, including the citizenship issue, the rights of the Rohingya in Rakhine state, meaning freedom of movement, access to services, to livelihoods,"" Filippo Grandi told Reuters.
The UNHCR, which is helping to administer the refugee camps, is not involved in the repatriation process.
Grandi said it was especially important to set up a monitoring mechanism in northern Rakhine for the returning people. 
The Rohingya have long been denied citizenship by Myanmar, where many in the Buddhist majority regard them as interlopers from Bangladesh.
GUARANTEES
Myanmar said on Monday it was ready to take back the returning Rohingya.
""We are ready to accept them once they come back. On our part, the preparation is ready,"" Ko Ko Naing, director general of Myanmar's Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, told Reuters by phone. 
He declined to comment on whether Bangladesh had informed Myanmar about the delay.
At the Palong Khali refugee camp, near the Naf river that marks the border between the two countries, a group of Rohingya leaders gathered early on Monday morning with a loudspeaker and a banner listing a set of demands for their return to Myanmar. 
These include security guarantees, the granting of citizenship and the group's recognition as one of Myanmar's official ethnic minorities. The Rohingya are also asking that homes, mosques and schools that were burned down or damaged in the military operation be rebuilt.
Bangladesh army troops arrived at the camp and dispersed a crowd of at least 300 people who had gathered to listen to the leaders, according to witnesses who said they saw the army take away one of the Rohingya leaders.
Bangladesh army spokesman Rashedul Hasan said he had not received any information about protests in refugee camps on Monday.
A Bangladesh Border Guard official said there would be no forced repatriation of the refugees to Myanmar and denied they would lose their food ration cards if they remained in the camps.
""This is out of the question. It will be voluntary. But this is not going to be an easy task to send them back as they are reluctant,"" the official in the border district of Cox's Bazaar told Reuters.
Myanmar has said it would build a transit camp that can house 30,000 returnees before they are allowed to return to their ""place of origin"" or somewhere ""nearest to their place of origin"".

The country's state media reported over the weekend that authorities in Rakhine were making final preparations to take back the first batch of refugees.

991,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>",Italy's 5-Star presents election program with no euro referendum,"By Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, leading opinion polls ahead of a March 4 election, has presented a 20-point program which makes no mention of a referendum on Italy's membership of the euro zone.
5-Star has steadily scaled back its commitment to the referendum that used to be one of its main policies. The plan frightened financial markets which saw it as a threat to the whole single currency project.
5-Star's moderate new leader, Luigi Di Maio, who was elected in September, presented the program at a party gathering in Pescara on the Adriatic coast, saying it would be the basis for negotiations with other parties after the election. 
""The political forces will have to tell us why they don't want to converge around this program, and we will ask them on the evening of March 4,"" 31-year-old Di Maio told reporters.
5-Star leads opinion polls with some 28 percent of the vote, about 5 points ahead of the ruling Democratic Party. 
However a center-right alliance of smaller parties, led by Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) totals about 37 percent and is seen winning most parliamentary seats, though not enough for a working majority.
As well as dropping the euro referendum, 5-Star has also shifted away from a previous refusal to consider governing with other parties.
Di Maio says that if the center-right bloc is unable to form a government and 5-Star is the largest party, President Sergio Mattarella must give him a mandate to try to win cross-party support for his program.
5-Star, founded in 2009 by comedian Beppe Grillo, started out as a protest movement that appealed to voters sickened by corruption and cronyism among Italy's political and business elite.
TAX CUTS
Since his election Di Maio has tried to give it a less revolutionary image to win over moderate voters, stressing the party's pro-business agenda as well as the fight against graft.
Top of 5-Star's 20-point plan is a promise to cut red-tape by abolishing 400 ""useless"" laws. It also promises a ""drastic"" reduction in business taxes as well as its flagship policy to fight poverty by offering an income of up to 780 euros per month for all those willing to look for work.
Di Maio also presented some of 5-Star's high-profile candidates at the election, including prominent television journalists and the head of a consumer rights group, countering critics' charge that the party lacks experience and competence.
The candidates also included a coastguard officer, Gregorio De Falco, who became a national hero in 2012 when the Costa Concordia cruise ship capsized, killing 32 people. 
De Falco, who will run for a seat in the Senate, famously told the fleeing captain of the ship to ""Get back on board, damn it!"" during a furious telephone exchange broadcast to millions of Italians on television.
The election program also promises to soften a 2012 pension reform that raised the retirement age. Under 5-Star's plan people will be eligible for a pension after paying 41 years of contributions or if the sum of their age and their years of contributions adds up to 100.
It pledges 50 billion euros of extra public investment in new technologies, offset by 50 billion euros of cuts in ""unproductive"" spending. Overall, the plan is short on detail about how the measures will be funded. 

It promises to increase borrowing to finance investments, but still targets Italy's huge public debt, which currently stands at 132 percent of output, to fall by 40 percentage points over the next decade.

Reuters reported last week the EU would make the move, which introduces a travel ban and an asset freeze on people in charge of security forces accused of widespread abuses, particularly during the 2017 anti-government protests.
While the EU already has an arms embargo in place on Venezuela, it has not considered imposing an oil embargo or blacklisting Maduro himself. 
Oil and related products make up three quarters of Venezuela's exports to the EU. The country has the world's largest proven oil reserves but suffers inflation and food shortages.

The victims from the Rabia family ranged from kindergarten age to the eighth grade, the ministry added on its official Twitter page.
Gulf News, a UAE newspaper, quoted a local police and civil defense officials saying that their mother reported the fire at dawn and though the cause of the blaze remained unknown, a short-circuit was suspected.
A tourism and trade hub, the UAE has suffered several high-profile fires among its trademark high-rise buildings in recent years, few of which caused deaths.
""We have today instructed the state's civil defense to ensure immediately that all necessary fire protection systems are in place in all citizens' homes"", Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Prime Minister and Vice-President of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai, said in a tweet.

After more than 600,000 migrant arrivals by boat in Italy in the past four years, immigration has become a hot-button issue ahead of the March 4 national election. Polls show it to be one of the top concerns among Italians. 
The video was immediately picked up by evening news programs, with a story also appearing in the country's most-read newspaper, Corriere della Sera, on Monday.
Some of those in the video had been involved in scuffles on Friday at the migrant identification center on the small island of Lampedusa, the news reports said. 
On Saturday, the migrants were put on a ferry bound for Porto Empedocle on the Sicilian coast. Upon arrival, asylum seekers were bussed to shelters, while those not seeking asylum were given an expulsion order requiring them to leave the country within seven days, and then sent on their way.
While the procedure is in line with Italian law, it has rarely been documented. Unable and unwilling to return home, most migrants simply ignore the expulsion order and move on toward their destination, often in Northern Europe.
""It's not right that they abandon them to their fate without any help at all,"" Claudio Lombardo, a local activist who shot the video, told Reuters. [nL8N1LP3IP]
""They had to ask me where the train station was.""
In the video, the migrants are seen carrying their expulsion order in one hand as they are handed a packed lunch. Then police watch them as they set off walking down a busy road.
They trudged the 15 km (9 miles) to the nearest train station, where they slept rough and then boarded a train for Palermo, Sicily's capital, in the morning, Lombardo said. From Palermo, they can find transportation further north.
Almost a half million irregular migrants are estimated to be living in Italy, while in 2016, almost a million irregular migrants were found to be living illegally in the European Union. The actual number is likely to be much higher since irregular migrants seek to avoid being identified.
Italian political leaders of all stripes say that irregular migrants should be immediately sent back home, but this is difficult to put into practice. That means often they are ordered to leave the country, but are not physically deported.

""France strongly condemns the violence perpetrated by the security forces during the demonstrations organized on 21 January 2018,"" a foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement. 
""It reiterates its call for respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, starting with the right to protest.""
Kabila's refusal to step down at the end of his mandate in December 2016 has triggered a series of street protests in which scores have been killed in Kinshasa. It has also emboldened armed rebel groups in different parts of the country.
In the statement, France called for the proportionate use of force in the maintenance of law and order.
The instability has stoked fears that the vast, mineral-rich Democratic Republic of Congo could slide back into the wars that killed millions in the 1990s, mostly from hunger and disease.

The EU limits public sector deficits to 3 percent of GDP. Italy's budget deficit came in at 2.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 and was below that level last year, according to Italy's central bank.
""The 3 percent deficit rule can be a debatable one, but we intend on respecting it,"" Berlusconi told reporters after a meeting at the headquarters of the center-right European People's Party in Brussels.
Berlusconi added that he believed that his taxation plans would lift economic growth in Italy and also reduce the country's high level of sovereign debt.
""Today at 134 percent (of GDP), we want absolutely to reduce this percentage and want to bring it at least to 125 percent,"" he said.

Opinion polls show the center-right grouping involving Berlusconi is in the lead ahead of an election on March 4.

The comments from Chief of the General Staff Nick Carter, due to be delivered in a speech on Monday, reflect concerns among the top brass and some politicians that defense spending is being too tightly squeezed because of wider fiscal austerity.
""Our ability to pre-empt or respond to threats will be eroded if we don't keep up with our adversaries,"" General Carter will say, according to excerpts of his speech circulated by the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, where he is due to deliver it.
""The time to address these threats is now – we cannot afford to sit back.""
Carter will point to Russia, saying it has demonstrated its long-range strike capability on numerous occasions, for example when it fired 26 cruise missiles with a range of 1,500 km into Syria in October 2015.
He will also cite massive war games conducted last year by the Russian military in Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave between Lithuania and Poland, which have rattled some governments that see them as Moscow testing its ability to wage war against the West. [nL5N1LZ49Q]
Britain is among NATO members who have reinforced their presence in the Baltic region in response to Russia's show of strength.
Carter will also warn that in addition to traditional threats posed by foreign armies, Britain had to keep up with increasingly creative forms of disruption from adversaries.
""State-based competition is now being employed in more novel and increasingly integrated ways and we must be ready to deal with them,"" he is expected to say.
""The threats we face are not thousands of miles away but are now on Europe’s doorstep - we have seen how cyber warfare can be both waged on the battlefield and to disrupt normal people’s lives - we in the UK are not immune from that.""
Carter's speech, which was approved by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, will be widely seen as a pitch for increased defense spending at a time when cabinet ministers are making competing arguments for where limited resources are most needed.
Britain spends about 2 percent of its Gross Domestic Product on defense, in line with its commitments as a NATO member.
Under the government's last spending plans, issued in late 2015, defense spending was expected to rise slightly above inflation over a five-year period.
However, some politicians have expressed concerns that the spending levels were not sufficient to meet new threats, and that some of the Ministry of Defence's procurement plans were based on over-optimistic assumptions.
In particular, parliament's defense committee said in a report in December that some plans to acquire military equipment relied on money being freed up by efficiency savings which the lawmakers were concerned may not materialize.

The firebrand leader sought to dispel speculation he had ordered loyalists in Congress to change the constitution to introduce a federal system that would let him stay in power beyond 2022, when his single term ends.
""If I overstay and wanted to become a dictator, shoot me, I am not joking,"" Duterte told soldiers during an army base visit, adding that security forces should not allow anybody to mess with the constitution.
""It is your job to protect the constitution and to protect the people. Remember, it is your solemn duty.""
Duterte has advocated federalism to tackle inequality, empower provinces and recognize the country's diverse makeup.
Last week, his lower house allies voted to convene a constituent assembly to revise the charter by May this year, scrapping mid-term elections next year and extending the terms of all elected officials. 
Constitutional reform has been a divisive issue, with critics accusing lawmakers of trying to prolong their stay in office, or of seeking a way for the hugely popular Duterte to cling to power beyond the end of his term.
Opponents warn it could lead to a repeat of the oppressive rule of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, saying they are troubled by Duterte's admiration for Marcos and his similar authoritarian traits.

Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque, has repeatedly said the president has no desire to stay longer than his term and, if anything, would prefer to retire earlier.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan security officials met on Monday to draw up a response to a deadly attack on Kabul's Hotel Intercontinental that exposed once again how vulnerable the capital remains to militant assaults.
Even in a city long inured to violence, the attack by gunmen dressed in army uniforms has caused shock, with questions raised about how they were able to penetrate security at one of the most prominent landmarks in Kabul.
The smoke-blackened hotel, on a hill overlooking the city, remained blocked off on Monday and even the final casualty toll from the attack, which began on Saturday night and was claimed by Taliban insurgents, remains unclear.
Officially, the government says at least 19 people were killed but people in the security system say the real figure is certainly above 30 and probably many more. The Taliban are seeking to re-impose Islamic rule after their 2001 ouster at the hands of U.S.-led troops.
Many of the victims were Ukrainian air crew of Kam Air and their deaths may raise questions over the willingness of foreign technical specialists to continue to work for Afghan companies who cannot provide the high levels of security provided by the United Nations or foreign embassies.
Airlines provide a vital link between major cities in a country where travel by road is often dangerous and unreliable. 
""Many Ukrainian air technicians work in Afghanistan and all those killed worked for the Afghan airline Kam Air and lived in the Intercontinental Hotel,"" Ukraine's Ambassador to Afghanistan, Viktor Nikityuk, who is based in neighboring Tajikistan, told Ukrainian television.
He confirmed that seven Ukrainians had been killed and said a consular official would be visiting Kabul to organize repatriation of their bodies.
Many details of what happened in the attack, which began at around 9 p.m. on Saturday, remain unclear and interest is likely to focus on the private security company which took over protection duties three weeks ago.
According to a security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the five gunmen got through an initial checkpoint on the approach road to the hotel before reaching a second checkpoint close to a car park near the hotel entrance.
At that point, the official said they appeared to have shot the checkpoint guards and made their way around the back of the building and into the kitchen before beginning the attack.
Once inside, they went through the ground and first floors, opening fire on staff and guests before moving quickly to the upper levels of the six-floor building.
Hassibullah, who was working in the hotel bakery, said he ran upstairs to a fifth-floor room and barricaded himself in with around 12 people, including guests, when the firing started. He survived a jump to the ground, suffering two broken legs, a broken back and internal injuries.
Speaking from a hospital bed, he said the attackers began firing into the door, which the guests had blocked with piled-up furniture when the lights went out and he took his only chance.

""The only thing I could do was open the window and jump out,"" he said.

In total, 18,088 asylum requests were registered last year, down 9,119 from 2016 and less than half the 39,523 requests of 2015, Switzerland said. 
Not since 2010, when 15,567 applied for asylum in Switzerland, have numbers been below 20,000. 
Neighboring Germany, where more than a million migrants arrived since 2015, also saw a slowdown in 2017 of about a third to 186,000, though some government officials contend the figure remains too high. 
In addition to a slowdown of asylum bids from the conflict-torn Middle East, Swiss officials said the flow of applications from Africans seeking to win refugee status in Europe also lost momentum. 
""On the one hand, migration of persons from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq that characterized asylum applications in 2016 was a phenomenon that largely disappeared in 2017,"" the State Secretariat for Migration said in a statement. 
""Secondly, the decline in migration across the central Mediterranean Sea from mid-July 2017 has led to a sharp decline in asylum applications from sub-Saharan African countries,"" it added.
People from Eritrea topped the Swiss list of asylum seekers, making up nearly a fifth of requests, followed by Syrians, Afghans and people from Turkey who sought asylum amid a widening crackdown following that country's failed 2016 coup.
Even as the flow of Middle Eastern and African asylum seekers slips, some European countries have seen a rise.
In France, for instance, official requests rose 17 percent to exceed 100,000, the highest ""in at least four decades"", as an influx of Albanians seeking economic opportunity outside of their home country helped drive the rise, even though they had little chance of successfully winning asylum.

Speaking on arrival at a European foreign ministers meeting in Brussels, Jean-Yves Le Drian also said the 28 ministers would reiterate their concerns over Iran's activities in Yemen, Lebanon and Syria, which he described as destabilizing.
""We will also have the opportunity of underlining our firmness on Iran's compliance with United Nations Resolution 2231, which limits access to ballistic capacity and which Iran does not respect,"" Le Drian said.
Under the U.N. resolution enshrining the 2015 nuclear deal with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, Iran is ""called upon"" to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to 8 years.
Some states say this phrasing does not make it an obligatory commitment.
Iran has repeatedly said its missile program is purely defensive and denied they are designed to carry nuclear warheads.
Le Drian on Sunday said he would travel to Iran in March and that France had begun talks with Tehran to discuss its missile program and regional activities.
But Iran's foreign ministry spokesman on Monday dismissed the suggestion of talks on either issue.
""If there is such a quote (from the French foreign minister) that we held talks, we deny it. We have not had any negotiations about our missile and defense capabilities and will not talk about these issues with others,"" Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency on Monday.
With U.S. President Donald Trump warning of a last chance for ""the worst deal ever negotiated"", Britain, France and Germany have begun talks on a plan to satisfy him by addressing Iran's ballistic missile tests and its regional influence while preserving the 2015 accord.
""The French foreign minister is not familiar with Iranian society yet,"" Qasemi said. ""Iran has proved that it would not change course under pressure. 

""We should surely discuss Iran's influence in the region because it has been a positive one and everyone has benefited from it. Without Iran's influence, terrorists (would have) captured Damascus and Baghdad,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited the new $1 billion U.S. embassy in London on Monday, just days after his boss Donald Trump criticized the move to new diplomatic premises as part of a bad deal agreed by the administration of Barack Obama.
Trump earlier this month canceled a trip to London to open the new embassy, saying he did not want to endorse a bad deal agreed by the Obama administration to sell the old one for ""peanuts"".
Tillerson was greeted by U.S. Ambassador Woody Johnson as workmen finished planting shrubs in the grounds of the new embassy. America's top diplomat then met some of the marines who are stationed at the embassy.
""The embassy actually, is gonna really work,"" U.S. Ambassador Johnson said ahead of Tillerson's arrival.
Asked when there would be a ribbon cutting ceremony, Ambassador Johnson said: ""At some point we're going to do it, but there's no urgency to that. We'll do it when the time is right.""
The decision to move the U.S. Embassy from its current Grosvenor Square (NYSE:SQ) location in the exclusive Mayfair area of London and to a site on the south bank of the Thames was agreed in 2008 under the presidency of George W. Bush. 
The American flag was this month removed from Grosvenor Square where the U.S. embassy has been based since 1938 with the area known as ""Little America"" during World War Two, when the square also housed the military headquarters of General Dwight D. Eisenhower.
The new embassy is a veritable fortress set back at least 100 feet (30 meters) from surrounding buildings - mostly newly-erected high-rise residential blocks - and incorporating living quarters for U.S. Marines permanently stationed inside.

The $1 billion construction was funded by the sale of other properties in London.

Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong, a Vietnamese, are charged with murdering Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a chemical poison banned by the United Nations, at Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13 last year.
The women have pleaded not guilty, saying they thought they were involved in some sort of prank for a reality TV show. Four North Koreans who were also charged in the killing have fled the country, prosecutors say.
The two women face the death penalty if convicted. 
A total of 29 witnesses have testified for the prosecution in the trial, which resumed Monday after a two-month interval.        
Another four witnesses are expected to testify this week, before police lead investigator Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz, the prosecution's star witness, retakes the stand, prosecutor Muhammad Iskandar Ahmad told the court on Monday.     
""We hope to complete questioning of all witnesses by March,"" he told reporters outside the court, adding that hearings have been scheduled until May.  
The court suspended Wan Azirul's testimony last year, following requests from defence lawyers to examine new evidence introduced midway through the trial.    
Prosecutors have screened video recordings in court showing the women meeting the four fugitives at the airport prior to the attack on Kim Jong Nam. The video also shows one of the women appearing to smear something on Kim's face. 
Expert witnesses also testified that traces of VX were found on the clothing of both women, while Kim Jong Nam suffered seizures and showed symptoms of nerve agent poisoning before his death.
Defence lawyers have argued the killing was politically motivated, with many key suspects linked to the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, suggesting the two women were merely unwitting pawns in the attack.
Gooi Soon Seng, Siti Aisyah's lawyer, accused prosecutors of taking ""a simplistic approach"" to the case by failing to address the women's motives.
""The prosecution's whole case is based only on the CCTV recordings and the VX found on the two women - basically showing that their actions led to the victim's death.
""But we still don't know what motive these women had (for killing him),"" he told reporters during a break in Monday's hearing.   
Airport videos showed three of the fugitives were driven to the murder site in a car bought by a North Korean embassy official.
The embassy's second secretary and an official from Air Koryo, North Korea's state airline, were also seen at the airport helping the men flee.
North Korea has denied accusations by South Korean and U.S. officials that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime was behind the killing. 

The trial resumes on Tuesday.

The Muslim-majority Southeast Asian nation has been on high alert since gunmen linked to Islamic State (IS) launched several attacks in Jakarta, the capital of neighboring Indonesia, in January 2016.
The two suspects were arrested in two separate raids in December and January, on suspicion of planning to carry out acts of violence and promoting IS ideology.
One of them, an Indonesian who was arrested last week, had allegedly scoured a busy district of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, in November, seeking Buddhist monks to kill, in retaliation for violence suffered by Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.
""The attempt failed, and police managed to confiscate a knife during the raid,"" Mohamad Fuzi Harun, the inspector-general of police, said in a statement.
He added that the suspect had also allegedly communicated with a senior IS leader over WhatsApp, had sought to recruit several other Indonesians and put up an IS flag at the building site where he worked.
The other suspect, a Malaysian teacher at a private religious school, was detained in December on suspicion of planning an attack on entertainment outlets and to rob, kidnap or kill non-Muslims.
The suspect, who had been previously jailed under Malaysia's anti-terror law, had also maintained contact with former members of known terror groups and promoted IS ideology on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account to recruit new members, police said.
Malaysia has arrested hundreds of people over the past few years for suspected links to militant groups.
A grenade attack on a bar on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur in June 2016 wounded eight people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, the first such incident on Malaysian soil.

The Syrian army and government have consistently denied using chlorine or other chemical weapons during Syria's conflict, now in its seventh year.
The White Helmets civil defense rescue force, which operates in rebel-held parts of Syria, said 13 civilians including women and children had been ""injured after (the) Assad regime used Chlorine gas in Douma city in EasternGhouta"". 
Douma is in the eastern Ghouta, a suburb east of Damascus where almost 400,000 people have been under siege by the Syrian government and allied militia since 2013. Eastern Ghouta is the last major rebel position close to the capital.
The health directorate for opposition-held areas in the Damascus region said patient symptoms ""suggest they have been exposed to chlorine gas inhalation"". 
It said patients said the smell around the attack site resembled chlorine. 
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, quoting local medical and other sources, said ""gasses"" released during a dawn rocket attack on Douma city caused ""cases of suffocation"". 
The Observatory said a gas was also used during a rocket attack last week on the enclave. 
A witness in the area said people had fled the area of the attack and were receiving treatment for breathing problems at medical centers.
In the past two years, a joint U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inquiry has found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin and has also several times used chlorine as a weapon. 

It has also said Islamic State has used sulfur mustard.

The film ""Padmaavat"" ran into trouble after groups critical of the project accused its director, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, of distorting history by portraying a Muslim ruler as the ""lover"" of Queen Padmavati of the Hindu Rajput warrior clan.
Monday's action comes after the Supreme Court last week cleared the way for the film's release and blocked state governments from imposing bans on it, saying it had been cleared for release by India's censor panel. [nL3N1PD3YG]
The central state of Madhya Pradesh and the northwestern state of Rajasthan, both ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), asked the court to modify its order for nationwide release of the film. 
""We will hear the pleas tomorrow,"" Chief Justice Dipak Misra, who is heading a panel of three supreme court judges that will hear the case, said on Monday.
In its request to the court, the government of Rajasthan cited the need to prevent public unrest, in view of sentiment among the Rajput community.
The states' move comes against a backdrop of continued protests by right-wing groups, such as the Shri Rajput Karni Sena, which blocked traffic in parts of northern India on Sunday and shouted slogans demanding for a complete ban on the film.
Members of a Rajput community group called the Sarwa Kshatriya Mahasabha in the central state of Chhattisgarh have also threatened to disrupt screenings in theatres there.
The group plans to hold a protest meeting on Monday in Raipur, the state capital, to warn cinema owners, and will organize a human chain on Wednesday to demand a complete ban.

""We have already told the cinema-halls not to screen the film,"" Rakesh Singh Bais, the group's president, told Reuters. ""If any one does, he will be responsible for the consequences.""

The strike, starting with pre-dawn pickets, marked an escalation in protests after unions this weekend rejected a government proposal to employ 100 extra guards this year and a further 1,000 before the 2022 end of Macron's mandate. 
Guards burned tyres and wooden pallets outside the gates to several jails ahead of talks hastily convened by Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet.
""We will not be used as cannon fodder. We won't give an inch,"" Yoan Karar, a senior Force Ouvriere (FO) union official, told CNews.
His union is demanding higher wages and rapid hiring of 2,400 staff.
Macron's pressure is under mounting pressure to resolve the unrest among prison staff after several attacks on guards by inmates in different jails in the past week. 
On Friday, riot police clashed with guards manning a picket outside the Fleury Merogis prison, where protests first erupted after an Islamist militant jailed over the killing of 21 people in Tunisia in 2000 slashed guards on the head and torso with a pair of scissors in northern France.
Over the weekend, the government also proposed separating France's most violent inmates from the rest of the 70,000 prison population, one of Europe's largest.
President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this month that a plan would be presented in February that it would go beyond an existing pledge to build thousands of new prison cells.
France's prison population has more than doubled since the 1970s, and prison guards complain increasingly that they have neither the staff nor the equipment and support to deal with violent inmates, notably convicted Islamists and petty criminals who become radicalized while in prison. 
Union representative Karar, a guard for 13 years at Fresnes prison on the edge of Paris, said records put the number of attacks on security staff at 4,000 a year.

""You cannot put a guard in charge of 100 or 150 prisoners and just give him a whistle,"" said Karar, calling for guards to be armed with taser guns.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Czech presidential challenger Drahos ahead of incumbent Zeman in poll,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Independent challenger Jiri Drahos holds a narrow lead over Milos Zeman, the incumbent president of the Czech Republic, before this weekend's election, but undecided voters could tilt the balance, an opinion poll showed on Monday.
Drahos, a soft-spoken academic, is hoping to unite liberal, pro-western Czech voters alienated by Zeman's blunt and occasionally vulgar style and preference for Russia and China. 
The incumbent's anti-immigration, anti-elitist message retains strong appeal. His long experience in politics as former leader of the center-left Social Democrats and prime minister in 1998-2002 are also advantages.
A poll of 1,078 people by STEM/MARK for the newspaper Mlada fronta Dnes showed 47 percent of voters backed Drahos while 43 percent supported Zeman. The remaining 10 percent of undecided respondents who want to vote will be the decisive force.
A previous poll by Kantar TNS released on Sunday, Zeman edged Drahos by 45.5 to 45 percent, although Drahos had more convinced voters.
The Jan. 26-27 second round echoes the divisions in presidential elections in neighbors Austria and Slovakia, as well as U.S. President Donald Trump's battle with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the White House in 2016.
The 73-year-old Zeman has courted the far right and the Communist Party in rejecting migrants from Muslim countries while pursuing warmer relations with Russia and China and sniping at the press. He won the first election round with 38.6 percent of the vote.
Drahos, 68, finished second on 26.6 percent with support from liberal voters attracted by his policies favoring European Union integration. 
The vote is seen as a referendum on Zeman, who has been in office since 2013. Most candidates who lost in the first round of voting have endorsed Drahos.
Czech presidents have limited executive power, but they do appoint prime ministers and central bankers, represent the country abroad and can have a big influence in public opinion.
This election might also affect the leadership of the next government. Prime Minister Andrej Babis is rushing to form a new cabinet before a new presidential term starts on March 8.
The billionaire businessman Babis, whose ANO party was a runaway winner in a parliamentary election last October, has struggled to get governing partners while he battles police allegations of EU subsidy fraud, which he denies.

Zeman has backed Babis, who in turn has endorsed Zeman in the election. Drahos has advised Babis to step aside to help a new administration form and has said it would be unacceptable to have a prime minister who faces police charges.

The vessels approached the area of the drills early on Monday to monitor Iranian ships, said Rear Admiral Mahmoud Mousavi, spokesman for the drills, according to Tasnim news agency.
""Iranian drones identified the vessels, then Iranian planes flew over them and gave them a warning. The vessels left the area,"" he was quoted as saying.
The Iranian army launched two days of exercises on Monday involving ground, naval and air forces in the country's south and southeast, near the Makran Coast, and other areas in the Gulf of Oman.
There have been periodic confrontations between the Iranian and U.S. military in the Gulf - a major trade route for oil - in recent years.
In the first such incident since President Donald Trump took office, a U.S. Navy ship fired warning shots when an Iranian vessel approached to within 450 feet (140 meters) last July.
The following month an unarmed Iranian drone came within 100 feet (30 meters) of a U.S. Navy warplane as it prepared to land on an aircraft carrier in the Gulf.
During the presidential campaign last September, Trump said any Iranian vessel that harassed the U.S. Navy in the Gulf would be ""shot out of the water"".

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's high court on Monday remanded in jail a young protest leader calling for independence from China after he pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer in the latest case highlighting a new generation of opposition to Chinese rule.
About 130 people, mostly police officers, were hurt in a 2016 Lunar New Year protest when masked activists threw bricks and burned trash cans to vent anger at what they saw as China's encroachment of Hong Kong's culture and autonomy.
On Monday, the former head of radical group Hong Kong Indigenous, Edward Leung, 26, pleaded not guilty to one charge of inciting a riot and two charges of rioting.
Judge Anthea Pang decided to revoke bail for Leung and another defendant, Wong Ka-kui, who pleaded guilty to rioting at the trial, whose proceedings started last Thursday, and for which the court has allotted 80 days.
Rioting carries a maximum jail term of 10 years. 
Four other defendants also pleaded not guilty to rioting and other charges. 
During the clashes, later labeled a riot by the government, a policeman fired two warning shots in the air, a rare event in Hong Kong. The action aimed ""to put the scene under control,"" the prosecution said in a court document on Monday.
The former British colony has been governed under a ""One Country, Two Systems"" arrangement after it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
But democracy activists say Beijing is increasingly interfering with the city's autonomy, while pro-government figures urge more respect for Beijing's authority.
When a months-long ""Occupy"" street occupation failed to wrestle more democratic rights from Beijing's Communist Party rulers in 2014, a generation of young activists began pushing for outright independence, a red line for China. 
Chinese and Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly condemned the movement, citing the city's mini-constitution, the ""Basic Law"", which says it is ""an inalienable part"" of China.
The nascent movement peaked in early 2016, when Leung, then a philosophy student at the University of Hong Kong, lost his bid for a seat in the city's legislature by-election but secured a surprising 15 percent of votes. 
But it lost steam after Leung was barred from running again, his two allies who won legislature seats were disqualified over the manner in which they took their oaths, and several protesters were jailed for rioting.

New York-based Human Rights Watch on Thursday said President Rodrigo Duterte had not only resisted calls to end his brutal campaign, but handled criticism by ""impugning, harassing, and threatening critics of the government and human rights defenders"".
The president's office held a news conference on Monday with police and the drugs enforcement agency to present a detailed rebuttal to a report the foreign minister, Alan Peter Cayetano, said was without ""any real research, study or investigation"".
Cayetano at the weekend challenged HRW to prove 12,000 people had died in the drugs war, while police spokesman Dionardo Carlos asked the group to provide evidence to help with investigations.
""We hope that they will be more specific, engage us so we can help look into the cases,"" he said.
Carlos said 3,987 people had been killed in anti-drug operations during the 18-month crackdown, while some 11 percent, or 2,235, of the total 19,560 murders under police investigation were drug-related.
Eighty-five security forces had been killed during the campaign, he said.
In response to international criticism over what activists and the political opposition say are summary executions and cover-ups, Duterte suspended police from the campaign in October, but has since decided to bring them back.
The authorities deny systematic abuses are taking place in the campaign and say those killed had violently resisted arrest. Activists dismiss that as implausible.
""Oplan Tokhang"", where police visit homes of users and dealers and seek their surrender, is to resume soon, Carlos said, adding that it had brought positive results. 
He said more than 1.3 million drugs users had turned themselves in seeking rehabilitation and police had made 119,361 arrests.
The authorities have seized more than two and a half tonnes of the methamphetamine ""shabu"", with a street value of 13.2 billion pesos ($259.4 million)

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) on Monday demanded concessions on immigration and healthcare from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives in looming coalition talks that the center-left party voted for at the weekend.
At an SPD congress where divisions over the proposed alliance were laid bare, 56 percent of delegates voted on Sunday to start formal negotiations on the basis of a blueprint agreed earlier this month.
That was a narrower margin than many analysts had predicted and put pressure on SPD leaders to refine the initial agreement to appease reluctant members.
Merkel, SPD leader Martin Schulz and the leader of Merkel's CSU Bavarian allies, Horst Seehofer, will meet on Monday and the full talks may start as early as Tuesday.
""I think the conservatives have understood that the SPD must be convinced,"" SPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil told public broadcaster ARD.
He said the SPD wanted to add a ""hardship provision"" to an agreement on immigration that limits to 1,000 a month the number of people who can join accepted refugees in Germany under family reunion rules. 
He also hoped for a compromise on the single ""citizen's insurance"" that the SPD wants to replace Germany's private and public healthcare systems with, a measure opposed by the conservatives.
Some fear that if SPD leaders fail to deliver on such key issues, the party's rank-and-file might reject a final deal - on which Schulz plans to ballot all 443,000 of its members. 
Eyeing a fourth term as chancellor, Merkel wants the SPD to agree to a re-run of the 'grand coalition' that has governed Europe's economic powerhouse since 2013.
She said she looked forward to intensive talks on forming a stable government and her priorities were preserving Germany's economic strength and ensuring social justice and security. 
The SPD vote will be welcomed by investors and Germany's partners who worry that policymaking, both at home and in Europe, may become hamstrung by a political deadlock that is about to enter its fifth month. 
NO CONCESSIONS?
Schulz, whose leadership was on the line on Sunday, said the vote handed him a ""duty to fight for all those who had voted against"". ""Let us now concretely improve the lives of people in the country,"" he tweeted on Sunday evening. 
The SPD's parliamentary leader Andrea Nahles said she would negotiate ""until the other side squeals"".
But Volker Bouffier, a lawmaker of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), said any major changes to the coalition blueprint in the formal talks should be ruled out.
""Coalition negotiations between the CDU/CSU and the SPD need to start quickly,"" he told daily Bild. ""The result of the exploratory talks stands. The key issues can no longer be called into question.""
Merkel has made clear that the blueprint will form the basis of negotiations but that many questions have yet to be clarified in detail.
Both parties suffered heavy losses to the far-right in national elections in September and Merkel was weakened further by the collapse in November of three-way coalition talks with other parties, raising questions about her future.

In the blueprint, there is a clause that envisages a review of the next government's progress after two years to assess if changes are needed, sparking speculation that it might also be engineering an opportunity for Merkel to step down.

Under Nigel Farage, UKIP became one of the most significant political forces in recent British politics by convincing former Prime Minister David Cameron to call a vote on EU membership and then campaigning successfully for Britain to leave.
But since Farage left after Brexiteers won the referendum, UKIP has descended into chaos, partly as its main aim - leaving the EU - is now the official policy of both the Conservative and Labour parties.
UKIP leader Henry Bolton has refused to resign since his 25-year-old lover, Jo Marney, made offensive comments about Markle and black people in text messages to a friend.
Marney who began dating Bolton just after Christmas, described U.S. actress Markle, whose father is white and mother is African-American, as a ""dumb little commoner"" and said “her seed with (sic) taint our royal family"", according to the texts printed in a Sunday newspaper.
Marney also described black people as ugly. She later apologized for the text messages and Bolton said they were ending their romantic relationship.
Bolton lost a vote of confidence from the party's national executive committee but has insisted that he would not quit.
UKIP's deputy leader, Margot Parker, resigned in protest at Bolton's refusal to go, the BBC reported.
Led by the Farage, UKIP won nearly four million votes in 2015, 12.6 percent of those cast, on its anti-EU platform, projecting it to the forefront of British politics even though it only managed to win one seat in parliament.
Its popularity prompted Cameron, who once dismissed the party as being full of ""fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists"", to hold the referendum and played a major role in securing a vote to leave the EU.
But since then it has been riven by internal strife and it won just 1.8 percent of the total votes cast in a national election last June.

Mayon, the country's most active volcano, has been spewing ash, lava, and pyroclastic material since Jan. 13, displacing close to 40,000 residents in the central province of Albay.
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) raised its alert on Mayon to level 4, signifying a hazardous eruption is imminent, from level 3, which warns that such an eruption could be ""weeks or even days"" away.
""We strongly advise all people, both residents and tourists, to avoid the danger zone, and airlines to avoid flying near the volcano summit,"" agency chief Renato Solidum told a news conference. 
The danger zone around the 2,462-metre (8,077-foot) volcano has been expanded to a radius of 8 km (5 miles), he added.
Solidum said the agency had recorded increased seismic activity and ""lava fountaining and a summit explosion"" from Sunday night, indicating more explosions ahead, including a hazardous eruption.
A level 5 alert signifies a hazardous eruption is underway.
Albay province has run out of emergency funds and more people would be evacuated once government financial help arrived, said provincial governor Al Francis Bichara.
He ordered schools to suspend classes, amid ash fall warnings following the explosion at the volcano.
""In some areas...it's already zero visibility, especially along the foot of the volcano,"" he told CNN Philippines, adding that strong winds could carry ash to distant towns. 
""(People) have to stay home and if they intend to get out of their houses, they have to wear masks,"" Bichara said.

HANOI (Reuters) - A court in Vietnam on Monday sentenced a former politburo official to 13 years in prison and another high-profile energy official to life imprisonment for embezzlement and violating state rules, in a corruption crackdown, state media said.
Dinh La Thang, a former politburo official and the most senior Vietnamese politician tried in decades, was jailed for 13 years for ""deliberate violation of state regulations on economic management that caused serious consequences,"" state-run Voice of Vietnam and the Vietnam News Agency said.
Trinh Xuan Thanh, a high-profile official whom Germany said Vietnamese agents kidnapped in a Berlin park in a scene reminiscent of Cold War disappearances, was sentenced to life in prison for both violating state regulations and embezzlement.
Their sentencing concluded the trial of 22 people connected to violations at state oil and gas group PetroVietnam's (PVN) thermal power project that caused losses of 119 billion dong ($5 million) for PVN.
More trials are expected this year as part of a Communist party-led crackdown the government says is targeting fraud and mismanagement. Both Thang and Thanh were prosecuted for other corruption cases, separate from Monday's case.
Critics say the crackdown is also politically motivated, however, and is targeting those close to former premier Nguyen Tan Dung after the influence of Vietnam's conservative security forces grew in 2016 following a power struggle in the party.
PRISON TRUCKS
Policemen escorted Thang and Thanh separately to the courtroom in prison trucks. They wore simple shirts and jackets as judges in dark gowns read their sentences in images broadcast by state media.
The courtroom was packed with judges, defendants, police as well as lawyers and other officials. Only a few state-run media were allowed in, while other reporters watched the televised trial from a separate room. 
Foreign media were not permitted to attend the trial or allowed in the televised room but some foreign embassy staff were reportedly given access.
Thanh was a former chairman of PVN's unit PetroVietnam Construction before becoming a vice chairman for the Hau Giang province, where he was found to have a luxury Lexus car with a government license plate, causing an outcry in a country where officials are supposed to live modestly.
Authorities have mostly focused on the banking and energy sectors but the campaign has spread to other industries, including real estate, and provincial offices of the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam.
PVN is a tangled enterprise of 15 direct units, 18 subsidiaries and 46 affiliates in which it owns smaller stakes with hundreds of millions of dollars in losses racked up at units such as banks, power plants and textile mills.
The PetroVietnam scandal is connected to the banking sector through a deal in which the oil firm lost $35 million in an investment in Ocean Bank. 
The lender's former chief executive, a previous PetroVietnam chairman, was sentenced to death.
Thanh and Thang both apologized to the Communist Party in statements to the Hanoi court last week.

EDINBURGH (Reuters) - The British government believes the question of whether it alone can stop Brexit is irrelevant, since it does not intend to change its mind about leaving the European Union, according to its response to a legal challenge by Scottish lawmakers opposed to Brexit.
In a court document seen by Reuters, Theresa May's government submitted its legal response to the challenge filed by a group of anti-Brexit Scottish lawmakers at Scotland's Court of Session, its supreme civil court. Now the court must decide within a two-week period whether a full hearing should be called.
The petitioners seek to show that Britain can, if the case arises, change its mind about leaving the world's biggest trading bloc and do so alone. They say if that were the case, Britain's bargaining position would be strengthened because it would not have to kowtow to the demands of the other 27 EU members to rejoin.
May formally notified the EU of Britain's intention to leave by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on March 29 last year, starting a two-year exit process.
She has said she will not tolerate any attempt in parliament to block it. But British lawmakers defied the government in December by voting against May's wishes and securing parliament a much more substantial say on whether to accept the final Brexit deal.
The 21-page court document, sent as a response from Britain's Brexit Minister David Davis, argued that the petitioners had failed to provide proper grounds. ""There not being a genuine dispute as to the proper construction of Article 50(2) TEU, the orders sought should be refused.""
A spokeswoman for the UK government had no immediate comment.
Britons voted 51.9 percent to leave the EU in June 2016, and May is currently drawing up a plan for Britain's prospective trade deal with the EU after Brexit happens.
""What would be terrible would be for parliament to decide it doesn't like the (Brexit) deal the government has managed to do and it fell a long way short of what the people were promised in the referendum campaign and for no one to know what that meant,"" Jo Maugham QC, who has crowd-funded the petition, told Reuters.
""It would be enormously disruptive to the political and economic life of the whole of the European Union,"" he said.
""What we can't know is when the question (of revoking) will arise or whether the question will arise. What we can know is that we will bloody well wish (the question) was answered before it had arisen"" he said.
Separately, a legal source told Reuters that a Labour lawmaker was preparing a letter of support from other lawmakers for the Scottish Brexit litigation.
Scotland's supreme civil judicial body will now decide whether the case goes to hearing and, eventually, to the European Court of Justice to make a final decision. It may have a bearing on whether or not Brexit happens and how it happens, if public opinion should change.
""The government want us to believe that you either accept the deal on offer or you crash out on March 29 2019 with no deal"" said Joanna Cherry QC, one of the petitioners and lawmaker for the Scottish National Party.
""Both (European Council President) Donald Tusk and (French President Emmanuel) Macron have in the past week mentioned the possibility that the UK could still change its mind about leaving, the implication being that such a change of mind would be acceptable to (other EU members).""
Since the referendum, opponents of Brexit at home and abroad have said Britain could change its mind legally and avoid what they say will be disastrous consequences for the economy.

1022,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 02:05AM ET</span>","Bomb at pork stall in market in Thailand's south kills three, wounds 22","BANGKOK (Reuters) - A motorcycle bomb exploded in a market in Thailand's southern Yala province on Monday, killing three people and wounding 22, a spokesman for the Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC) said, the first such attack in the region in months.
The mostly Muslim provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala in Thailand's far south are home to a long-running insurgency by ethnic Malay Muslims fighting for autonomy in which more than 6,000 people have been killed since 2004.
""The criminals put a bomb in a motorcycle and placed it next to a market cart. The force of the explosion caused three people to lose their lives,"" said ISOC spokesman Pramote Prom-in. The ISOC is a government security force that operates in the region.
No group claimed immediate responsibility for the attack on Monday, which took place at a morning market.
Police said the motorcycle was placed near a stall selling pork, which is strictly forbidden for Muslims under Islamic Law.
It was not immediately clear whether the bomb was placed at the pork stall in a deliberate attempt to target Thai Buddhists.
The stall's female owner and a male customer were among the three people killed, police said. The bomb blew off chunks of the market's corrugated tin roof and wrecked nearby stalls. 
The southern provinces have seen hundreds of attacks since 2004, many of them deadly, but there had been fewer violent incidents of late.
Analysts who monitor the conflict say violence from the insurgency fell to an historic low in 2017 despite the fact that talks aimed at bringing peace gained little traction.
Thailand's military government has tried to revive talks with rebel groups initiated by the previous civilian government, but they have gone almost nowhere.

Resistance to Buddhist rule from Bangkok has existed for decades in the predominantly Muslim southern provinces, waning briefly in the 1990s before resurfacing violently in 2004.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 01:18AM ET</span>",Japan's Abe avoids timeline for amending pacifist constitution,"By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe opened a new session of parliament on Monday with familiar promises for economic reform and stronger defense, but steered clear of setting a timeline for his goal of revising the post-war, pacifist constitution.
The push by the conservative Japanese leader to fulfill his long-held ambition coincides with rising concerns about North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and China's military assertiveness.
Abe's wariness over setting a timeline reflects the delicate task he faces amending the constitution's Article 9, which if taken literally, bans a standing military. 
Successive governments have interpreted Article 9 to allow a military exclusively for self-defense.
But Abe, aiming to build a lasting legacy as he enters a sixth year as prime minister, wants to add a clause making clear that the armed forces are constitutional.
""I hope each party will submit concrete proposals to parliament ... deepen debate and move forward,"" Abe said in his speech to parliament. ""For the sake of our grandchildren, isn't now the time to make progress toward building a new country?""
Amendments require approval by two-thirds of both houses of parliament and a majority of voters in a referendum. 
Abe's ruling bloc has a two-thirds ""super majority"" in both chambers - at least until an upper house election next year - but the outlook for a referendum remains murky. 
Abe has proposed an amendment that would retain Article 9's first clause renouncing the right to go to war and a second clause banning a standing military while adding a specific reference to the ""Self-Defense Forces"" (SDF), as Japan calls its military.
Those in favor of his proposal say it would just codify the status quo. Opponents argue it would make it easier for Japan's military to take part in overseas conflicts.
A Mainichi newspaper survey published on Monday showed 31 percent agreed with Abe's proposal, while 12 percent supported a more drastic proposal that would delete the second clause while adding a reference to the SDF.
Twenty-one percent opposed any change and 27 percent said they didn't know.
A public vote on the constitution could end up a referendum on Abe, whose support last year fell sharply due to suspected cronyism scandals. 
The Mainichi poll put support for Abe at 44 percent, though only 37 percent want to see him win a third term as LDP leader in September, a win that would put him on track to become Japan's longest serving premier.
All of which means Abe may decide not to rush and risk rejection. ""Abe is flexible. He might aim for an amendment around 2020,"" Harukata Takenaka, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, told reporters recently.

MANILA (Reuters) - The head of a Philippine news site ordered closed for ownership violations met state investigators on Monday to answer what she called a ""suspicious"" complaint about a five-year-old story, as domestic fears grow of an impending crackdown on media.
Maria Ressa, chief of Rappler (www.rappler.com), maintains that the Jan. 11 Securities and Exchange Commission's revoking of Rappler's license was designed to intimidate journalists whose reporting has challenged President Rodrigo Duterte, notorious for his public tirades against opponents.
Ressa was met by a phalanx of media after answering a subpoena by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) that she said was part of ""a concerted effort to turn journalism into a crime"". 
""Although friendly, I still see this as a continuing pattern to harass and to shut down Rappler,"" Ressa said of the 50-minute meeting, which centered on a complaint by a businessmen the NBI said was made last year about a 2012 story.
""I still see it as part of a concerted effort that will have impact to press freedom in the country.""
The authorities say Rappler is not being punished, but broke the law in 2015 by granting American investor Omidyar Network the means to exercise some control over the news site, or veto powers on company decisions. Rappler says that is ""ludicrous"".
Rappler has repeatedly drawn Duterte's ire and he last week called it a ""fake news outlet"". Rappler is operating as normal pending an appeal. [L3N1PB4LW]
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said that although Duterte may not be happy with some journalists, he had done nothing to stop them.
""If the president wanted to curb press freedom, he could have done it, but he only speaks against the press,"" Roque told a regular briefing.
""That's all he can do and he has the right to be angry and curse the press.""
Though Duterte has expressed bemusement at allegations he influenced the SEC, the complaint against Rappler was made by his ally, Solicitor General Jose Calida.
Duterte has also vented fury at the Philippine Daily Inquirer, a broadsheet that has reported extensively on his bloody war on drugs, and broadcaster ABS-CBN, the license of which the president has threatened not to renew in 2020.
Rappler's reporting has included investigations into what it says is the ""weaponizing"" of the internet by a government that engages closely with pro-Duterte bloggers, whose postings influence ""trolls"" generating and directing online hate toward the president's opponents.
Duterte's office denies engineering such a system and pro-Duterte bloggers typically say they are not responsible for how trolls behave.
The NBI cybercrime division chief, Manuel Antonio Duarte, said the NBI would be fair in its investigation and Ressa's appearance showed Rappler trusted the NBI to do its job.
Ressa said the timing of her subpoena was puzzling.
""What we were told is this is coincidental,"" she said.
""Again, too much coincidence creates a pattern. And the pattern is clear. This is political in nature.""

1025,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>","'Fake news' crutch used by SE Asian leaders to control media, critics charge","By Karen Lema and Panu Wongcha-um
MANILA/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Governments across Southeast Asia have a history of using laws and the judiciary to curb press freedoms - now, they have found a handy crutch to lean on as they intensify clampdowns: U.S. President Donald Trump's ""fake news"" mantra.
Most worrying to media rights advocates is that several countries are promoting new legislation or expanding existing regulations to make publishing fake news an offense. The fear is that, rather than focusing on false stories published on social media, authoritarian leaders will use the new laws to target legitimate news outlets that are critical of them.
""When the leadership of the United States consistently targets legitimate media reporting as fake, it opens the way for leaders the world over to do the same,"" said Shawn Crispin, who represents the Committee to Protect Journalists in the region. ""It's a dangerous trend that is giving authoritarian and democratic regimes alike justification for targeting or shutting down reporting they don't like.""
The term ""fake news"" has entered the lexicon of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), whose leaders commended the work done by their governments in countering its spread in a statement issued at the end of a November summit.
Like everywhere else, Southeast Asia does sometimes have a problem with information on social media that is intentionally false. But there is little sign that the problem has been anywhere as bad as it was, for example, in the run-up to the November 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Last week, after the Philippines' corporate regulator revoked the operating license of Rappler, a news site whose scrutiny of President Rodrigo Duterte's deadly war on drugs has been a thorn in his side, Duterte told reporters it was ""a fake news outlet"" that had been ""throwing trash and shit all along"".
Duterte denied influencing the regulator's decision, which was followed by the justice minister ordering an investigation into Rappler for possible criminal liability and the National Bureau of Investigation summoning its CEO to answer a complaint related to cyber-crime.
John Nery, associate editor and a columnist at the Philippine Daily Inquirer, which has also come under attack from the government, said ""fake news"" is now glibly used by people who don't like what they hear.
""Unfortunately for us, those parties include the government of the Philippines. So it is used to intimidate,"" he said.
Anti-fake news legislation, which would impose fines and prison terms of up to 20 years for spreading false information, is under consideration in the Philippines. 
Philippines presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the legislation was being promoted by two senators not the Duterte administration.
Asked if the government felt the need to regulate fake news, Roque said: ""We believe in free market place of ideas."" 
""LIKE POISON OR A GUN""
Strongman Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen regularly accuses critical media outlets of spreading ""fake news"".
In his latest attack on Saturday, he backed Trump for announcing ""fake news"" awards. ""I think President Donald Trump has correctly created an award that he just announced in recent days, the Fake News Award,"" he said. ""And in Cambodia there is also this type of media.""
Huy Vannak, undersecretary of state in Cambodia's Interior Ministry, told Reuters: ""Everyone, including ordinary citizens, has to fight against fake news because fake news is like poison or a gun and it can kill our beautiful society.""In Malaysia, Prime Minister Najib Razak has accused opponents of using the media to spread fake news on a scandal over state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
1MDB is being investigated in at least six countries for money-laundering and misappropriation of funds, including an alleged $681 million transfer into Najib's personal account. The U.S. Department of Justice filed several lawsuits last year to seize more than $1.7 billion in assets believed to have been stolen from the sovereign fund that was set up by Najib.
The prime minister denies any wrongdoing.
Najib's government has suspended media and blocked websites that hounded him over 1MDB, and - with elections looming - he recently launched a website to counter ""fake news"".
The government of Singapore, where curbs on free speech have often been criticized by human rights advocates, is planning legislation to tackle fake online information it says could threaten national security.
Singapore's Straits Times newspaper this month cited seven cases of ""fake news"" that came up in a parliament discussion: three were about other countries and one was about an image of 'halal pork' allegedly being sold in supermarkets that went viral in 2007.
Law and Home Affairs Minister Kasiviswanathan Shanmugam told lawmakers that combating falsehoods is not contrary to the exercise of freedom of speech but, rather, it ""enables freedom of speech to be meaningfully exercised"".
A Singapore government spokesperson, asked to comment, referred Reuters to Shanmugam's speech and to a paper presented to parliament that said ""the dissemination of deliberate falsehoods ... attacks the very heart of democracy"" and, if unchecked, undermines faith in the country and its institutions.
LOCKING UP REPORTERS
Thailand already has a cyber-security law under which the spread of false information carries a jail sentence of up to seven years, and the military government strictly enforces lese majeste laws that shield the royal family from insult.
Still, junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha has warned that tough action will be taken to enforce laws against ""fake news and hate speech"".
Myanmar has assailed foreign news organizations for ""fake news"" about a military crackdown in Rakhine state that triggered the exodus of more than 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh.
It has detained at least 29 journalists since Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi came to power in 2016. Among them are two Reuters reporters who had covered the crisis in Rakhine and are being investigated for alleged breaches of the Official Secrets Act. 
Philip Bowring, a former editor of the news magazine Far Eastern Economic Review, which closed in 2009, said ""fake news"" is ""a convenient phrase"" for governments that would in any case find ways to crimp press freedom. He sees the mantra as ""just a new gimmick"" that allows governments to justify their behavior.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 11:50PM ET</span>",Japanese capital holds first North Korean missile attack drill,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo held its first missile evacuation drill on Monday with volunteers taking cover in subway stations and other underground spaces that would double as shelters for the Japanese capital in the event of a North Korean missile strike.
The choreographed evacuations at a fair ground and park ringing the Tokyo Dome baseball stadium involved around 300 volunteers.
Small groups of protesters scuffled with police as they demonstrated against what they criticized as a war game that fanned public fear.
While hope grows that North Korea's participation in next month's Winter Olympics in South Korea may help defuse tension in the region, Japan is escalating efforts to prepare its citizens for a possible war.
Tokyo believes the threat posed by Pyongyang's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons development is deepening.
""A missile from North Korea would arrive in less than 10 minutes and the first alert would come about three minutes after launch, which gives us only around five minutes to find shelter,"" Hiroyuku Suenaga, a Japanese government official, told volunteers after the Tokyo exercise.
Small Japanese towns and villages have conducted similar drills as North Korea has pushed ahead with its missile and nuclear weapons programs. 
North Korea conducted its most recent and biggest nuclear bomb test in September and has tested dozens of ballistic missiles. The latest missile test in November reached an altitude of about 4,475 km (2,780 miles) and flew 950 km (590 miles), passing over Japan before splashing into waters in Japan's exclusive economic zone.
Pyongyang says its weapons programs are a necessary defense against a possible U.S. invasion.
Amid public concern over the possibility of more missile launches, Japanese public broadcaster NHK issued a false launch alarm urging people to take shelter six days ago. That came days after a similar false alert caused panic across Hawaii.
""I am not that worried about North Korea, if something happened that would be frightening,"" said Hidenobu Kondo, one of the volunteer evacuees. However, the 50-year-old company employee said the drill would not be of much use in the event of real attack.
""If I was at work it might be easy to evacuate, but If I was outside somewhere it would be more difficult,"" Kondo said.
Japan's defenses against a ballistic missile strike include Aegis destroyers in the Sea of Japan armed with interceptor missiles designed to destroy warheads in space. PAC-3 Patriot missile batteries represent a last line of defense against warheads that can plunge to their targets at several kilometers per second.

Japan has also decided to buy two land-based Aegis batteries and cruise missiles that could strike North Korean missile sites.

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>",Trust in U.S. institutions plunges in Trump's first year,"By Noah Barkin 
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Trust in U.S. institutions, particularly the government, has plunged in President Donald Trump's first year in office, according to a leading survey released on the eve of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
The annual Edelman Trust Barometer showed overall trust in the four institutions it measures - the government, media, business and non-governmental organizations - falling more steeply in the United States than in any of the 28 countries surveyed.
Trump has broken with presidential tradition and repeatedly denounced the media and judiciary - attacks his critics say risk undermining public confidence in those institutions.
By contrast, the country that saw the biggest trust gains among its own citizens was China, after a year in which President Xi Jinping cemented his hold on power at a triumphal party congress.
Faith in the Chinese government jumped 8 points to 84 percent. In the United States it fell 14 points to 33 percent. 
""The United States is enduring an unprecedented crisis of trust,"" said Richard Edelman, head of the communications marketing firm that commissioned the research.
Xi was the headliner in Davos last year, days before Trump was inaugurated. This year, Trump is the main attraction. He is expected to defend his ""America First"" policies in a speech on the final day of the conference of policymakers, CEOs, bankers and celebrities in the Swiss Alps, which runs from Jan. 23-26.
Pointing to the steep erosion in trust in the United States, Edelman said it was the first time since the survey began 18 years ago that such a precipitous drop was not linked to a specific event, such as an economic crisis or catastrophe, like the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan.
Instead it comes at a time when the U.S. economy is showing robust growth and stock markets are at record highs.
""Normally when things are going well, trust is pretty good,"" Edelman said. ""Increasingly there is a disconnect between trust and economic outcomes.""
FAKE NEWS
He attributed this to a politicisation of the public discourse in the United States and elsewhere that has left many people confused about what is fact and what is fiction.
The survey showed nearly 2 in 3 people are unable to distinguish reliable news from rumors and falsehoods. While trust in journalism rose to its highest level in years, faith in search engines and social media platforms like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell in 21 of the 28 countries, making media the least trusted of the four institutions globally.
The Edelman survey, based on the opinions of over 33,000 people and conducted between Oct. 28 and Nov. 20 of last year, showed an even deeper lack of trust in U.S. institutions among the ""informed public"" - people who are college educated, earn above-average incomes and consume news regularly.
Among this group, trust declined a whopping 23 points, putting the United States in last place among the 28 countries surveyed, below Russia and South Africa. In 2017 it ranked sixth.
In the broader U.S. population, faith in the government was equally low among respondents who said they voted for Trump and those who supported his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. But trust in the media was significantly higher among Clinton backers.
The survey also showed that Americans' trust in their own companies fell more steeply than in any other country, with Switzerland and Canada registering the highest levels of trust in their homegrown brands. It showed a revival of faith in ""experts"", including academics and businessmen.

China's foreign ministry said the USS Hopper, a destroyer, came within 12 nautical miles of Huangyan island, which is better known as the Scarborough Shoal and is subject to a rival claim by the Philippines, a historic ally of the United States.
It was the latest U.S. naval operation challenging extensive Chinese claims in the South China Sea and came even as President Donald Trump's administration seeks Chinese cooperation in dealing with North Korea's missile and nuclear programs.
The ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily said in a commentary that, with the situation generally improving in the South China Sea, it was clear that the United States was the one militarizing the region.
""Against this backdrop of peace and cooperation, a U.S. ship wantonly provoking trouble is singleminded to the point of recklessness,"" the paper said.
""If the relevant party once more makes trouble out of nothing and causes tensions, then it will only cause China to reach this conclusion: in order to earnestly protect peace in the South China Sea, China must strengthen and speed up the building of its abilities there,"" it said.
The commentary was published under the pen name ""Zhong Sheng"", meaning ""Voice of China"", which is often used to give the paper's view on foreign policy issues.
The widely read Global Times tabloid, published by the People's Daily, said in an editorial on Monday China's control of the South China Sea is only growing and it is well placed to react to U.S. ""provocations"".
""As China's military size and quality improve, so does its control of the South China Sea,"" it said. ""China is able to send more naval vessels as a response and can take steps like militarizing islands."" 
The Scarborough Shoal is located within the Philippines' 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone but an international tribunal in 2016 ruled that it is a traditional fishing ground that no one country has sole rights to exploit.
The U.S. military says it carries out ""freedom of navigation"" operations throughout the world, including in areas claimed by allies, and that they are separate from political considerations.

The Pentagon has not commented directly on the latest patrol but said such operations are routine.

RIYADH (Reuters) - A military coalition led by Saudi Arabia said on Monday it would commit $1.5 billion in new humanitarian aid for Yemen where it is supporting the internationally recognized government against Iran-aligned Houthis in a three-year-old civil war.
The U.S.-backed alliance, which also includes the United Arab Emirates, said in a statement it would operate an air bridge to Marib, set up 17 overland corridors for aid deliveries and lead the expansion of additional Yemeni ports to receive humanitarian and essential cargo.
""We are backing a professionally planned and detailed humanitarian mission with military power and precision to guarantee that the humanitarian aid reaches the people who need it to lift their suffering,"" said spokesman Colonel Turki al-Maliki.
Yemen is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, where 8.3 million people are entirely dependent on external food aid and 400,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition, a potentially lethal condition, according to the United Nations.
The coalition has already pumped billions of dollars worth of aid into the country, yet the war has still cut food deliveries by more than half and pushed the Arabian Peninsula's poorest country to the edge of famine with outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria.
The new aid program seeks to boost monthly imports to 1.4 million metric tons from 1.1 million last year, the statement said.
An accompanying graphic suggested that overland delivery routes would extend into northern territory held by the armed Houthi movement, which is fighting the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi based in the south.
Last week, Saudi Arabia deposited $2 billion in Yemen's central bank after the Yemeni prime minister made a public plea for funds to prop up the currency and help stave off hunger.
Monday's announcement comes as Saudi Arabia and its allies face mounting criticism - including from U.S. and European partners - over the civilian toll of the conflict, in which more than 10,000 people have been killed by coalition air strikes and fighting on the ground.
The coalition, under international pressure, eased a three-week blockade imposed on Yemeni ports and airports in November in response to a ballistic missile fired by the Houthis toward the Saudi capital Riyadh.
U.S. President Donald Trump last month called for Saudi Arabia to immediately allow humanitarian aid to reach the Yemeni people, suggesting Washington had run out of patience with the blockade.
The war's heavy toll on civilians has long been a sore point with members of Congress, triggering threats to block U.S. assistance to the coalition including refueling of jets and limited intelligence support.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters gathered for the Women's March ""Power to the Polls"" rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, kicking off a national drive to register a million new voters as well as put more female candidates in office and stymie President Donald Trump's agenda.
The march came a day after hundreds of thousands of women and male supporters took to the streets of New York, Washington and other cities for a series of Women's March protests that marked the first anniversary of Trump's inauguration.
The mass demonstrations, while drawing fewer attendees than the millions of people who marched last year, suggested that the anger felt by many women after Trump's surprise election was still palpable.
“When our country was in free fall, the Women’s March got us out of our despair and out of our homes and into the streets,” said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood and a key speaker at the rally. “And ever since that day, women have been shaking the foundation of America.”
Connie Whittig, a 73-year-old Milwaukee resident, came to the rally with her sister, Ann Pesch, a year after they attended the march in Washington.
""Our voices haven't been heard, and now it's time. We can't be silent anymore,"" Whittig said. ""We're still second-class citizens.""
Marches were also held on Sunday in U.S. cities ranging from Miami to Knoxville as well as in London and Paris.
March organizers said they designated Las Vegas as the site of the main event because of its status as a key political swing state, as well as to honor the victims of the mass shooting that killed 58 people and left more than 850 injured in October.
“We want to let people to know Vegas is strong, and that’s really why they chose this place,” said Chris Giunchigliani, a Clark County commissioner and a Democratic candidate for Nevada governor. ""It’s not only about empowering women and diversity.""
The event, held in a 40,000-seat football stadium, took on a festive atmosphere on a warm Sunday morning. 
Dozens of volunteers fanned out looking to register people to vote among the thousands in attendance, as representatives of progressive Democratic candidates passed out literature.
Protesters waved signs bearing slogans that included ""Dissent is patriotic,"" ""Stand against racism,"" ""Make America sane again,"" and ""A shutdown means the president is weak.""
Sarah Casey and Leslie Morgan, both of Las Vegas, registered to vote at the stadium.

""It's partly about not liking Trump, but it's also the GOP and how they're just playing dirty politics,"" Morgan said, referring to the Republicans. ""It's also all the things he's rolling back that Obama did. Anything to do with the environment and anything to do with immigrants.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's offer to send athletes to a North Korean ski resort for joint training ahead of next month's Olympics risks giving leader Kim Jong Un's regime legitimacy and some much needed cash, North Korean defectors and experts say. 
Already facing criticism for plans to march under a unity flag and field a combined Korean ice hockey team, the administration of South Korean President Moon Jae-in may come under further pressure if it is seen to be endorsing Kim's luxury getaway on North Korea's east coast.
""The idea of joint training could be used as a propaganda tool to rationalize how far-sighted Kim Jong Un was in making what was actually an anachronistic decision to build the ski resort at a time when ordinary citizens are starving to death"", said Kim Sung-han, a former South Korean vice foreign minister.
North Korea's participation in the Olympics was a goal for Moon, who hopes to use the event to defuse tensions and break a months-long standoff over the North's nuclear and missile tests. 
The two Koreas agreed during rare talks last week to hold joint training sessions at the North's Masik Pass resort ahead of the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
Seoul officials are scheduled this week to inspect the resort's facilities and the newly built Kalma Airport nearby that may be used to fly in the South Korean skiers, who are not expected to attend the Games. 
SKI RUNS AND MISSILE LAUNCHES
Launched by Kim in late 2013, Masik Pass is near the seaside city of Wonsan, where the third generation leader is developing a luxury resort including hotels, an aquarium and a golf course. 
Wonsan and Kalma Airport are also important defense areas, used for large scale artillery drills and as the launch site for dozens of missile tests in recent years. (http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/NORTHKOREA-TOURISM/0100516J2NK/index.html) 
Masik Pass was meant to rake in hard currency from not only foreign tourists but also a growing number of North Koreans who have built wealth from an increasingly market-based economy.
Kim visited the construction site on multiple occasions, taking test rides and chastening workers to speed up construction, which gave birth to a new propaganda slogan, ""Masikryong Speed"".
State media extolled the resort as a gift from the people-loving leader to raise the standard of living. 
But the resort has been criticized by former South Korean officials as an emblem of the Swiss-educated leader diverting scarce resources to satisfy his own lavish lifestyle while average North Koreans suffer. 
North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency on Sunday criticized some South Korean politicians and media who have questioned Pyongyang's motives regarding the Olympics detente. 
""There is no doubt about the sincerity and authenticity of (North Korea) to improve the North-South relations and to ensure successful Olympics,"" KCNA said. 
SANCTION CONCERNS
Kang Eung Chan, a defector who had lived in Wonsan, said he took a three-day trip to the ski resort in 2013. 
At around $100 per day including food and ski rentals, the holiday was far too expensive for most North Koreans to enjoy - even to a successful businessman like Kang, who ran a quasi-private clothing factory for Chinese clients.
""We paid everything in U.S. dollars. It is not that cheap by North Koreans' standard,"" Kang told Reuters. 
North Korea does not release any official statistics, but experts estimate the country's average monthly salary at around $30-$40. 
Tourism is one of the North's last remaining sources of foreign currency yet to be hit by United Nations Security Council sanctions. 
Experts point to possible issues around sanctions if South Korea ends up paying any fees to use the resort or providing costly new equipment to facilitate the ski training. 
South Korea's Unification Ministry said no decision has been made on the visit yet.
""We're aware that there is some view that we may dilute sanctions by offering financial support to the North Korean delegation"", ministry spokeswoman Lee Eugene told a news briefing on Friday.
""Our position remains unchanged that we will continue global cooperation on sanctions and pressure ... and we will make sure there will be no problem by consulting closely with the international community and the U.N. expert panel"".
A United Nations panel monitoring sanctions on North Korea said in a report last year it had included ski lift equipment in its regulations after cable-car systems produced by an Austrian firm were spotted at Masik Pass.
James Kim, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said South Korea would need a ""very well-thought-out plan"" to address the sanctions concerns.
""The Moon administration's goal here is to reduce tension and use the Winter Games as a springboard for a peaceful resolution to the North Korean nuclear issue"", he said. 
""But I think the critics are right to point out that we may want to think about the means by which Seoul wishes to achieve this objective.""
UK embassy officials in Pyongyang who visited the site said last year children had been mobilized to remove snow and polish up the resort, calling the practice ""deeply concerning"". 
""It's well known that forced labor is regularly used on both large and small infrastructure projects in North Korea, and this includes required labor by students, meaning that child labor is used as well"", said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch.
""There is no reason that the Masik ski resort would be any different from this established model"".
With the two Koreas planning a host of Olympic-related functions including a joint cultural event in the North's Mount Kumkang resort, concerts in both countries and a Taekwondo demonstration in the South, there was a risk the events may overshadow the Games, said the former diplomat Kim.
""The Olympics per se is a non-political sport event, but if other auxiliary events get too large, the Games' pure identity could be tarnished and politicized"", said Kim, who now teaches at Korea University in Seoul.

""I just hope we step back for a moment and take it easy.""

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 06:15PM ET</span>",Pope ends Latin American trip with warning about political corruption,"By Caroline Stauffer and Philip Pullella
LIMA (Reuters) - Pope Francis celebrated an open air Mass for more than 1 million people on Sunday, ending a trip to Chile and Peru marked by tough talk on political corruption but a backlash over what many see as his insufficient resolve to tackle sexual abuse in the Church.
In the final hours of his six-day visit to the two nations, Francis warned in improvised remarks that Latin America was in a deep crisis from corruption scandals, with politics in most countries ""more sick than well.""
""Politics is in crisis, very much in crisis in Latin America,"" he said, pointing to construction company Odebrecht, which has admitted to paying billions in bribes, as an example of greed run amok across the continent of his birth.
The Catholic Church's record on sexual abuse loomed large in both countries, but mostly in Chile, where Francis sparked outrage by saying criticism of a bishop he appointed who is accused of protecting a pedophile was ""all slander."" 
Francis told reporters in Chile there was no evidence against the bishop, spurring Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston to sympathize with victims who were pained by the pope's comments in an unusually blunt statement. 
O'Malley, a top adviser, was celebrating Mass with Francis at Las Palmas Air Base under a biting sun just before the pope was due to leave for Rome.
Despite the estimated 1.3 million attendance in Lima, the Church is losing followers in Latin America. Even before the pope's off-the-cuff remarks in Chile, a poll by Santiago-based think tank Latinobarometer showed the number of Chileans calling themselves Catholic had plummeted to 45 percent from 74 percent in 1995. 
The number of Catholics in Peru, where Francis consistently had a more enthusiastic reception, remains high at around 72 percent, according to a Datum poll, though it has fallen in the past decade.
""Francis here there is proof!"" read a banner hanging from a Lima apartment with a picture of Luis Figari, the founder of an elite Catholic society who is scheduled to go on trial in Peru this year for sexual abuse of minors. Figari has denied wrongdoing.
Francis ordered the Vatican to appoint an administrator to run the society, Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, a week before his trip.
'CONSUMERIST GREED'
As the first pope to visit the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in more than 30 years, Francis made a ringing defense of indigenous people and the environment on Friday, saying big business and ""consumerist greed"" could not be allowed to destroy a natural habitat vital for the entire planet. 
He extended his condemnation of greed to corruption, saying in an appearance beside embattled Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski that all parts of society, including the Church, needed to work to combat it.
In Peru alone, one former president has been detained for allegedly receiving bribes from Odebrecht while a warrant is out for another. Kuczynski was nearly impeached in December for not revealing that a company he used to run did business with Odebrecht. He denies wrongdoing.
Francis has previously mentioned corruption on trips to Latin America, where he has also visited Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Mexico, Cuba and Colombia but not his native Argentina. His words in Peru, however, were particularly.
Days after surviving an impeachment vote in Congress, Kuczynski pardoned former President Alberto Fujimori less than halfway through his 25-year sentence for corruption and human rights abuse. 
This was widely seen as a political deal struck with Fujimori supporters in Congress to allow Kuczynski, 79, to stay in office. 
Kuczynski cited medical reasons for granting Fujimori, also 79, the pardon and has said it was fundamentally about forgiveness. He denies it was part of a backroom deal.
Francis did not agree to requests to meet with relatives of victims of the death squads unleashed during Fujimori's rule from 1990 to 2000, but he did issue a ringing call for unity.

""Dear Peruvian brothers and sisters, you have so many reasons for hope ... There is no better way to protect your hope than to remain united,"" he said in his closing Mass.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Bureau of Investigation has lost about five months worth of text messages between two staffers who worked on probes into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails and possible collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, according to a Republican lawmaker.
Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, revealed in a Jan. 20 letter that the FBI's technical system failed to preserve texts that were exchanged between Lisa Page, a lawyer, and Peter Strzok, an agent, between mid-December 2016 through mid-May of 2017.
A spokesman for the FBI and a spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment.
Congressional Republicans have been focusing on Strzok and Page in recent weeks after learning the two had exchanged anti-Trump text messages on their work-issued cell phones.
Republicans have said the texts, which referred to Trump as an ""idiot"" and a ""loathsome human,"" raised concerns the FBI is biased against Trump and may have given Clinton favorable treatment after deciding not to recommend criminal charges in connection with the probe into her use of a private email system while she was secretary of state.
Strzok and Page were involved in that investigation and also were briefly assigned to work with Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the Russia investigation. 
After Mueller learned about the texts, Strzok was re-assigned to a different post. Page's 45-day detail on Mueller's team ended in July.
In his letter, Johnson said he learned of the software problem from the FBI on Jan. 19, after it gave 384 texts to the committee, one of several in Congress that recently launched inquiries into how the FBI handled the Clinton investigation.
""The loss of records from this period is concerning because it is apparent from other records that Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page communicated frequently about the investigation,"" Johnson wrote. 
He cited examples, including an exchange between Strzok and Page that took place in May 2016, after it became apparent that Trump would likely be the Republican presidential candidate.
""Now the pressure really starts to finish [midyear exam],"" Strzok wrote, in what Johnson's letter says is a reference to the Clinton investigation.
""It sure does,"" Page responded. 

In his letter, Johnson asked the FBI to follow up with more details about the scope of the lost records, and to tell the committee whether it has conducted searches of their non-government issued devices.

The decision by Cuevas, who is head of the Senate's foreign relations committee, represents a win for Lopez Obrador as he seeks to oust the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in his third attempt to clinch the presidency. 
""I've decided to join the movement that Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has created,"" Cuevas told reporters as she announced her departure from the party she had been with since she was 15. 
In a statement, the PAN said Cuevas chose to leave after it was unable to guarantee her a federal representative's position in the future. 
The PAN has entered into an electoral alliance with the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), with former PAN leader Ricardo Anaya at its head.
The coalition has put a squeeze on the number of safe seats the PRD and PAN can each distribute among leading politicians.
Lopez Obrador, or AMLO as he is commonly known, has vowed to combat inequality and corruption. But some international investors are concerned by suggestions that he might reverse parts of the government's 2013-14 energy legislation, which ended a decades-long monopoly by state oil firm Pemex.
Anaya's coalition is second in opinion polls. 

PRI contender Jose Antonio Meade is in third place, weighed down by the PRI's poor record on corruption.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia police fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators demanding jobs in the southern town of Metlaoui on Sunday, witnesses said, days after violent protests across the country against price hikes subsided.
The protesters closed roads and burned tires to demand jobs after the state-owned phosphate company Gafsa (CPG) released the results of a recruitment campaign.
""Police are pursuing protesters and firing gas bombs, as youths closed the streets in Metlaoui,"" Issam Chahbani, a resident, told Reuters. 
""There is feeling of injustice and marginalization here ... We're only asking for jobs and development."" 
In Mdihla town in the same region, protesters clashed with police to press for jobs in CPG, witnesses told Reuters. 
Violent protests erupted this month in several towns and cities across Tunisia following tax and price hikes imposed on Jan. 1 by a government seeking to reduce a budget deficit to meet an agreement with its international donors. One demonstrator was killed during the protests. 
The unrest subsided last week after the government responded by pledging extra aid for poor families and those in need.
Tunisian unemployment is running at 15.6 percent, rising to about 30 percent among the young. 
Once one of the world’s largest producers of phosphates, Tunisia saw its market share fall after a 2011 uprising against then president Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali. Since then protests and strikes have steadily cut into production and caused billions of dollars in losses. The CPG is the biggest employer in Gafsa, one of Tunisia's poorest areas.
Tunisia has been hailed as the only democratic success of the Arab Spring: the one Arab country to topple a long-serving leader in that year’s uprisings without triggering widespread violence or civil war.
But Tunisia has had nine governments since Ben Ali’s overthrow, none of which have been able to resolve deep-rooted economic problems. The economy has worsened since the vital tourism sector was nearly wiped out by a wave of deadly militant attacks in 2015, and has yet to recover despite improved security.

Investigators opened 25,339 murder probes last year, up nearly 25 percent from the 2016 tally, interior ministry data released on Saturday showed. It was the highest annual total since the government began counting murders in 1997.
Mexico has struggled with years of violence as the government has battled vicious drug cartels that have increasingly splintered into smaller, more bloodthirsty, gangs.
Violence is a central issue in July's presidential election. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto faces an uphill battle to keep his ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in office. 
There were 40 percent more murder investigations opened last year compared with 2013, Pena Nieto's first full year in office. 

Mexico on Thursday dismissed a claim by U.S. President Donald Trump that it was the most dangerous country in the world.

1039,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 02:23PM ET</span>",Pence arrives in Israel on visit overshadowed by Trump's Jerusalem declaration,"By Jeff Mason
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence began a visit to Israel on Sunday after being praised as a ""great friend"" by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and shunned by the Palestinians over U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
It is the highest-level U.S. visit to the region since President Donald Trump made his declaration on Dec. 6 and promised to begin the process of moving the American embassy to the city, whose status is at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
With the Palestinians boycotting Pence, the visit provides little obvious opportunity to build bridges toward peace.
But it gave Pence, a conservative Christian, and Netanyahu, a right-winger who has hailed U.S. evangelicals for their support of Israel, an opportunity to shine a spotlight on the visit and their own warm relationship for a community that serves as a power base for Trump and his vice president.
Before arriving in Israel, Pence held meetings with the leaders of Egypt and Jordan and U.S. officials traveling with him said that he had sought to encourage them to pressure the Palestinians to return to peace talks.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, calling Trump's declaration a ""slap in the face', has rejected Washington as an honest broker in any future talks with Israel. Abbas left for an overseas visit before Pence arrived.
Pence, who flew into Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion Airport from Jordan on a U.S. military plane after visiting U.S. troops on the Syrian border, was met by Israel's tourism minister, Yariv Levin. Pence, who traveled to the Middle East despite a U.S. government shutdown, made no statement on arrival in Israel.
Netanyahu, addressing his cabinet earlier on Sunday, described Pence as a ""great friend of the State of Israel"" and said they would discuss U.S. efforts ""to halt Iran's aggression, the Iranian nuclear program, and ways to advance peace and security in the region.""
""Anyone who truly wants to fulfill those goals knows there is no substitute to the United States' leadership,"" said Netanyahu, who is due to hold talks with Pence on Monday.
Trump's shift on Jerusalem overturned decades of U.S. policy that its status should be decided in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. His declaration drew universal condemnation from Arab leaders and widespread criticism elsewhere.
Israel's government regards Jerusalem as the eternal and indivisible capital of the country, although that is not recognized internationally. Palestinians feel equally strongly, saying that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a future Palestinian state.
In comments delivered in Egypt, his first stop on the Middle East visit, Pence said Washington would support a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians if the two sides agreed to it.
""CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES""
Visiting Jordan on Sunday before flying to Israel, Pence told its monarch, King Abdullah, that Washington was committed to preserving the status quo of holy sites in Jerusalem, a city sacred to Jews, Muslims and Christians.
Pointing to ""challenging circumstances"", the king said he hoped Washington would ""reach out and find the right way to move forward"". Pence told reporters he ""agreed to disagree"" with King Abdullah on the impact of Trump's move.
U.S.-sponsored peace talks collapsed in 2014 and Trump has pledged to pursue a ""deal of the century"" between Israel and the Palestinians, who are seeking a state in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Jason Greenblatt, Trump's special envoy to the peace process, remained in Israel for Pence's visit after arriving on Wednesday.
After meeting Netanyahu, Pence will address the Israeli parliament, whose Arab members said they would boycott the event. On the second day of his two-day visit on Tuesday, he will attend Judaism's Western Wall in Jerusalem and will lay a wreath at the Yad Vashem Holocaust remembrance center in the city.
Pence is thought to have pushed hard for both Jerusalem's recognition as Israel's capital and relocation of the U.S. embassy to the city. It is a decision that was popular with many conservative and evangelical Christians who voted for Trump and Pence.

As Pence arrived, a small group of Palestinian protesters outside Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity, the traditional birthplace of Jesus Christ, burned a poster of the vice president which also bore the words: ""Pence go home.""

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 01:41PM ET</span>","Spurned by Trump, Europeans ponder how to meet Iran ultimatum","By John Irish, Robin Emmott and Arshad Mohammed
PARIS/BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A day before Donald Trump's Jan. 12 ultimatum to ""fix"" the Iran nuclear deal, European powers met Iran's foreign minister to show support for it, but the effort failed to soften Trump's aversion to the accord, U.S. and European officials said.
The gathering in Brussels may even have reinforced the U.S. president's antipathy, according to three U.S. officials involved in the discussions.
Trump instead gave the European allies, Britain, France, Germany, and the U.S. Congress 120 days to come up with a tougher approach on Tehran or see U.S. sanctions reimposed, they said.
With Trump warning of a last chance for ""the worst deal ever negotiated"", Britain, France and Germany have begun talks on a plan to satisfy him by addressing Iran's ballistic missile tests and its regional influence while preserving the 2015 accord that curbed Iran's nuclear ambitions for at least a decade.
It is hard to say what might mollify the Trump administration, which is split between those who would like to tear up the agreement and those who wish to preserve it and which has said inconsistent things about its demands to keep the accord, U.S. and European officials said.
Under U.S. law, Trump must decide again whether to renew the U.S. sanctions relief every 120 days, giving Congress, as well as U.S. and European diplomats, until mid-May to see if there is a way to finesse the issue.
But the Brussels meeting has left European powers wary that whatever they agree, it may not be enough.
""We're going to work in the spirit that we're ready to talk about everything, from the nuclear accord to Iran's ballistic missiles,"" said a senior European diplomat. ""But we want to compartmentalise the subjects; we're not going to mix them.""
At stake is not just an historic accord negotiated - before Trump took office - by the United States, China, France, Russia, Britain, Germany and the European Union, and one that Europe sees as its biggest diplomatic achievement in decades.
A collapse of the nuclear deal could see a breakdown in the relations between the United States and Europe that have underpinned the West's security since World War Two, European diplomats and the senior U.S. official said, and could confirm Europe's fears that it can no longer count on U.S. leadership.
Britain, France, Germany and the EU's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, are adamant that the deal cannot be renegotiated, while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also ruled that out this month, speaking at the United Nations.
Initial contacts between the three European powers in Washington, European capitals and at the EU's headquarters in Brussels suggest that Paris, London and Berlin will present a package of measures to the United States to allay Trump's concerns about Iran but that do not reopen the nuclear accord.
BALLISTIC THREAT
The strategy could include threatening Iran with targeted economic sanctions if it does not agree to curtail its ballistic weapons arsenal, which the West believes contains longer-range missiles potentially capable of carrying nuclear warheads. 
European diplomats favor creating a high-level working group with Iran to discuss the missile issue, while reminding Trump that NATO's ballistic missile defense shield in southeastern Europe will boast a new site in Poland this year.
Washington wants U.N. nuclear inspectors to be able to visit military sites as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency's verification of the nuclear deal. The IAEA says it does not distinguish between military and non-military sites and has repeatedly said Iran is honoring its commitments under the deal.
Diplomats say the IAEA has not yet inspected a military site, and if Washington wants it to do so it needs to provide new information showing that this is necessary.
For its part, Iran has said its military sites are beyond the IAEA's purview and repeatedly denied that its nuclear program has military dimensions, namely to develop bombs.
Another part of the potential European strategy is pressure on Iran to rein in Middle East proxies such as Hezbollah, and to stop arming Houthi fighters combating government forces in Yemen's war, which has devastated the country.
There is discussion to push Iran to embrace U.N-backed peace talks for Syria, where Tehran is sharply at odds with the West in its support for President Bashar al-Assad and whose departure the United States and its EU allies have long sought.
That could dovetail with U.S. legislative efforts to change the nuclear deal's so-called sunset provisions as they expire from 2025, so that if Iran were eventually to launch a nuclear arms program, U.S. sanctions would kick in again.
In the U.S. Congress, the leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are working with the White House to write legislation they hope can meet Trump's demand to eliminate ""the disastrous flaws"" in the pact.
""Presented the right way, it could be just enough to allow Trump to claim a diplomatic victory and sign legislation from Congress,"" said a senior EU diplomat. 
Mogherini will brief EU foreign ministers on Monday, while U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will meet his British and French counterparts in London and Paris this week on a trip where Iran ""will dominate"" many conversations, an aide said.
""RAGING DISAGREEMENTS""
While Britain, Germany and France appear united, Mogherini has so far been unwilling to consider EU sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missiles to avoid jeopardizing the nuclear deal.
Iran already rejected a call in November by French President Emmanuel Macron for talks on its missiles, saying they were solely defensive in nature. ""Their concept of dialogue is to explain that they are right,"" a Western diplomat said of Iran. 
Britain, France and Germany also face a divided U.S. government - current and former U.S. officials said it is unclear whether Trump wants to save the pact or has set the Europeans and Congress an impossible task, giving him an excuse to end the deal and for someone to take the fall.

""There are these raging disagreements within the (Trump) administration,"" "" said a former U.S. official. ""While one group wants to keep the agreement, the other wants this outreach to the Europeans and the Congress to fail and to be able to blame it on them.""

JDD reported that French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe had written a letter to the organizing committee to say that the bid would be dropped because of budget reasons.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire confirmed the decision in an interview with BFM TV. 
""I understand the disappointment but we have to be responsible,"" he said. 
In September 2017, France lodged a bid with the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE), which is due to decide on the bids in November. Three other countries are candidates to host World Expo 2025: Japan (Osaka), Russia (Ekaterinburg) and Azerbaijan (Baku). 
World Expos take place every five years, draw tens of millions of visitors and last up to six months, the BIE said on its website. The next one is in Dubai in 2020.
Philippe's letter said that the Expofrance 2025 committee was forecasting 35 to 40 million visitors, while the Milan World Expo in 2015 had only 20 million visitors. He said the government could not jeopardize public finances by giving guarantees for the event. 
Paris, which will host the 2023 Rugby World Cup and the 2024 Olympics, had hoped to focus the 2025 World Expo in the Saclay suburb south of the city, which is a center for science and technology.

The National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group and the government have been in formal peace talks for nearly a year, but the guerrillas launched a new offensive this month, killing security force members, bombing major oil pipelines and kidnapping an oil contractor after the expiration of a 101-day ceasefire.
In response to the renewed attacks, Santos recalled Gustavo Bell, the head of the government's team at the Quito talks, to discuss the future of the negotiations. 
""Gustavo Bell will travel to Quito to explore the possibility of a new ceasefire that will allow a continuation of peace negotiations with the ELN,"" Santos said on Twitter.
United Nations Secretary General António Guterres called on the two sides to return to the talks during a visit to Colombia this month.
The ELN is considered hardline in its ideology and was not known for compromise during past attempts at peace.
Inspired by the Cuban revolution and the Liberation Theology beliefs of the Catholic priests who founded it in 1964, the 2,000-strong ELN has sought an end to the war before, holding talks in Cuba and Venezuela between 2002 and 2007.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia's long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen berated journalists on Sunday at a dinner his government hosted for correspondents and accused some of spreading fabricated stories.
Hun Sen regularly accuses outlets that are critical of his government of spreading fake news.
In recent months his ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) has gone after critics including members of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), which was banned by a court last year, civil rights groups and independent media.
The English-language The Cambodia Daily newspaper - one of the few remaining independent newspapers left in the country - shut last year after it was handed a $6.3 million tax bill which its publishers said was politically motivated. A further 18 independent radio stations were stopped from broadcasting.
Hun Sen referred to an announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump this month that he would hand out awards for what he calls ""fake news"". Trump often uses the term ""fake news"" to cast doubt on reports critical of him or his administration.
""I think President Donald Trump has correctly created an award that he just announced in recent days, the Fake News Award,"" he said. ""And in Cambodia there is also this type of media.""
At the dinner, the second state dinner he has hosted for journalists, Hun Sen also accused some reporters of extorting money from loggers. 
Illegal exports of timber from Cambodia to Vietnam are a sensitive and politically charged issue in Cambodia which is seeing rapid deforestation. Hun Sen has called for a bigger effort to curb illegal logging and the country has a long-standing ban on log exports.
""We must not let it continue to exist, this media that acts as a mafia,"" Hun Sen told the gathering of over 3,000 journalists and media officials.
He also singled out, but did not identify, a news organization for refusing to pay taxes.
""They don't respect laws, they are not registered by law and they avoid paying taxes,"" Hun Sen said.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia special forces killed a local leader in al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) during an operation in which a top aide to the group's leader died, the interior ministry said on Sunday.
Security forces killed Bilel Kobi, the top aide to Abu Musab Abdul Wadud, in an ambush near the Algerian border when he was on a mission to reorganize AQIM's Tunisian branch following Tunisian air strikes, security forces said on Saturday.
The Okba Ibn Nafaa, the local branch of AQIM, has mostly been based in the Semmama and Chaambi mountain range along the border with Algeria and the army has been trying to flush them out for several years. Militants have in the past carried out raids on checkpoints and towns nearby.
The interior ministry said their forces on Sunday found the body of another militant killed during Saturday's operation.
""This terrorist is an Algerian named Bechir Ben Neji and he was the leader of Okba Ibn Nafaa in the Semmama mountain,"" it said. Last year security forces killed militants including Algerian Mourad Chaieb, former leader of Okba Ibn Nafaa.
Tunisia has been on high alert since 2015 when militants killed dozens of tourists.
Islamic State claim most major attacks in Tunisia including a hotel attack and an attack on a museum that killed dozens of tourists in 2015 as well as raids by militants who crossed from Libya into Tunisia in 2016.
More than 3,000 Tunisians have left over the last few years to fight for Islamic State and other militant groups in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Authorities are trying to prepare for the threat posed by their return.

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 12:28PM ET</span>",Spain to seek ex-Catalan leader's arrest if he travels to Denmark,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's state prosecution service said on Sunday it would seek the arrest of former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont if he traveled from Belgium to Denmark on Monday to attend a debate he is billed to host.
Puigdemont fled to Brussels in October after his regional government declared independence from Spain on Oct. 27 following a referendum ruled illegal by Spanish authorities. Madrid also sacked his cabinet and imposed direct rule over the wealthy region.
The Spanish Supreme Court issued an international arrest warrant against him but withdrew it in December to avoid the risk of Belgian authorities granting him asylum.
The prosecution service said it would immediately ask the judge overseeing Puigdemont's case to reinstate the warrant and request that Danish authorities arrest him once it confirmed his travel plans.
The University of Copenhagen said on Friday that Puigdemont would attend the event on Monday at its political science department: ""Catalonia and Europe at a Crossroads for Democracy? Debate with Carles Puigdemont.""
Puigdemont's lawyer, Jaume Alonso-Cuevillas, told Catalan public radio on Sunday that the risk of his client being arrested in Denmark was ""quite high"", though he also believed Danish authorities would decline to serve any warrant.
A spokesman for the Danish state prosecutor said, ""We will await the situation,"" declining to elaborate further at this stage.
Puigdemont has not yet commented on the Denmark trip, though on Friday he re-tweeted a Twitter post from Danish politician Pelle Dragsted saying he looked forward to welcoming Puigdemont to the Danish parliament the following week. 
It would be the first time that Puigdemont leaves Belgium since his arrival in October in the company of four of his cabinet members.
He is likely to be detained if he returns to Spain, pending investigation on charges of sedition, rebellion, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust.
Puigdemont's Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) party emerged as the largest separatist force in a Dec. 21 regional election that returned a majority of seats in parliament to pro-independence parties.
Puigdemont is searching for ways for parliament to appoint him as the new Catalan president remotely from Brussels and has suggested he could rule via video link.

Rajoy has dismissed the possibility of long-distance rule by Puigdemont as absurd and Madrid has said it will contest any such decision in the courts. The Catalan parliamentary committee must decide by Jan. 31 if it will allow him to do so.

LIMA (Reuters) - Pope Francis brought down the house, or more precisely the church, on Sunday when he addressed cloistered nuns who were given special permission to leave their convents to see him.
At the start of his last day in Peru Francis addressed some 500 nuns, known as ""contemplatives,"" who usually live a life of prayer and rarely leave their convents except for medical reasons.
""Seeing you all here an unkind thought comes to my mind, that you took advantage (of me) to get out of the convent a bit to take a stroll,"" he said, drawing roars of laughter from the nuns, many of whom were elderly.
Later in his talk to the nuns gathered in a Lima church, he sent a long-distance greeting to four cloistered nuns in his native Buenos Aires. He thanked them for their prayers for him and added, ""The rest of you aren't jealous, are you?""
""Nooooo,"" they shot back, like schoolgirls to a teacher.
He also urged them not to succumb to gossiping in their convents, comparing it to ""terrorism"" - something he regularly tells priests and nuns on his global travels.
""You know what a gossiping nun is?"" he asked. ""A terrorist.""
The nuns laughed again.
""Because gossip is like a bomb. One throws it, it causes destruction and you walk away tranquilly. No terrorist nuns! No gossip, and know that the best remedy against gossip is to bite your tongue,"" he said.
Trying to make his appeal local, he joked that gossiping nuns were worse ""than the terrorists of Ayacucho.""
Ayacucho was the epicenter of the Maoist-inspired Shining Path uprising that fought the Peruvian state in a conflict that left 69,000 people dead or missing in the 1980s and 1990s. 
Bands of remnant rebels still operate in the Andean area around Ayacucho and have moved into drug trafficking, occasionally attacking military and police convoys.
Some Peruvians did not find it funny, comparing a gossiping nun to members of a guerrilla group, especially on a pastoral trip aimed at unifying a politically divided Peru, and turned to social media to call the comments insensitive or disrespectful.
An editor of a local online newspaper said on Twitter he thought the cases of sex abuse by Catholic priests had more to do with ""terrorism"" than gossiping nuns.
Like Chile, which was the first country on the pope's tour, Peru has also been hit by sexual abuse scandals.

Earlier this month, the pope ordered the takeover of an elite Catholic society whose founder is scheduled to go on trial in Peru this year for sexual abuse of minors.

ADEN (Reuters) - Southern Yemeni separatists declared a state of emergency in the port city of Aden on Sunday and vowed to overthrow the internationally recognized government, the group said, in a move that puts the two allies on a collision course.
The announcement underscores rising tensions between southern separatists, who are allied with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government over control of the southern half of Yemen.
Hadi's government has been energized after Saudi Arabia deposited $2 billion into the central bank to shore up the rial.
The government has been nominally based in the southern port city of Aden since the coalition, with help from southern fighters, drove the Iran-aligned Houthis out of the city in 2015. 
Prime Minister Ahmed bin Daghr, who has been struggling to assert his government's control over southern Yemen, has announced the first state budget since 2014.
At a meeting in Aden on Sunday, the Southern Transitional Council accused bin Daghr's government of starving Yemenis and pushing the impoverished country to the verge of famine. 
""The Southern Resistance Forces (SRF) declare a state of emergency in Aden and announce that it has begun the process of overthrowing the legitimate government and replacing it with a cabinet of technocrats,"" the statement issued after the meeting said.
The statement did not give any details on what it intends to do to topple the government, but it said it was giving Hadi a week to comply and dismiss his cabinet before starting the process.
The SRF will become the core of a new force that will rebuild security in southern Yemen and military institutions, the statement said. It added that it banned military forces and officials from northern Yemen, including members of Hadi's government, in southern provinces.
One of the main differences between the two sides is that the UAE, a key member of the Saudi-led coalition, is hostile towards Islamists, but Hadi's cabinet is formed mostly by the Islah party, seen as linked with the Muslim Brotherhood. 
The new spat could jeopardize a rare opportunity offered by the killing of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh last month, that Saudi Arabia intended to seize to isolate the Houthi movement.
Southern forces have previously clashed with Hadi supporters, including members of Islah party, over control of strategic areas, including Aden airport and oil facilities.
With thousands of fighters deployed on battlefronts against the Houthis, Islah has been an important ally of Hadi and the Saudi-led coalition trying to reinstate his government.

Since the coalition intervened in Yemen, Islah has tried to distance itself from the Brotherhood in an effort to ease Gulf rulers' anxiety about its Islamist ideology.

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",Guatemala businessman to face graft charges after U.S. deportation,"(Reuters) - Former Guatemalan presidential candidate Manuel Baldizon was detained while trying to enter the United States without a visa and is awaiting deportation, the Central American nation's prosecutor's office said on Sunday, adding he would face graft charges upon his return. 
Baldizon, a wealthy businessman who ran for president twice, was detained at the airport in Miami on Saturday after flying in from the Dominican Republic, according to prosecutor's office spokeswoman Yesenia Enriquez. His deportation is expected to be swift. 
On his return to Guatemala, Baldizon will face accusations of illicit association, bribery and money laundering, the prosecutor's office said in a statement. The charges are part of a giant corruption scandal that involves Brazilian construction company Odebrecht SA and has claimed high-level political scalps across the region.
The statement said former Infrastructure Minister and brief presidential candidate Alejandro Sinibaldi was also wanted on suspected corruption charges related to the investigation, and was now a fugitive. 
The prosecutor's office did not give any information on the link with Odebrecht, which has admitted to paying multimillion-dollar bribes across Latin America and has already spent $3.5 billion for settlements in the United States, Brazil and Switzerland. 
Enriquez said it was unclear which U.S. federal department was holding Baldizon. 
The prosecutor's office carried out 10 raids on Saturday and arrested three people as part of the Odebrecht investigation, the statement added.
In 2016, the head of Guatemala's special anti-corruption prosecutor's office told Reuters he had already been investigating Odebrecht's bribes to a government official, and President Jimmy Morales said his administration would check all of the company's contracts. 
Guatemala has long struggled with political corruption.
In August, Morales came under fire for attempting to expel a United Nations-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala prosecutor seeking to put him on trial for alleged corruption.
The investigation into allegations of illicit campaign financing, which followed separate graft probes into members of the president's family, had threatened to condemn Morales to impeachment.

With powers to prepare crime and corruption cases, the commission was instrumental in removing former President Otto Perez Molina from office in 2015 after identifying him as a key player in an alleged multibillion-dollar graft scheme.

BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - As military deminers warily picked their way through streets wrecked by war in Benghazi, a loud blast rang out - a familiar sound in the Libyan city, areas of which are riddled with deadly explosives and booby traps.
On this occasion, it was a 27-year-old man returning to his home before it was declared safe to do so who had set off a mine. He died after both his legs were amputated in a vain attempt to save his life.
Mines planted during more than three years of war in Benghazi are taking a high toll on under-equipped deminers and residents trying to return to districts where protracted battles took place. 
Military engineers striving to clear the explosives lack mine detectors and are working with basic tools and their bare hands. Their task is painstaking and extremely dangerous: 50 have been killed and 60 wounded, according to a military source.
""We were commissioned to clear all the main roads and thoroughfares in the areas of Benghazi where there was fighting,"" said Tarek Farkash, one of the engineers on the demining expedition in Benghazi's Souq al-Hout neighborhood. 
""Some of the work has been completed and some has not, because of the circumstances and obstacles we face.""
The war in Benghazi erupted in 2014, when Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar began battling Islamists and other opponents, part of a broader conflict that spread in Libya after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi seven years ago. 
Haftar's Libyan National Army took a final holdout from its rivals in December, but demining can take months. Souq al-Hout came under the LNA's control early last summer and is still far from being cleared.
Despite warnings from the military and indications of mined areas scribbled on walls, some long-displaced residents impatient to rebuild their lives have gone home, with deadly consequences. 
Farkash said at least 49 civilians had been killed and 38 injured, with the real number higher as not all cases had been accounted for. 
Benghazi's Al Jalaa hospital has been dealing with such casualties since February 2016, when Haftar's forces broke a military deadlock, taking control of the residential district of Laithi. The youngest casualty brought to Al Jalaa was three years old and the oldest 75, a hospital official said.
On Thursday, two brothers were killed by a mine as they returned to their home in the city center. 
Souq al-Hout resident Mohamed al-Ruwayi, whose building had been cordoned off by the military because of the risk from mines, described how a university teacher had recently returned to visit her home with her husband and was killed by a mine as she walked back down the stairs. 

""Yesterday I was sitting in front of the family home just before noon and I heard two consecutive mine explosions,"" Ruwayi said. ""We didn't know the cause. It could have been animals entering one of the homes.""

1052,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Czech presidential election headed for tight run-off vote -poll,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech voters are equally split ahead of a presidential vote next weekend between an academic who promises a better relationship with the European Union and incumbent Milos Zeman, who has used his time in office to push closer ties with Russia and China.
A poll by Kantar TNS for Czech Television shows voters leaning 45.5 percent for Zeman and 45 percent for Jiri Drahos, who is a former head of the Academy of Sciences. 
In the poll, which had 1,522 respondents, some 9.5 percent were undecided or not answering. Drahos also had a slightly higher number of ""certain"" voters than Zeman.
The Jan. 26-27 second round echoes other elections in the past two years across the European Union as well as U.S. President Donald Trump's battle with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the White House in 2016.
The 73-year-old Zeman has courted the far right in rejecting migrants from Muslim countries while pursuing warmer relations with Russia and China and sniping at the press. He won the first election round with 38.6 percent of the vote.
Drahos, 68, finished second on 26.6 percent with support from liberal voters attracted by his policies favoring European Union integration. 
The vote is seen as a referendum on Zeman, who has been in office since 2013. Most candidates who lost in the first round of voting endorse Drahos, which helps him narrow the gap.
While Czech presidents have limited executive power in the country of 10.6 million they do appoint prime ministers and central bankers, represent the country abroad and can have a big influence in public opinion.
The election can impact who leads the next government. Prime Minister Andrej Babis is rushing to form a new cabinet before a new presidential term starts on March 8.
The billionaire businessman Babis, whose ANO party was a runaway winner in a parliamentary election last October, has struggled to get governing partners while he battles police allegations of EU subsidy fraud, which he denies.
Lawmakers stripped him of his immunity from prosecution on Friday, a few days Babis's minority cabinet lost a confidence vote. Other parties have shunned governing with Babis. 

Zeman has backed Babis - who in turn has endorsed Zeman in the election - although Drahos has advised Babis to step aside to help a new administration form and has said it would be unacceptable to have a prime minister who faces police charges.

The call came during a visit by the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region's Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani, the first such high-level trip to Iran since last year's Kurdish independence referendum which Iran strongly opposed.
The Kurdish referendum on Sept. 25, which produced an overwhelming ""yes"" for independence, angered Iraq's central government and neighbours Iran and Turkey, which have their own restive Kurdish minorities.
""President Rouhani stressed the historical and deep-rooted ties between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Kurds of Iraq, and said all efforts should be made to strengthen the close relations between the two nations of Iran and Iraq,"" the state news agency IRNA reported.
Analysts have said that Iran appeared to be the ultimate winner in the crisis triggered by the referendum. Tehran is widely believed to have backed Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in his offensive to recapture Kurdish held-areas, including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. 
Barzani earlier met Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, who voiced concern over continued cross-borders raids by Iranian Kurdish rebels from Iraq's Kurdish region. 
""We cannot tolerate that counter-revolutionary groups use Kurdish territory to assassinate our soldiers and citizens and return to the Kurdish region, and then take responsibility for these acts in official Kurdish media,"" IRNA quoted Shamkani as saying.
Barzani said: The ""expansion of ties and cooperation between Iran and the Kurdistan region will not be affected by its opponents' efforts, and we shall use all our power to prevent security threats against Iran,"" IRNA added.

Several armed Iranian Kurdish opposition groups operate from bases in Iraq’s remote mountainous north and launch sporadic raids into Iran.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan's King Abdullah voiced concern on Sunday over a decision by Washington to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, saying East Jerusalem had to be the capital of a future Palestinian state.
In remarks during talks with U.S. Vice Mike Pence in Amman, the king said the only solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was a two-state one.
""The U.S. decision on Jerusalem ...does not come as a result of a comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,"" the monarch told Pence at the start of the talks in the royal palace.
Jordan lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank to Israel during the Arab-Israeli war in 1967.
Pence was in Amman on the second leg of a three-country tour that concludes in Israel.
In comments delivered in Egypt, he said Washington would support a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians if the two sides agreed to it.
Last month's endorsement of Israel’s claim to Jerusalem as its capital by President Donald Trump drew universal condemnation from Arab leaders and widespread criticism elsewhere.
It also broke with decades of U.S. policy that the city’s status must be decided in negotiations with the Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.
Pence told the king that Washington was committed to preserving the status quo of holy sites in Jerusalem.
""We take no decision on boundaries and final status, those are subject to negotiation,"" he said. 
Pence's is the highest-level visit by a U.S. official to the region since Trump made his declaration on Jerusalem last month.
Jordanian officials fear Washington's move on Jerusalem had also wrecked chances of a resumption of Arab-Israeli peace talks which the monarch had sought to revive.
King Abdullah said the U.S. move on Jerusalem would fuel radicalism and inflame Muslim and Christian tensions.
King Abdullah’s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, making Amman sensitive to any changes of status of the disputed city.
""For us, Jerusalem is key to Muslims and Christians, as it is to Jews. It is key to peace in the region,"" he said.
Jordanian officials are further worried the move could trigger violence in the Palestinian territories and a spillover into Jordan, a country where many people are descendants of Palestinian refugees whose families left after the creation of Israel in 1948.

1055,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Scandal-hit Thai temple helps to stage mass Buddhist event in Myanmar,"MANDALAY, Myanmar (Reuters) - Thousands of Buddhist monks gathered in Myanmar's second largest city on Sunday for an event partly organized by a scandal-hit Thai temple whose abbot is wanted for questioning on money-laundering allegations.
The Dhammakaya temple's foundation helped organize the mass alms-giving for an estimated 20,000 monks on the runway of an abandoned airport in central Mandalay.
Thailand's largest and wealthiest temple, Dhammakaya has staged similar spectacles at its vast complex north of Bangkok, which police besieged last year in a fruitless search for its fugitive abbot.
The Mandalay event aimed to ""tighten the relationship between both Myanmar and Thailand (and) unite the Theravada monkhood"" in the region, according to a Dhammakaya Foundation press release.
Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka are predominantly Buddhist countries which follow the religion's Theravada branch.
In Mandalay, a center for Buddhist learning crowded with temples and monasteries, monks in burgundy or orange began filing barefoot into the old airport before dawn.
Almost all the monks at the ceremony were from Myanmar and there were also thousands of local lay people attending along with about 100 monks and other Buddhists from Thailand and Sri Lanka, according to Dhammakaya temple.
Mandalay is home to the monk Wirathu, the self-styled ""Buddhist bin Laden"" famous for his anti-Islamic sermons, but there was no sign that he attended the mass alms-giving.
""It's such a wonderful ceremony. I live in Mandalay, and it's never happened like this before,"" said Ven Ya Ma, 40, who led a group of about 30 monks from the city's Ma Soe Yein monastery.
Ven Ya Ma opposed the actions of the Thai police against the Dhammakaya temple, which he said was only promoting Buddhism worldwide.
""People are worried that Buddhism is in danger,"" he said.
In March, Thai police abandoned a three-week siege of the Dhammakaya temple's complex, which is nearly 10 times the area of the Vatican City and centers around a giant, UFO-shaped golden stupa.
Police wanted to question the abbot, Phra Dhammachayo, about alleged money-laundering and building violations, but gave up after protests by monks and meditating devotees. His whereabouts are unknown.
Dhammakaya claims millions of followers in Thailand and around the world, and in recent years has forged closer ties with Myanmar's Buddhists.
Wirathu is a leading light in Ma Ba Tha, a religious group accused of whipping up anti-Muslim sentiment in Myanmar.

A brutal military crackdown in Rakhine State, in western Myanmar, has driven about 650,000 Rohingya Muslims over the border into Bangladesh since August.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - European leaders will be out in force at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week to defend multilateralism before U.S. President Donald Trump arrives to deliver his ""America First"" message.
Politicians, business chiefs, bankers and celebrities will meet in the Swiss Alps under the banner ""Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World"" for the four-day gathering against an unsettling global backdrop.
A decade after the bankruptcy of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers helped trigger a global financial crisis, economic growth has returned and stock markets are hitting record highs.
Yet there is a nagging fear among many in Davos that the brighter economic outlook could turn out to be little more than a mirage if the daunting array of geopolitical threats - from protectionism and climate change to cyber attacks and outright war - gather pace in 2018.
""Not all geopolitical threats are threats to financial markets,"" Axel Weber, the chairman of Swiss bank UBS and former president of the German Bundesbank told Reuters. ""But I agree that there may be a disconnect, which has been going on for some time already and may well continue for some time.""
The Global Risks Report published by the WEF last week showed that many see a heightened risk of political and economic confrontations between major powers this year.
Trump, the first sitting U.S. president to attend the forum since Bill Clinton in 2000, is a source of much of this anxiety after a volatile first year in office in which he has turned American foreign policy on its head. 
The forum will open on Tuesday with a speech by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and end on Friday, when Trump is due to address the massive auditorium where Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke last year, offering to fill the global leadership void created by an inward-looking Washington.
White House officials said over the weekend that a government shutdown in the United States was unlikely to prevent Trump from making the trip, although the budget director Mick Mulvaney said it was now ""in flux"".
In the days between Modi and Trump, the leaders of Europe's biggest countries, absent from Davos last year and emboldened by their own economic recovery, will offer an alternative vision to Trump and Xi, who the Europeans say has failed to deliver on his promise of a year ago to open China up to foreign investment.
EUROPE'S NEW STAR 
The charge will be led by French President Emmanuel Macron, the new star of European politics, who in an audacious move, has invited many of the business leaders who will be in Davos to the Palace of Versailles on Monday to press them to invest in France.
When he speaks in Davos on Wednesday, the former investment banker will offer his own ""diagnosis"" of globalization and set out a vision for addressing widening inequalities, global warming and the rise of nationalism, his advisers say.
""I don't think Macron will be able to resist being the counter-Trump,"" said Robin Niblett, director of the Chatham House think tank in London.
Macron will be joined by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, returning to the world stage after months of political limbo at home, and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, back in Davos after a 20-year absence, is also due to speak.
The WEF is a marathon of panel discussions, lunches and cocktail parties that delve into subjects as diverse as terrorism, artificial intelligence and wellness.
This year's conference will include several sessions on sexual harassment, a nod to the #MeToo movement that erupted after allegations of sexual misconduct by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. 
Criticized in past years for not representing women, the WEF appointed seven female co-chairs this year, including Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Ginni Rometty, the CEO of  IBM  (NYSE:IBM).
Among the other leaders attending are British Prime Minister Theresa May, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and several African leaders, including Zimbabwe's new president Emmerson Mnangagwa.
Last year, the sole envoy from the Trump camp in the week leading up to his inauguration was Anthony Scaramucci, the New York financier who was sacked after just 10 days as White House communications director.
This year, Trump will be joined by a large U.S. delegation including Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.

For the first time in years, Iran will not be represented. WEF officials could not say whether the late cancellation by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif had anything to do with Trump's decision to speak.

1057,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Why is Jerusalem so central to Pence's Middle East visit?,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's planned trip to Israel on Sunday has been overshadowed by President Donald Trump's announcement last month that the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and will start the process of moving its embassy there.
Pence, an evangelical Christian, plans to meet Israeli leaders and to visit the Western Wall, the Israeli parliament and a Holocaust remembrance center in Jerusalem during the two-day visit, after stops in Egypt and Jordan. 
Pence, however, is not scheduled to meet any Palestinian leaders, who declined to see him.
The trip was originally planned for December but was postponed after protests from Arab political and religious leaders - Muslim and Christian – about Trump's Jerusalem decision, which broke with decades of U.S. policy and drew widespread criticism from America's allies.
WHY DID TRUMP RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM AS ISRAEL'S CAPITAL, AND ANNOUNCE THE EMBASSY WILL BE MOVED THERE?
There has long been pressure from pro-Israel politicians in Washington to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and Trump made it a promise of his 2016 election campaign.
Pence and David Friedman, the ambassador to Israel appointed by Trump, are thought to have pushed hard for both recognition and embassy relocation. It is a decision that was popular with many conservative and evangelical Christians who voted for Trump and Pence. Many of them support political recognition of Israel's claim to the city. 
WHY DOES JERUSALEM PLAY SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT?
Religion, politics and history. 
Jerusalem is a city that is sacred to Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and each religion has sites of great significance there. Jerusalem has been fought over for millennia by its inhabitants, and by regional powers and invaders including the Egyptians, Babylonians, Romans, early Muslim rulers, Crusaders, Ottomans, the British Empire, and by the modern states of Israel and its Arab neighbors.
Israel's government regards Jerusalem as the eternal and indivisible capital of the country, although that is not recognized internationally. Palestinians feel equally strongly, saying that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a future Palestinian state. The city even has different names. Jews call it Jerusalem, or Yerushalayim, and Arabs call it Al-Quds, which means ""The Holy"".
But the city’s significance goes further.
At the heart of Jerusalem’s Old City is the hill known to Jews across the world as Har ha-Bayit, or Temple Mount, and to Muslims internationally as al-Haram al-Sharif, or The Noble Sanctuary. It was home to the Jewish temples of antiquity but all that remains of them above ground is a restraining wall for the foundations built by Herod the Great. Known as the Western Wall, this is a sacred place of prayer for Jews.
Within yards of the wall, and overlooking it, are two Muslim holy places, the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which was built in the 8th century. Muslims regard the site as the third holiest in Islam, after Mecca and Medina. The city is also an important pilgrimage site for Christians, who revere it as the place where they believe that Jesus Christ preached, died and was resurrected.
WHAT IS THE CITY'S MODERN HISTORY AND STATUS?
In 1947, the United Nations General Assembly decided that the then British-ruled Palestine should be partitioned into an Arab state and a Jewish state. But it recognized that Jerusalem had special status and proposed international rule for the city, along with nearby Bethlehem, as a 'corpus separatum' to be administered by the United Nations. 
That never happened. When British rule ended in 1948, Jordanian forces occupied the Old City and Arab East Jerusalem. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally.
In 1980 the Israeli parliament passed a law declaring the ""complete and united"" city of Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel. But the United Nations regards East Jerusalem as occupied, and the city's status as disputed until resolved by negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. The King of Jordan retains a role in ensuring the upkeep of the Muslim holy places.
DOES ANY OTHER COUNTRY HAVE AN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM?
Other countries have had embassies in Jerusalem in the past, but moved them out of the city some years ago. In December Guatemala's president, Jimmy Morales, said that his country will move its embassy from Tel Aviv. Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said several countries were considering following the U.S. lead, but he declined to identify them. 
Also in December, 128 countries voted in a non-binding U.N. General Assembly resolution calling on the U.S. to drop its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Nine voted against, 35 abstained and 21 did not cast a vote.
WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN NEXT? HAS JERUSALEM BEEN A FLASHPOINT BEFORE?
The timeframe of the U.S. embassy move is unclear, with different predictions from Israeli and U.S. officials about how soon it could happen. Since the announcement there has been tension, with Palestinian protests in Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank. At least 18 Palestinians and one Israeli have been killed since Trump's Dec. 6 announcement. 
Although the clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces have not been on the scale of the first and second Palestinian intifadas in 1987-1993 and 2000-2005, violence has erupted before over matters of sovereignty and religion.
In 1969 an Australian Messianic Christian tried to burn down the Al-Aqsa Mosque. He failed, but caused damage. So charged was the Middle East's political climate - just two years after the Six Day War - that there was fury across the Arab world.
In 2000, the Israeli politician Ariel Sharon, then opposition leader, led a group of Israeli lawmakers onto the Temple Mount/al-Haram al-Sharif complex. Palestinians protested, and there were violent clashes that quickly escalated into the second Palestinian uprising, also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada.
Deadly confrontations also took place last July after Israel installed metal detectors at the entrance to the complex following the killing of two Israeli policemen there by Arab-Israeli gunmen.

Arab leaders across the Middle East have warned that a unilateral American move could lead to turmoil, and hamper U.S. efforts to restart long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Iraq's supreme court rules against election delay,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's Supreme Federal Court on Sunday ruled against calls by Sunni and Kurdish lawmakers to delay a parliamentary election, expected to be called for May, to allow hundreds of thousands of people displaced by war to return home.
Shi'ite politicians, including Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, argued delaying the election would be unconstitutional.
The election must be held ""within the timeframe provided by the constitution,"" the court said in a statement.
Parliament is expected to meet on Monday to validate May 12 as the date for the ballot, as suggested by the government, or agree another date in May. 
Abadi is seeking re-election, building on a surge in his popularity among Iraq's majority Shi'ite Arab community after leading the three-year fight against Islamic State militants, supported by a U.S.-led coalition. 
""Postponing the elections would set a dangerous precedent, undermining the constitution and damaging Iraq’s long-term democratic development,"" the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said in a statement on Thursday.
The United States had shown understanding for Abadi's move in October to dislodge Kurdish fighters from the oil rich northern region of Kirkuk, even though the Kurds are traditional allies of Washington and played a key part in the war against Islamic State militants. 
Tens of thousands of Kurds were displaced as a result of the takeover of the ethnically mixed areas of Kirkuk and its surroundings by Iraqi forces supported by Iranian-backed paramilitary groups. 
The United Nations estimates the total number of people who remain displaced in Iraq at 2.6 million, mostly Sunni Arabs from areas previously controlled by Islamic State.
The role of prime minister is reserved for the Shi'ite Arabs under a power-sharing system set up after the 2003 U.S-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Arab. 
The largely ceremonial office of president is reserved for a Kurdish member of parliament, while the speaker of parliament is drawn from among Sunni Arab MPs.

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",German SPD leader implores party to back coalition talks with Merkel,"By Holger Hansen and Paul Carrel
BONN (Reuters) - Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz made an impassioned appeal to his party on Sunday to give the go-ahead for formal coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, a move that would bring Germany a step closer to a stable government.
Schulz is facing a backlash from the Social Democrats' (SPD) left and youth wings, which argue the party should reinvent itself in opposition after scoring its worst election result in September since Germany became a federal republic in 1949.
Speaking in Bonn, where late SPD chancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt earned reputations as international statesmen while ruling former West Germany, Schulz implored delegates to allow the SPD to serve as Merkel's junior coalition partner again - a sign of how far the party's fortunes have fallen.
""The SPD must and will be visible, audible and recognizable!"" Schulz, sounding hoarse after a week of lobbying delegates, said to loud applause at the packed World Conference Center in the former capital city.
""We ask for your consent to start coalition negotiations.""
Around 600 delegates met at the special party congress in Bonn to debate and vote on whether their leaders should push ahead with formal coalition talks on renewing an alliance with Merkel's conservatives that took office in 2013.
The two blocs, which both bled support to the far right in the Sept. 24 election, struck a preliminary deal earlier this month after exploratory talks, but critics, including the party's youth wing leader Kevin Kuehnert, say the blueprint does not bear enough of the SPD's hallmarks.
BLUEPRINT
A copy of the motion on which delegates will vote, seen by Reuters, included language on SPD leaders reaching ""concrete, effective improvements"" to the blueprint but did not make a final vote on the coalition deal conditional on achieving these.
The envisaged improvements would see concessions on labor, health and migration policies, the motion showed.
""We will fight for further improvements in the coalition negotiations if we can continue the talks,"" Schulz said.
If a coalition deal is reached, all SPD members still get to vote on the agreement - another hurdle to achieving a new government in Europe's economic powerhouse, which is humming despite the political uncertainty.
Sunday's vote will be watched abroad as Germany has Europe's largest economy and Merkel has long played a leading role in the continent's economic and security affairs.
""Without the SPD, there will be no bold impulses for the future of Europe,"" said Schulz, 62, a former president of the European Parliament. ""It is up to us.""
Arriving for Sunday's congress, SPD parliamentary leader Andrea Nahles told Reuters she was ""cautiously optimistic"".
A negative vote by the SPD would prolong Germany's political deadlock - already four months old - just as its European partners are looking to Berlin for leadership on European Union reform in light of Britain's decision to leave the bloc.
Possible scenarios in case of an SPD rejection would include a new election or a minority government for what would be the first time in Germany's post-war era.
""This is about the question: coalition negotiations or new elections!"" Schulz said in a 57-minute speech. ""I do not believe new elections are the right way for us.""
Merkel has said she would prefer a new election to leading a minority government.
Leading conservatives have rejected SPD demands for more concessions. Business associations have urged SPD delegates to back coalition talks.

1060,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>",Congolese security forces kill three while dispersing anti-Kabila protest,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - At least three people were killed when Congolese security forces fired tear gas and live bullets to disperse a protest against President Joseph Kabila organized by the Catholic church on Sunday, a local watchdog said.
Seventeen other people were wounded, it said.
A Reuters witness saw police and paramilitary troops fire volleys of tear gas and shoot into the air outside the Notre Dame cathedral in the capital Kinshasa. At least six people were lightly wounded when they were struck with flying tear gas canisters, he said.
Anger has been building against Kabila since he refused to step down at the end of his mandate in December 2016, triggering street protests in which scores have been killed in Kinshasa, and emboldening a plethora of armed rebel groups upcountry. 
This has stoked fears that the vast, mineral-rich Democratic Republic of Congo could slide back into the wars that killed millions in the 1990s, mostly from hunger and disease.
""I marched today for a simple reason: I want to bring up my children in a country that respects human rights,"" protester Pascal Kabeya, a 40-year-old market trader, told Reuters where a few hundred had gathered in a suburb of Kinshasa. 
Georges Kapiamba, president of Congolese Association for Access to Justice (ACAJ) put the initial toll at three dead and 17 seriously wounded. A police spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The violence echoed that of New Year's Eve, when Congolese forces killed at least seven people in the capital during a protest by Catholic activists..
Under a deal mediated between the Catholic church and Kabila's opponents, the president was to step down at the end of last year, paving the way for an election early this year. But he reneged on the deal and the poll has been repeatedly delayed -- it is currently loosely scheduled for the end of 2018.
The Roman Catholic Church has since emerged as a harness for opposition to Kabila's efforts to stay in power with no mandate, while his political opposition remains feeble and fragmented.

Kabila, who has been president his father was killed in office in 2001, blames the electoral delays on the logistics of voter registration.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Six months into laying the groundwork for his presidential bid, Egyptian hopeful Mohamed Anwar Sadat hit a snag: he could not find a hotel prepared to hire him a space to launch his campaign.
""One said they were completely booked for a year ... another told us they got instructions from security agencies not to hold a conference for this person,"" said Osama Badie, his media coordinator for the campaign.
Printers refused to print Sadat's manifesto, Badie said. He declined to name the three major Cairo hotels that had turned down the campaign and did not identify five printing firms that had declined to do business with them.
Those challenging President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in an election to be held in March describe a sweeping effort to kill off their campaigns before they begin, with media attacks on candidates, intimidation of supporters, and a nomination process stacked in favor of the former general.
Egypt's electoral commission declined to immediately comment on opposition concerns. The government press office did not immediately respond to questions about the candidates' assertions when contacted by Reuters by telephone and in writing.
The electoral commission has pledged to run the vote ""according to principles of independence, transparency and objectivity"". 
Sisi announced late on Friday that he would run for a second term as president. The election is Egypt's third since the 2011 uprising that deposed President Hosni Mubarak.
Campaigning was allowed to begin from Jan. 20, but opposition organizers say their efforts to get their campaigns off the ground are being stifled.
Citing safety concerns for his campaign team, Sadat, 62, whose uncle, President Anwar Sadat, was assassinated in 1981, abruptly dropped out of the race this week. 
""It's a systematic campaign to kill off candidates. I call it a political assassination process,"" Badie told Reuters from Sadat's headquarters just after the withdrawal. 
Former prime minister and air force commander Ahmed Shafik, seen as the most serious potential challenger to Sisi, also pulled out this month, saying he had spent too much time out of the country and was out of touch with Egyptian politics.
Shafik returned to Egypt from the United Arab Emirates in December after announcing his intention to run, and was met by widespread criticism from state-aligned media.
The 76-year-old narrowly lost a presidential election to Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Mursi in 2012 before fleeing for the United Arab Emirates, where he had since lived.
""Even the limited margins of opposition and critique and freedoms that were allowed under Mubarak are not allowed right now. It's zero tolerance, 100 percent control,"" said Ashraf El Sherif, political science professor at the American University in Cairo, citing what he said was a crackdown on grassroots activists.
Formally announcing his own candidacy as expected on Saturday morning, former armed forces chief of staff General Sami Anan called on all civilian and military institutions to maintain neutrality in the election. 
'THE REAL FIGHT'
Sisi, a former military commander, won a landslide election victory in 2014, a year after he led the overthrow of Mursi, Egypt's first freely-elected president.
Sisi's potential challengers say the fiercest fight now is getting on the ballot.
Election regulations stipulate that would-be candidates must obtain the backing of at least 20 members of parliament or be supported by at least 25,000 eligible voters in at least 15 governorates through pledges of support submitted at notary offices.
Lawmakers have so far only provided nomination pledges for Sisi. His rivals have had to dash across the country to drum up pledges before the nomination window closes on Jan. 29.
Khaled Ali, a human rights lawyer and presidential hopeful, said the process of collecting pledges has been marred by fraud.
Ali's campaign organizers say payments are being made for Sisi pledges while their supporters face intimidation when they try to submit their own. The organizers say plainclothes security officers present at the notary offices were asking people if they supported Sisi. 
""The fight to gather nomination pledges is the real fight in these elections,"" Ali said on Wednesday. 
A Reuters reporter visiting three notary offices in Cairo witnessed about 10 Egyptian voters discussing when they would receive payments they had been promised in return for supporting Sisi and how much they would be paid. 
Ali's campaign organizers said payments were being made by companies and individuals supporting Sisi, but Reuters was unable to determine where the payments ultimately came from.
The campaign for Sami Anan told Reuters that many of their pledges were going unprocessed.
""The employees of these (notary) offices are saying that Anan's name is not listed on the system in the office and they need instructions on how to process his nomination pledges,"" said Sami Balah, the secretary general of a party nominating Anan.
Balah did not identify the notary offices. The electoral commission declined to comment on his assertion about the offices, whose employees are not authorized to speak to the media.

It will be the first big protest in Greece since the two countries agreed this month to renew efforts to settle the 25-year old dispute. Organizers said they expected tens of thousands of people to turn out on Sunday and more rallies are planned in northern Greece this week.
Macedonia's attempts to join NATO and the European Union have been blocked by Greece, which says the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim over its own northern region of that name, which includes the city of Thessaloniki.
Until the row is resolved, Athens has agreed that the country can be referred to internationally as ""FYROM"" (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), the name under which it was admitted to the United Nations in 1993.
Talks between the two countries' chief negotiators this week, mediated by United Nations' diplomat Matthew Nimetz, did not produce concrete results but some name suggestions were put forward for negotiation, according to local media.
""There is only one Macedonia and it is Greek,"" protesting groups said on videos uploaded on the internet. The main rally was due to begin at 1200 GMT.
Macedonia, which has a population of about 2 million, declared independence in 1991, avoiding the violence that accompanied much of the breakup of Yugoslavia. Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, who took power last May, pledged to accelerate the country's bid to join the EU and NATO and to work on resolving the name dispute.
Settling the issue would be hailed as a success by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose left-right coalition first came to power in January 2015. So far, the issue has strained relations with his coalition ally, the right-wing Independent Greeks party.
""It's totally groundless historically and absurd to seek the exclusivity of Macedonia,"" Tsipras told Sunday's Ethnos newspaper.
""But it is not unreasonable to have the term 'Macedonia' included in a compound name, with either a geographical or a chronological qualifier, for all uses, to make absolutely clear that nobody claims other people's land or history.""
A poll last week showed that a majority of Greeks do not want ""Macedonia"" used in any solution.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel will not prosecute a guard from its embassy in Amman who killed two Jordanians in July, as had long been demanded by the kingdom, two Israeli sources said on Sunday.
Instead, the Foreign Ministry and Shin Bet security agency will review protocols surrounding the actions taken by the guard, and his conduct, ""and share the results with the Jordanians"", a diplomatic source said.
The killings led to a rift between the countries, which both said last week had been mended.
Jordan said Israel had apologised for the embassy deaths, would compensate the victims' next of kin and ""implement and follow up legal measures"" in the case.
Jordanian officials were not immediately available to comment on the diplomatic source's account. Israel's Foreign Ministry spokesman declined comment.
Amman had previously demanded a homicide trial for the guard, whose repatriation under diplomatic immunity and hero's welcome by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu angered Jordanians.
Israel said in the aftermath of the incident that the guard had acted in self-defence, shooting a workman who stabbed and wounded him lightly, and that the second Jordanian was killed by stray fire.
Asked on Sunday whether criminal prosecution of the guard was possible, a second Israeli official told Reuters on condition of anonymity: ""No way.""
The guard's prospects of remaining in the Israeli secret service may be in doubt, however, after a Jordanian newspaper published his name and photograph.
Other fine-print elements of the reconciliation deal were designed to limit legal culpability for Israel, the diplomatic source said.
Israel would not pay damages to the next of kin directly, but instead provide a $5 million lump sum for the Jordanian government to disburse as compensation, that source said. The money is also meant to cover the needs of the family of a Jordanian shot dead by an Israeli border guard in 2014.
Two sources close to the families confirmed the payout sum.
The Israeli diplomatic source said the Netanyahu government had not apologised for the shooting of the alleged assailant but rather ""voiced regret"".
On Thursday, a Jordanian government spokesman said Israel had sent a memorandum stating its ""deep regrets and apologies"".
Yet Israel distinguishes between the two expressions of contrition, seeing in the latter a potential admission of guilt.
A deal reconciling Israel and Turkey over the killing of 10 pro-Palestinian Turks who tried to breach the Gaza blockade in 2010 included Israel voicing regret and paying $20 million into a Turkish fund that compensated the bereaved and injured.
In return, Ankara agreed not to seek the criminal prosecution of Israeli marines who raided the activists' ship.
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
Three years later, during Netanyahu's first term as prime minister, relations were strained when Israeli secret agents were caught spraying poison into the ear of Palestinian Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal on an Amman street.
The assassination team was repatriated in return for an antidote for Meshaal and the release of Hamas's spiritual leader, Ahmed Yassin, from an Israeli jail.
On Saturday night in a Twitter posting, Netanyahu expressed appreciation for behind-the-scenes efforts by U.S. envoys Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt to help end the crisis with Jordan.

GUNGDUM, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Tensions mounted on Sunday at refugee camps in Bangladesh holding hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims over an operation to send them back to Myanmar, from where they have fled following a military crackdown.
Dozens of refugees stood holding cloth banners opposing their transfer as United Nations Special Rapporteur Yanghee Lee visited camps along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border over the weekend. Some refugee leaders said Bangladesh military officials had threatened to seize their food ration cards if they did not return.
Under an agreement signed last week, Myanmar is set to receive Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh at two reception centers and a temporary camp near their common border starting on Tuesday and continuing over the next two years.
The refugees refuse to go back unless their safety can be guaranteed and Myanmars grant their demands to be given citizenship and inclusion in a list of recognized ethnic minorities. They are also asking that their homes, mosques and schools that were burned down or damaged in the military operation be rebuilt.
Over 655,500 Muslim Rohingya fled to Bangladesh after the Myanmar military cracked down in the northern part of Rakhine state in response to militant attacks on security forces on Aug. 25. The United Nations described the operation as ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, which Myanmar denies.
Rohingya elders told Reuters that Bangladeshi army officials have called or met them over the last two days, asking them to prepare lists of families from their camps for repatriation. Four of them said they were among more than 70 camp leaders – representing thousands of refugees – who met army officers at the Gungdum camp on Saturday.
""When we said we cannot provide the lists because people are not ready to return, they asked us to bring their WP cards,"" said Musa, a leader at the Gungdum camp, referring to relief cards provided by the UN's World Food Programme.
Rashedul Hasan, a spokesman for the Bangladesh army, said he was not aware of army men threatening to take away food cards.
Hundreds of refugees queue up at relief centers across the camps each morning to collect food using the cards. These centers are managed by the Bangladesh army.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has repeatedly said Rohingya returns need to be voluntary.
""UNHCR has not been part of discussions (on repatriation) to date, but has offered support to engage in the process to ensure that the voices of refugees are heard,"" Caroline Gluck, a senior protection officer for the agency, said by email on Saturday.

""The pace of returns should be determined by the refugees themselves.""

ONCUPINAR, Turkey (Reuters) - Turkey continued to fire artillery at a U.S.-backed Kurdish militia in northern Syria on Sunday, after Turkey's state media said four rockets from Syria had hit a Turkish border town.
The cross-border fire marked the second day of Turkey's new front in the nearly seven-year-old Syrian civil war. Under ""Operation Olive Branch"", Turkish airstrikes on Saturday pounded positions of the Syrian-Kurdish YPG militia in the northern Afrin province.
A Reuters reporter at the Oncupinar gate on the Turkish side of the border with Syria, could hear the boom of outgoing artillery, with one being fired roughly every three minutes.
Military convoys were traveling near the gate, with one transporter carrying several tanks.
""In its second day, #OliveBranchOperation continues to ensure peace and security for our people, protect Syria’s territorial integrity and eliminate all terrorist elements in the region,"" Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said on Twitter.
""Turkey expects its allies to support its fight against terrorism in all of its forms.""
Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency earlier reported that four rockets fired from Syria hit the border town of Kilis overnight, damaging houses.
Turkish security forces retaliated in kind, it said.
The operation pits Turkey against Kurdish fighters allied to the United States at a time when ties between Turkey and Washington - NATO allies and members of the coalition against Islamic State - appear dangerously close to a breaking point.
Saturday's strikes on the Syrian-Kurdish YPG militia hit some 108 targets, the Turkish military said. On land, the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army rebels were also helping the operation in Afrin, Turkish officials have said.
Turkey sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has carried out a deadly, three-decade insurgency in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast. 
The United States is backing the YPG in Syria, seeing it as an effective partner in the fight against Islamic State.

1072,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>","While political prisoners released, Myanmar's judicial reforms stall","By Thu Thu Aung and Simon Lewis
YANGON (Reuters) - Hundreds of political prisoners have been released from Myanmar's jails in amnesties in recent years, including dozens freed in January 2016, days before democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi’s party took power for the first time. 
Former President Barack Obama announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions in October 2016, citing the release of political prisoners and improved human rights as well as the elections that brought Suu Kyi to power. Suu Kyi herself had been under house arrest for 15 years before being released in 2010. 
Prison reform, however, has been put on the back burner under the new government.    
A new prison law was discussed in parliament in 2015, but was not passed. It has not been taken up since then by a new set of lawmakers - most of them from Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) - who took their seats in early 2016. 
The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a Myanmar group formed by former detainees, says prison reform should include repealing a law that gives police broad powers of arrest and pre-trial detention. 
The AAPP advocates overhauling vague or outdated rules in the Jail Manual and Penal Code, much of it written during British colonial rule. 
But the AAPP and rights groups caution that any new legislation on prison reform would not stop politically motivated prosecutions, which would need to be addressed with specific judicial and legal reforms.
Suu Kyi's government pardoned, released or dropped charges against hundreds of political prisoners in the month after it took office. But today, 46 people are serving prison sentences for political activities, and another 52 political prisoners are in jail awaiting trial, the AAPP says. 
       
OTHER PRIORITIES
NLD Party spokesman Aung Shin told Reuters prison reform was not yet on the legislative agenda because of other priorities.
""There are so many things to do as MPs, it may be a part of the reasons for not including prison reform in the parliament discussions,"" Aung Shin said.
He also said, however, prisons should be part of a broader examination of legal and judicial reform that the party and legislature was planning. He did not give a time frame for any contemplated legislation.  
AAPP says that 120 former political prisoners from the NLD party are members of the national parliament or regional assemblies. 
""There are so many former political prisoners in the NLD party, and even in the current parliament,"" said Aung Myo Kyaw, head of AAPP's Yangon office. ""It's sad they aren't considering this issue.""   
The military did not respond to requests for comment.
The home affairs ministry says it has improved prison conditions across the country. A ministry report in March said the Correctional Department had relaxed rules on family visits and improved education programs.          
    
RULE OF LAW
Many of the political prisoners, including some today, were jailed in Insein, a 19th-century prison in the north of Yangon that had a notorious reputation for torture, hunger strikes and rioting over inhumane conditions until Myanmar began transitioning to civilian rule in 2011. 
For decades, Insein prison, which has held politicians and poets alongside murderers, thieves and drug dealers, was emblematic of oppressive junta rule and Myanmar's poor record when it came to the rule of law.
Some prisoners were kept isolated or were physically and mentally abused while in jail, former inmates say. Amnesty International said misbehaving prisoners, including political prisoners on hunger strike, were still kept shackled in filth in kennels meant for dogs as recently as 2011. 
Suu Kyi herself was briefly held in a hut in the prison compound between spells of house arrest. Leaders of the NLD spent time there before Myanmar's military rulers started a transition to democracy in 2011 that brought both the release of hundreds of political prisoners and an improvement to prison conditions.
Insein is where Reuters journalists Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27 have been detained as they face an investigation into whether they breached Myanmar's Official Secrets Act after the two were detained on Dec. 12.  
Built during British colonial rule in the 19th century, Insein covers about 200,000 square meters - larger than New York's Grand Central station. 
By some accounts, conditions there have gotten a lot better.
Kyaw Zwa Naing, detained in Insein for two weeks in June after writing a satirical article mocking the military, said ""the prison officers treated us well"". 
""We could access food supply without limitation. No one threatened us,"" he said.
         
OVERCROWDED
After an inspection in March, the government-backed Myanmar National Human Rights Commission identified overcrowding as a problem and recommended building new dormitories.  
""The unlucky ones have to sleep right next to the toilet. In Myanmar, we can’t provide international standard cells for inmates,"" Commissioner Yu Lwin Aung told Reuters. 
Political prisoners and those accused of other non-violent offences are housed with inmates both accused and convicted of violent crimes, according to the AAPP, which regularly interviews recent inmates.
Family members say the Reuters reporters each have their own cell and sleep on mats on raised platforms. However, they say the two are fearful because they are being held in the same block as both suspected and convicted criminals.
Min Tun Soe, a deputy director and spokesperson for the Prison Department said overcrowding was no longer a concern - the prison now houses 12,000 inmates after increasing its capacity to 10,000.
""There's lots of reform going on in the prisons, such as new budgets for food supplies, healthcare and education opportunities for inmates, and also reforming the moral behavior of inmates,"" he said. 
""The situation is different than it was before,"" he said.

An investigation is ongoing into the crash of the AH-64 Apache helicopter on the sprawling National Training Center at Fort Irwin in southern California, Lieutenant Colonel Jason Brown, U.S. Army spokesman, said in a statement emailed to Reuters.
Another Army spokesman said that the pilot and the co-pilot were killed, but did not give their names, saying their families had yet to be notified.
The crew of soldiers and the aircraft were based in Fort Carson in Colorado and were on a training rotation at the base in the Mojave Desert, said Brandy Gill, a spokeswoman for the Army at Fort Carson.
The crash occurred about 1 a.m. local time, Gill said.
The AH-64 Apache is made by Boeing (NYSE:BA) in Arizona.
Boeing signed a $3.4 billion, five-year deal to make AH-64 Apache helicopters for the U.S. Army and an unnamed foreign customer, the company said in a statement last March.
Boeing's website shows that 2,200 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters have been sold globally since the U.S. Army took delivery of its first one in January 1984. Those helicopters have been delivered to Egypt, Greece, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Kuwait, the Netherlands, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and Britain, Boeing said.

1074,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2018 07:31PM ET</span>",Migrants stuck in Serbia want to move on,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - After traversing several countries en route to the rich West, Najibullah, a former policeman from the Afghan town of Kholm, his pregnant wife and four children, got stuck in Serbia.
Now they spend days of relative normalcy in a drab refugee camp in Krnjaca, an industrial area on the outskirts of the Serbian capital Belgrade, hoping they will ultimately move to Germany where 30-year-old Najibullah has relatives.
If they get their wish, they would join more than a million other migrants who have arrived in Germany since 2015, when Chancellor Angela Merkel offered sanctuary to those fleeing war and poverty.
Although lauded in some quarters, Merkel’s actions meant she paid a political price in German elections in 2017, where the far right surged on anti-migrant sentiment. In that light, the challenges of migration remains high on the agenda of western states, not least those gathering at Davos this month, under the banner of ""Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World"".
The path many took to Germany, the so-called 'Balkan route', was shut in 2016 when Turkey agreed to stem the flow of people in return for EU aid and a promise of visa-free travel for its own citizens.
But migrants from the Middle East, Africa and Asia continued to arrive in Serbia, mainly from Turkey, via neighboring Bulgaria, attempting to enter the EU through bloc members Hungary and Croatia.
According to officials there are as many as 4,500 migrants in government-operated camps in Serbia. Rights activists say that hundreds of others are scattered in the capital Belgrade and towns along Croatian and Hungarian borders.
In Krnjaca, Najibullah's eight-year-old daughter Sonya, started attending school and soon excelled in Serbian, enough to serve as an interpreter with her father in an interview on Tuesday.
""It is not bad here, I am going to school, I have good friends there, they invite me to parties ... my father wants to go to Germany, he has friends, sister there,"" Sonya said pointing to Najibullah.
Sonya is one of 95 children in the Krnjaca camp that are currently attending 11 elementary schools in Belgrade. Their numbers vary as while some families leave camps to enter Hungary and proceed further to Europe, others arrive.
Of the migrants that arrived in Germany, Europe's largest economy, since mid-2015, many have struggled to find their feet in the labor market due to a language barrier or vocational skills. Germany needs skilled labor, given its aging population.
Last October, Merkel agreed to cap the number of refugees the country accepts at 200,000 annually and Najibullah said he was hoping his family will be accepted.
""I hope I will find a job in Germany,"" Najibullah said according to Sonya's translation.
In another prefabricated hut, built by the communist Yugoslavia for single factory workers, Marwan Ahman, an ethnic Kurd from Iraqi city of Kirkuk complained about the bland, canned food served to his family of four in camp's kitchen.
Marwan, a civil engineer by education and a shopkeeper by trade also said he had no plans to stay in Serbia where living standards and wages lag far behind EU which it wants to join.
""I want to go to Germany to make good future to my children and my family,"" he said in Kurdish through an interpreter.

""Look at this room, it has bunk beds and nothing else, this is not good place for a family,"" he said.

1075,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2018 06:46PM ET</span>",Pence tells Egypt's Sisi that U.S. would back two-state solution,"By Jeff Mason
CAIRO (Reuters) - Vice President Mike Pence told Egypt's leader on Saturday the United States would support a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians if the two sides agreed to it, seeking to reassure a key Arab ally over President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Pence was in Egypt on the first leg of a three-country tour that includes stops in Jordan and Israel.
It is the highest-level visit by a U.S. official to the region since December, when Trump upended decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem in a move opposed by Arab leaders including Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
""We heard President al-Sisi out,"" Pence told reporters after their meeting, saying the Egyptian leader described his objection to Trump's decision as a ""disagreement between friends.""
Pence said he assured Sisi that the United States was committed to preserving the status quo of holy sites in Jerusalem and had come to no final resolution on boundaries for the two parties.
""My perception was that he was encouraged by that message,"" Pence said.
The Egyptian presidency said in a statement that Sisi noted that only negotiations based on a two-state solution could bring an end to the conflict, ""and Egypt would spare no effort to support this.""
Pence said he also pressed Sisi about two Americans who have been imprisoned in Egypt since 2013, as well as for reform of Egypt's restrictive laws on non-governmental organizations.
In his meeting with Egypt's president, Pence pledged firm U.S. backing in the nation's fight against Islamist militants and said ties between the two countries had never been stronger after a period of ""drifting apart.""
""We stand shoulder to shoulder with you in Egypt in the fight against terrorism,"" Pence told Sisi.
Egypt has faced security problems, including attacks by Islamic State militants in the North Sinai region. Trump has made the fight against Islamic State a top priority.
Though Pence intends to discuss counterterrorism issues throughout the trip, the Jerusalem decision remains a hot topic. Trump's announcement, which also set in motion the process of moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, prompted Palestinians to reject the United States as a peace broker.
From Cairo, Pence headed to Jordan, where he will meet with King Abdullah, a close U.S. ally. Abdullah warned against declaring Jerusalem as Israel's capital, saying it would have a dangerous impact on regional stability and obstruct U.S. efforts to resume peace talks.
Many people in Jordan are descendants of Palestinian refugees whose families left after the creation of Israel in 1948.
Pence will end his trip in Israel, where he will be warmly welcomed following Trump's designation. He plans to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, address the Israeli legislature and visit the Western Wall.
Pence is not scheduled to meet Palestinian leaders. They were incensed by Trump's decision on Jerusalem, which upended the longstanding U.S. position that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians must determine the city's status.
""The United States of America is deeply committed to restarting the peace process in the Middle East,"" Pence told reporters.
The Trump administration's announcement on Thursday that it was withholding about half the aid it was set to give a United Nations relief agency that serves the Palestinians raised questions about fledgling U.S. efforts to revive peace talks and further undermined Arabs' faith that the United States can act as an impartial arbitrator.

Pence also plans to visit U.S. troops while he is in the region.

Tunisia has been on high alert since 2015, when Islamic State gunmen killed dozens of foreign tourists in a museum in the capital, Tunis, and on a beach in the resort city of Sousse.
Algerian Bilel Kobi was ""the right arm of Abou Wadoud"" and was killed in an ambush near the Algerian border when on a mission to reorganize AQIM's Tunisian branch following strikes by Tunisian forces against it, the source told Reuters.
Last year Tunisian forces killed Islamist militants including Mourad Chaieb, the Algerian leader of Okba Ibn Nafaa, a group that has fought for years with security forces in Tunisia's mountainous interior.
The country also faces a potential threat from Tunisian militants returning from abroad. More than 3,000 are thought to have left to fight for jihadist groups in Syria, Iraq and Libya over the past years.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Romanians marched through heavy snow in Bucharest on Saturday in protest against corruption and attempts by the ruling Social Democrats to weaken judicial independence.
An estimated 50,000 people marched toward parliament from the iconic University Square, the site of all major protests since 1989, blowing whistles, waving flags and chanting ""Thieves!"", while thousands more demonstrated in cities across Romania. 
The Social Democrats (PSD) and their junior coalition partner ALDE used their majority to push a judicial overhaul through parliament in December, despite criticism from the European Commission, the U.S. State Department, thousands of magistrates and centrist President Klaus Iohannis.
Critics say the bills would weaken judicial independence and they have been challenged in the Constitutional Court where they await a ruling. 
""I came out today because I have two little boys and they deserve a better life in this European country,"" said Florentina Caval, 34. ""I honestly don’t think we will manage to overturn the judicial bills, but we need to try."" 
Lawmakers will also debate a new set of proposals to change the criminal code - including decriminalising some offences and lowering prison sentences - when parliament reconvenes in February. 
An earlier PSD attempt to decriminalize several corruption offences at the start of 2017 triggered Romania's largest street protests since the 1989 fall of Communism. 
""This is a last-ditch attempt before leaving the country. The year 2018 will be decisive,"" a 34-year-old real estate entrepreneur who traveled from the Transylvanian city of Sibiu to the capital of Bucharest said.
Later this month, the ruling coalition is expected to give its third prime minister in a year a vote of confidence following the resignation of former premier Mihai Tudose after falling out with powerful party leader Liviu Dragnea. 
Prime Minister designate Viorica Dancila’s cabinet will mostly be judged at home and by investors on whether it will hamper or facilitate the European Union state's struggle to stamp out high-level corruption.
Transparency International ranks Romania among the EU's most corrupt states, although Brussels, which has Romania's justice system under special monitoring, has praised magistrates for their efforts to curb graft.
Romania's anti-corruption prosecutors have sent 72 members of parliament for trial since 2006. The speakers of parliament’s lower house and senate are on trial in separate cases.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduran soldiers and police clashed with protesters blocking roads across the Central American country on Saturday, as discontent continues to fester nearly two months after a disputed presidential election. 
Security forces launched tear gas against rock-throwing supporters of the center-left Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship and tried to clear impromptu roadblocks of burning tires they had set across the capital Tegucigalpa and around the country, according to police sources and TV images.
Honduras, a poor, violent country that has long sent vulnerable migrants north to the United States, has been embroiled in a political crisis since the Nov. 26 election, which the opposition says was stolen by center-right President Juan Orlando Hernandez. At least 31 people have died in violent protests.
""Out with JOH, out with the dictator,"" masked protesters shouted in Tegucigalpa's Miraflores neighborhood. 
The Honduran electoral tribunal declared Hernandez, a staunch U.S. ally, the official winner of the election last month despite strident protests over the vote count. 
Initially, the vote tally had clearly favored center-left opposition candidate Salvador Nasralla, but it swung in favor of the incumbent after a 36-hour delay.
Hernandez is due to take office on Jan. 27.
""We have to stay in the streets,"" said former President Manuel Zelaya, who was ousted in a 2009 coup and is one of the opposition leaders. 

""If they move us from one spot, we have to move to another. We need to be permanently mobilized to keep up the pressure and prevent the dictator from installing himself.""

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2018 02:53PM ET</span>","Vowing anti-graft revolution, Mexican governor shakes election","By Frank Jack Daniel
CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (Reuters) - Invoking Pancho Villa's revolutionary legacy and armed with a hard-hitting corruption investigation into the country's ruling party, the governor of border state Chihuahua is shaking up Mexico's presidential election, without being in the race. 
Governor Javier Corral's national profile exploded in late December when his prosecutors arrested a senior figure in President Enrique Pena Nieto's party for his role in an alleged scheme to siphon $13 million of state funds for electoral campaigns. 
The election financing irregularities his government is probing in Chihuahua, where five people have been jailed for political corruption under his predecessor, should now be investigated in other states, Corral told Reuters in an interview on Friday.
""We want a true revolution in this country,"" the mustachioed governor said in his wood paneled office, hung with a large portrait of Villa, the legendary general of the Mexican revolution a century ago who lived and died in the state.
Villa put Chihuahua at the forefront of change in Mexico, something Corral said he wanted to repeat, this time with an unarmed revolution aimed at breaking what he called an ""impunity pact"" agreed by the political class that cuts across party lines and turns a blind eye to corrupt practices. 
On Saturday, Corral launched a two-week cross country protest caravan that will tour 1,124 miles (1,810 km) from Ciudad Juarez to Mexico City to keep attention on his cause.
A member of the opposition National Action Party, Corral says none of this is linked to the July 1 election. But his actions are widely seen as benefiting Ricardo Anaya, the party's candidate in coalition with a center party.
Corral said he wants Anaya to win, but would be happy with leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, or most other presidential hopefuls apart from the candidate of Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Jose Antonio Meade. 
""He represents everything we are fighting against,"" Corral said. 
Since Pena Nieto took office in 2012, corruption scandals, many in states ruled by the PRI, have repeatedly rocked the government. However, investigations have mostly tracked personal enrichment rather than how graft is used to finance politics.
""Really? It didn't favor the PRI in Veracruz, in Quintana Roo, in Nuevo Leon?"" said an incredulous Corral, listing states where former governors have been investigated for graft. 
When the federal government withheld some $36 million in federal financing to Chihuahua after the arrest of PRI operative Alejandro Gutierrez last month, Corral broke with Mexican political etiquette by vocally accusing Pena Nieto's administration of using the budget as a weapon to control unruly states.
""It's the carrot for those who behave themselves and the stick for those who behave badly,"" he said. 
The federal government says funds were cut to Chihuahua for budgetary and technical reasons, not as revenge, and Pena Nieto has criticized Corral for politicizing the matter. 
LONELY CRUSADE
So far, Corral's crusade has been lonely. While all the presidential candidates vow to crush corruption, several state governors, including some from his own party, have questioned Corral's claim that the federal government is bullying him.
However, as well as providing a sideshow to an otherwise unremarkable start to campaigning for the election, Corral's investigation into campaign financing could have consequences for the race itself if it claims more high profile scalps or spreads to other states.
There are already signs Corral's pressure on the government is having repercussions in his drive to bring his fugitive predecessor Cesar Duarte back to Mexico to face justice and pay back the $300 million dollars Corral says he stole.
Duarte denied accusations of wrongdoing before disappearing from public view. His whereabouts have been unclear since around the time his term finished in October 2016. 
This week, Meade sharpened his own rhetoric against corruption. Days later, and five months after Corral first sought his arrest, the office of Mexico's attorney general announced that it was seeking the extradition of Duarte from a unnamed country believed to be the United States. 
Corral welcomed that move, but said too much advance warning was given, maybe allowing Duarte to escape. He said his predecessor must be brought home to face justice. 

""We don't only want him to face the maximum sentence, more than anything we want him to pay back the damage he caused to the state's wealth,"" he said.

KABUL (Reuters) - A group of as many as four gunmen attacked the Intercontinental Hotel in the Afghan capital Kabul on Saturday night, seizing hostages and exchanging fire with security forces as the building caught fire and residents and staff fled.
Hotel manager Ahmad Haris Nayab, who managed to escape unhurt, said the attackers had managed to get inside and people were fleeing amid bursts of gunfire on all sides, but he had no information about any casualties.
Afghan interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish said details of the raid, which came days after a U.S. embassy warning of possible attacks on hotels in the capital, were unclear.
He said the attackers, who entered through a kitchen, appeared to have included suicide bombers.
According to one witness, who did not want to be quoted by name, the attackers took some hotel staff and guests hostage but there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the latest in a long series of attacks to hit Kabul.
The hotel, located on a hilltop and heavily protected like most public buildings in the city, was previously attacked by Taliban fighters in 2011.
It is one of Kabul's two main luxury hotels and had been due to host an information technology conference on Sunday. 
More than 100 IT managers and engineers were on site when the attack occurred, Ahmad Waheed, an official at the telecommunications ministry, said.
On Thursday, the U.S. embassy in Kabul issued a warning to U.S. citizens, saying ""We are aware of reports that extremist groups may be planning an attack against hotels in Kabul"".
Although the NATO-led Resolute Support mission says the Taliban has come under pressure after the United States increased assistance to Afghan security forces and stepped up air strikes against the insurgents, security remains precarious.
As pressure on the battlefield has increased, security officials have warned that the danger of attacks on high profile targets in Kabul and other cities would increase as insurgents sought to undermine confidence in security.
After repeated attacks in Kabul, notably an incident in May last year in which a truck bomber outside the German embassy killed at least 150 people, security has been further tightened in government and diplomatic areas.

While it shares the same name, the hotel in Kabul is not part of InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), which issued a statement in 2011 saying that ""the hotel Inter-continental in Kabul is not part of IHG and has not been since 1980"".

MORONI (Reuters) - Comoros has sold citizenship to nearly 52,000 foreigners since 2009, the government said in the first official statement on the scale of a passports-for-cash deal with Gulf states. 
Most of the documents had been sold under an approved scheme but there had been abuses that led to some Iranians buying passports, which had sparked tensions with Gulf allies, the country's foreign minister said. 
Comoros struck a deal with the United Arab Emirates in 2008 to sell economic citizenship to stateless Bidoon people living in the Gulf in exchange for cash for the poor Indian Ocean nation. However, the Comoros parliament is investigating complaints of corruption and procedures not being followed. 
The previously undisclosed tally for the number of passports sold means Comoros – a nation of some 800,000 people – should have received more than $260 million in revenues, a sum equivalent to over 40 percent of its gross domestic product.
However, Comoros investigators say large amounts of cash cannot be accounted for.
SALES ON HOLD
A Reuters report last month detailed how some passports had been sold to foreigners outside the original accord, including people alleged to have broken sanctions on Iran.
Comoros Interior Minister Mohamed Daoudou said the sale of further passports and renewal of existing documents held by foreigners were on hold pending the parliamentary inquiry and investigations into sales to people outside official agreements. 
The government says it has sought help from Interpol and U.S government investigators. 
U.S. and Interpol officials contacted by Reuters could not confirm whether an official request had been made.
Some Comoros and Western officials fear that the scheme was hijacked by people looking to bypass sanctions on Iran.
""The vast majority of people who secured passports (outside the official program) are of Iranian origin or are working for Iran,"" Foreign Minister Souef Mohamed El Amine said on Friday.
""This situation has created problems for Comoros with regard to our partners in the Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.""
Under former president Ahmed Abdallah Mohammed Sambi, who was in power from 2006-2011, Comoros had a close relationship with Tehran. However, Moroni cut ties with Iran in early 2016 and is now an ally of Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional rival.
Comoros recently canceled 170 passports that the government said had been improperly issued to foreigners, including many people born in Iran.

HASSA, Turkey/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Turkey opened a new front in Syria's war on Saturday, launching airstrikes against a U.S.-backed Kurdish militia in Afrin province that raise the prospect of worsening relations between Ankara and NATO ally Washington.
The operation, which the Turks dubbed ""Operation Olive Branch"", sees Ankara confronting Kurdish fighters allied to the United States at a time when ties between Turkey and Washington - both members of the coalition against Islamic State - appear dangerously close to a breaking point.
The attacks could also complicate Turkey's push to improve its relationship with Russia. Moscow will demand in the United Nations that Turkey halt the operation, RIA news reported, citing a member of the Russian parliament's security committee. 
The Syrian government condemned what it called Turkish aggression and said Afrin was an intrinsic part of Syrian land.
""We are carrying out this operation from land and air,"" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told broadcaster NTV. He said the attacks were being carried out to target the Syrian-Kurdish YPG militia and that no civilians had been hurt. 
""In a situation like this our expectations from everyone and especially from our allies is that they side with us, not with terrorists,"" he said, appearing to refer to Washington. 
Some 108 targets had been hit in airstrikes, the Turkish military said. A Turkey-backed rebel group in Syria, the Free Syrian Army, was also providing assistance to the operation in Afrin, a senior Turkish official said.
The YPG said the attacks left it with no choice but to fight back, saying Ankara had hit civilian neighborhoods and a number of people had been wounded. 
""We will defeat this aggression, like we have defeated other such assaults against our villages and cities,"" the YPG said.
Rojhat Roj, a YPG media official in Afrin, said warplanes pounded parts of Afrin city and villages around it, while there were skirmishes with Turkish forces and their rebel allies at the edge of Afrin. 
Hevi Mustafa, a top member of the civilian administration that governs Afrin, said people were holed up in shelters and homes and several wounded people had arrived in hospitals. 
Authorities in the Afrin region and war monitors say at least a million people live in the Afrin canton. Many of them are displaced from other areas. 
BORDER STRIKES
Reuters cameramen in Hassa, near the border with Syria, heard the sound of heavy bombardment and saw thick plumes of smoke rising from the Syrian side of the border. The warplanes appeared to be striking from the Turkish side of the border, one of the cameramen said.
The attacks follow weeks of warnings against the YPG in Syria from President Tayyip Erdogan and his ministers. Turkey considers the YPG to be an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has carried out a deadly, three-decade insurgency in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast.
Turkey has been particularly outraged by an announcement that the United States planned to train 30,000 personnel in a part of eastern Syria under the control of the YPG-spearheaded Syrian Democratic Forces.
Turkish officials have said the operation is likely to continue toward Manbij, further east. They also said that thousands of pro-Turkey civilians had escaped the YPG-controlled areas in an attempt to reach Aleppo.
However, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K-based monitoring organization said it was not true that people were fleeing en-masse.
GROWING STRENGTH
The YPG's growing strength across large parts of northern Syria has alarmed Ankara, which fears the creation of an independent Kurdish state on its southern border. Syrian Kurdish leaders say they seek autonomy as part of Syria, not secession.
The Turkish military said its Afrin operation was to provide safety for Turkey's border and to ""eliminate terrorists... and save friends and brothers, the people of the region, from their cruelty.""
""We will destroy the terror corridor gradually as we did in Jarabulus and Al-Bab operations, starting from the west,"" Turkey's Erdogan said, referring to previous operations in northern Syria designed to push out Islamic State and check the YPG's advance.
Earlier on Saturday, the military said it hit shelters and hideouts used by the YPG and other Kurdish fighters, saying Kurdish militants had fired on Turkish positions inside Turkey.
But the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces - which the YPG spearheads - accused Turkey on Saturday of using cross-border shelling as a false pretext to launch an offensive in Syria.
Differences over Syria policy have further complicated Turkey's already difficult relationship with NATO ally the United States. Washington has backed the YPG, seeing it as an effective partner in the fight against Islamic State.
A U.S. State Department official on Friday said military intervention by Turkey in Syria would undermine regional stability and would not help protect Turkey's border security.

Instead, the United States has called on Turkey to focus on the fight against Islamic State. Ankara accuses Washington of using one terrorist group to fight another in Syria.

Bulgaria, which currently holds the EU presidency, is preparing a meeting between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and EU leaders Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and Antonio Tajani in the Black Sea city of Varna, Prime Minister Boyko Borissov told reporters on Saturday.
""This meeting is a good chance to speak with the Turkish President on all issues,"" Chancellor Merkel told a joint news conference with Borissov in Sofia, adding ""we need orderly relations"" with Turkey to solve the problems.
Borissov said the meeting could address Turkish concerns over payments from the EU under the migrant deal, as well as souring relations between Ankara and some big European Union member states, mainly over human rights concerns.
EU accession talks with Turkey were frozen in December 2016.
On Friday, the Turkish minister for EU affairs said Ankara would reject any offer of partnership with the European Union that falls short of membership, warning that the current impasse gave Turkey no reason to maintain its migrant deal with the bloc.
He also said the EU was not honoring all parts of a deal to stem the flow of migrants westwards from Turkey in return for 3 billion euros ($3.67 billion) in financial aid to Turkey and other support.
""I think one meeting between us where we can discuss, move forward and create conditions (to see) if it would be decided at a later stage to host a bigger meeting,"" Borissov said. ""Such a meeting would be for the good of all of us.""
Speaking in Sofia last week, European Commission President Juncker said the EU and Turkey would see no progress in their relations as long as Turkey held journalists in prison. 
Authorities in Turkey have jailed more than 50,000 people and shut down some 130 media outlets in a major crackdown after a failed military coup in 2016.

TRUJILLO, Peru (Reuters) - Pope Francis, visiting an area of Peru that was devastated last year by heavy rains linked to climate change and plagued by gang violence, urged people not to lose hope.
On his penultimate day in Peru, Francis flew north to the this city near the Pacific Ocean to say Mass for about 200,000 people on the beach at the nearby oceanside town of Huanchaco.
""Peruvians today do not have the right to lose hope,"" he said in improvised comments in his homily to the vast crowd from his vantage point on a huge altar overlooking the Pacific.
Trujillo, capital of the region of La Libertad, was hit by major floods after six landslides in less than a week at the beginning of 2017, leaving tens of thousands of people homeless. The vast majority of people affected were poor.
The disaster was caused by the climatic phenomenon called Niño Costero, a warming of surface waters on the Pacific Ocean that generates intense rains on the coast of South America. Scientists have said climate change will make El Ninos more frequent and intense.
""You know the power of nature, you have experienced its force,"" Francis said. ""You had to face the brunt of the 'Niño Costero' whose painful consequences are still present in so many families, especially those who are not yet able to rebuild their homes"".
Apocalyptic scenes recorded on cellphones and shared on social media broadened the sense of chaos. Bridges collapsed as rivers breached their banks and cows and pigs turned up on beaches after being carried away by rivers.
Francis, who has often warned about the effects that climate change has on the poor, wrote a major document in 2015 on the need to protect the environment in which he backed scientists who say climate change is at least partially caused by the burning of fossil fuels.
Throughout Peru, an unusually brutal rainy season last year killed at least 162 people, slowed economic growth sharply and caused damage equivalent to 2 percent of Peru's gross domestic product. The cost of rebuilding damaged infrastructure was expected to be about $8 billion.
In his homily, Francis also mentioned increasing violence in the Trujillo area, where there have been hundreds of murders related to drug trafficking.
The pope said ""organized violence, like contract killings, and the insecurity they breed,"" insecure housing, and unemployment were the other ""storms"" the area had to bear.
Thousands of people spent the night on the beach in tents and sleeping bags waiting for the pope.

""You cannot imagine the enthusiasm we have for the pope, our faith is so great that it makes us forget the cold and fatigue in this vigil,"" said Roger Montañez, 56, who was wrapped in a blanket to protect from the ocean breeze.

The province in northwest Syria has become a focal point of the war, with government forces taking scores of villages in recent weeks. With the help of Iran-backed militias and Russian air power, they advanced towards Abu al-Duhur military airport, where rebels had ousted the army in 2015.
Since mid-December, fighting has forced more than 212,000 people to flee their homes in the south of Idlib and nearby parts of Hama and Aleppo provinces, the United Nations says. 
Ankara has warned the attacks will cause a new wave of migration, urging Russia and Iran to rein in the Syrian army offensive in Idlib, which borders Turkey.
Rebels have held Idlib since 2015, and its population has mushroomed with fighters and civilians escaping offensives in other parts of Syria. It has since become the largest single chunk of the country still under the control of factions fighting President Bashar al-Assad's state. 
Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by al-Qaeda's former Syria branch, is now the dominant insurgent force in the province.
In a broadcast from outside Abu al-Duhur airport, state TV said the military was searching the base for mines and battling insurgents around it.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said the army and allied militia took full control of the airport after heavy air strikes against the insurgents. 
The troops had stormed the base hours earlier, said a military media unit run by Lebanon's Hezbollah, which fights alongside the Damascus government. Other pro-government forces seized villages in rural Aleppo, it said. 
The army offensive has pushed into Idlib along several fronts from rural Hama to the south and from Aleppo province to the east. 
Government forces at opposite ends linked up on Saturday, splitting rebel territory in two, the Observatory and the Hezbollah media unit said. The advance besieged militants near the airport in an enclave, part of it under Tahrir al-Sham control and the other in the hands of Islamic State. 
In recent weeks, Tahrir al-Sham had been simultaneously under attack at the corner of Idlib from Islamic State, which has expanded a small pocket of territory in Hama since the army ousted it from central Syria last year.

Army spokesman Major Ronald Suscano said six soldiers were wounded in the encounter. 
The clash erupted after government forces encountered about 10 members of the Maute group in a district in Lanao del Sur, a stronghold of the rebel group, which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State, Suscano said in a statement.
The military in October declared victory over the Maute group, which seized control in the southern city of Marawi on May 23, after killing the remaining militants, including a few foreign fighters.
More than 1,100 people, including 165 soldiers, died in the five-month conflict.
The siege of Marawi, the country's biggest security crisis in years, has stoked wider concerns that Islamic State loyalists have learned how to thrive in impoverished Muslim areas of the island of Mindanao and use its jungles and mountains as staging posts to launch attacks.

Temer told newspaper Folha de S.Paulo that approval of the proposal, which raises the retirement age, remained a key target for his administration, even though analysts and politicians say it would be nearly impossible to pass such a bill in an election year.
""I want to say that the possibility to approve the reform is very strong,"" Temer said. 
""Several congressmen have changed their views,"" and the bill is slowly gaining more support, he added.
The pension proposal is seen as critical to reduce Brazil's large fiscal deficit and guarantee that the government will have resources to pay a growing number of beneficiaries in a country that is getting older.
Temer said his administration ""will not end"" if the bill fails to pass, since it has other priorities, such as a plan to simplify the tax system.
LULA
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has been convicted with corruption, is leading the polls in this year's presidential election. 
With a new trial for the former president only days away, 
Temer, who is not running, said he would prefer to see Lula losing in the election than in a court of law.
Temer was once an ally of Lula's Workers Party, but they split during the impeachment process that ousted Dilma Rousseff from the presidency. 
""We have to admit that if (Lula) were to be politically defeated, it would be better than being beaten (in a court), because he would be victimized,"" Temer said. ""Victimization is not good for a country and not good for a former president."" 
Lula could lose the right to run if his appeal of the corruption conviction is denied in next week's trial. He could leave the trial arrested.

1090,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2018 10:12AM ET</span>",German SPD leaders upbeat as biggest branch backs coalition talks,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Senior members of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) said on Saturday they were confident the party would approve the start of formal coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives at a special congress this weekend.
The upbeat comments came after the SPD's biggest regional branch in North Rhine-Westphalia recommended its members vote in favor of entering negotiations, on condition that party leader Martin Schulz push for more concessions on labor, health and migration policies.
Around 600 SPD delegates vote on Sunday on whether their leaders should push ahead with coalition talks on renewing an alliance with the conservatives that has governed Germany since 2013.
The two groups struck a preliminary deal last week but Schulz is facing a strong backlash from the SPD's left and youth wings, which argue that that blueprint does not bear enough of the party's hallmarks.
They say the SPD would be better off in opposition after scoring its worst election result since Germany became a federal republic in 1949.
SPD parliamentary leader Andrea Nahles said she still expected formal talks to happen.
""I expect a majority to back coalition negotiations,"" Nahles told Welt am Sonntag newspaper. ""Nevertheless, I ask everyone in my party to take responsibility: Please consider the consequences if this government option fails.""
Speaking to reporters in Sofia, Merkel said she hoped the SPD would approve the start of formal coalition talks.
""We will wait for the SPD party congress and then hopefully start coalition talks,"" Merkel said.
ROOM FOR MANEUVER?
A negative vote by the SPD on Sunday would prolong political deadlock in Europe's largest economy, which has been without a government since the Sept. 24 election that weakened both blocs. 
Possible scenarios then would include new elections or a minority government for what would be the first time in Germany's post-war era.
SPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil told regional newspaper Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung he expected the delegates to approve the start of coalition talks.
""The SPD knows very well what it wants, what it does not want and what is good for the people in the country,"" he said.
Michael Groschek, leader of the SPD's biggest regional branch in NRW, said he also expected a positive outcome, though the final coalition deal would ""for certain"" have to look different from the blueprint.
The SPD branch in that region wants a final coalition agreement to include a call to abolish Germany's dual public-private health insurance system in favor of a single citizen's insurance, to scale back temporary employment contracts and to allow family reunions for asylum seekers suffering unusual hardship.
Merkel's conservatives and leading business associations have urged the SPD delegates to back coalition talks, saying a rejection could plunge the country into a severe political crisis.
But Thomas Strobl, party deputy of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), rejected the SPD's latest demands for more policy changes to be included in the final coalition deal. 

""We'll still be talking about details - but basic things that are not already in the blueprint won't be added during coalition negotiations,"" Strobl told Funke media group.

The report cited diplomats in Brussels as saying that Germany was pushing for new sanctions together with Britain and France to show the United States that European allies were taking Trump's criticism against Iran seriously.
A German foreign ministry spokeswoman and another government spokesman both declined to comment on the report.
Germany wants to punish Iran for its missile program and its meddling in conflicts in other Middle East countries, such as the war in Yemen and Syria, the report said.
Above all, the aim of the Europeans is to prevent the United States from terminating the nuclear agreement sealed in 2015, as repeatedly threatened by Trump, Der Spiegel reported.
Iran said last week it would retaliate against new sanctions imposed by Washington after Trump set an ultimatum to fix ""disastrous flaws"" in a deal curbing Tehran's nuclear program.

Trump has said he would waive nuclear sanctions on Iran for the last time to give the United States and European allies a final chance to amend the pact. Washington also imposed sanctions on the head of Iran's judiciary and others.

KADUNA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Two Americans and two Canadians have been freed after being kidnapped in the northern Nigerian state of Kaduna, a police spokesman said on Saturday, as it emerged that five oil workers had been abducted in the southern Niger Delta region. 
The Americans and Canadians were ambushed by unknown gunmen on Wednesday while traveling from the town of Kafanchan in Kaduna state to the capital, Abuja. Kafanchan is more than three hours' drive northeast of Abuja.
In a separate incident, police in the Delta state said five Nigerian oil workers from local firm Sahara Energy were kidnapped on Thursday. Delta state police said no arrests had been made.
Kidnapping, usually for ransom, is common in parts of Nigeria, though abductors usually target other Nigerians. However, the kidnapping of foreigners is not uncommon.

""It was the efforts of the police, through the directive of the inspector general of police, that yielded their release last night,"" he said. Aliyu said no ransom was paid.

1095,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2018 09:19AM ET</span>",Iraqi PM meets Kurdistan region leader for first time since independence vote,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi met on Saturday with the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region's Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani for the first time since conflict broke out over a Kurdish independence referendum, officials said.
The Kurdish referendum on Sept. 25, which produced an overwhelming 'yes' for independence, angered Baghdad and Iraq's neighbors Turkey and Iran, which have their own restive Kurdish minorities, and brought a rebuke from the United States and European Union, the Iraqi Kurds' Western supporters.
At the meeting, Abadi renewed his conditions for lifting restrictions imposed on the Kurdistan region after the referendum, including a direct international air travel ban.
He said the Kurdistan Regional Government's (KRG) airports and border crossings have to come under the control of the federal authorities, according to a statement from his office.
Abadi also demanded that the Kurds stop exporting crude oil from the KRG independently from the central government. 
""Kurdistan delegation headed by @PMBarzani is in Baghdad now, met with @HaiderAlAbadi,"" Hemin Hawrami, a senior official of Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party said on Twitter.
""Later today the delegation will fly to Tehran for official meetings with senior Iranian officials Sunday,"" added Hawrami, who is also an assistant of ex-KRG president Massoud Barzani.
Iraq's central government said ""an atmosphere of trust"" marked talks held on Monday with the KRG to resolve their conflict, which saw armed clashes in October.
Under Abadi's orders, government forces responded to the referendum by dislodging Kurdish militia from disputed regions including the oil city of Kirkuk. 
Abadi also retaliated with a series of measures curtailing the KRG's autonomy, including a ban on direct international travel to the two main Kurdish airports.
A TV channel close to the KRG, Rudaw, said on Monday Iraqi and Kurdish negotiators agreed on a series of points to jointly manage the airports of Erbil and Sulaimaniya.
The KRG would accept that representatives of the Iraqi civil aviation authority would be posted in the two airports to oversee the implementation of federal regulations, it said.

Flights to evacuate or repatriate foreign migrants from Tripoli, which are mainly operated by U.N. agencies, were suspended because of Mitiga's closure. 
Tripoli has frequently been shaken by clashes between armed groups since Libya slid into chaos and violence following the overthrow of Mummar Gaddafi in 2011. Under the GNA, several large groups have expanded their power and the situation remains fragile.
Tripoli's main international airport was badly damaged by fighting in 2014 and is still out of service.

1097,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2018 07:59AM ET</span>",South Africa's ANC to force Zuma to quit as president: eNCA TV,"By Nqobile Dludla
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) declined on Saturday to comment on a report its executive planned to force Jacob Zuma to quit as president, as its leaders gather to outline the party's program for the coming year.
Broadcaster eNCA said the ANC's National Executive Committee (NEC) had resolved the previous day to ask Zuma - whose presidency has been tainted by a series of corruption allegations - to resign.
If he refused, he would be forced to step down by the party's six-strong leadership group, the channel said, without naming its sources. 
An anonymous member of the newly-elected NEC - which met for the first time under new ANC leader Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday and Friday - was quoted by online news site News24 as saying the decision to force Zuma to resign had been unanimous. 
eNCA also said authorities would within 24 hours name a new head of troubled power utility Eskom, which has been at the heart of allegations of illegality and undue influence in awarding tenders to the Gupta family, friends of Zuma.
Zuma, whose second term is due to run until 2019, has denied any wrongdoing, as have the Guptas.
The NEC made no mention of Zuma's possible early exit in a statement it issued after the first two days of what is a four-day meeting.
Asked about the reports that Zuma would be asked to resign, an ANC spokeswoman said: ""We can't confirm rumors of things that we don't know. The NEC has issued a statement on the totality of discussions yesterday.""
DIVIDED PARTY
Zuma retains the support of one part of the ANC leadership, but many others in the party argue that he has tarnished the image of Africa's oldest liberation movement. While he has been in office, the economy has also slowed to a near-standstill.
Ramaphosa succeeded Zuma as ANC head last month, making him likely to replace Zuma as the country's next president.
The party's Secretary-General Ace Magashule said on Thursday that Zuma's early removal as head of state was not on the agenda of the NEC meeting, which runs until Sunday.
But in recent days Ramaphosa has gone on the offensive against companies controlled by the Gupta family, businessmen friends of Zuma accused of unduly using political connections to win work with the state. They deny all wrongdoing.
That has fueled speculation the new ANC leader and his allies are moving to lobby support for Zuma's removal.
The South African edition of news website Huffington Post said Ramaphosa had been contacted by Eskom managers asking him to intervene over the running of the company. 
Eskom [ESCJ.UL], which supplies virtually all of the power for Africa's most advanced economy, has been embroiled in governance and graft crises and has delayed its interim results, a move that could see trading of its debt suspended in Johannesburg.
Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Thursday the Treasury could not afford to bail the firm out but would take action soon to tackle its difficulties.
Its executive chairman Zethemba Khoza told News24 on Saturday he had submitted his resignation to the government.
eNCA said his replacement would be named within 24 hours, with former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene the front-runner.
A spokeswoman for the utility said senior managers had met on Friday to discuss governance issues, adding she could not comment on any board changes, which were the responsibility of the Public Enterprises Ministry.
The ministry was not immediately available for comment. 
In its statement following the first half of the NEC meeting, the committee said officials led by Ramaphosa ""will continue their engagement with President Jacob Zuma to ensure effective coordination between the ANC and government.""
The main agenda item for the second part of the meeting, which will run until Sunday, is the party's program for the coming year.
Markets have rallied since Ramaphosa's election as ANC leader in December, as investors have warmed to his promises to root out corruption and kick-start economic growth.
Any sign that Zuma could step down before his second presidential term ends in 2019 has tended to lift South African assets, including the rand currency .

Shi'ite politicians, including Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, insist on holding the election as planned on May 12, saying a delay would be against the constitution.
Speaking after Saturday's session in Baghdad, Parliamentary Speaker Salim al-Jabouri, a Sunni, expressed hope that parliament would be able to vote on an election date by Monday, state TV reported.
Abadi is seeking re-election, building on a surge in his popularity among Iraq's majority Shi'ite Arab community after leading the three-year fight against Islamic State militants, supported by a U.S.-led coalition. 
""Postponing the elections would set a dangerous precedent, undermining the constitution and damaging Iraq’s long-term democratic development,"" the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said in a statement on Thursday.
Washington had shown understanding for Abadi's move in October to dislodge Kurdish fighters from the oil rich northern region of Kirkuk, even though the Kurds are traditional allies of the United States. 
Tens of thousands of Kurds were displaced as a result of the takeover of the ethnically mixed areas of Kirkuk and its surroundings by Iraqi forces supported by Iranian-backed paramilitary groups. 
The United Nations estimates the total number of people who remain displaced in Iraq at 2.6 million, mostly Sunni Arabs from areas previously controlled by Islamic State.
The role of prime minister is reserved for the Shi'ite Arabs under a power-sharing system set up after the 2003 U.S-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Arab. 

The largely ceremonial office of president is reserved for a Kurdish member of parliament, while the speaker of parliament is drawn from among Sunni Arab MPs.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia's detained opposition leader Kem Sokha has declined to join a new movement, founded by prominent exiles following a ban on the main opposition party, his lawyer said on Saturday.
The Cambodia National Rescue Movement (CNRM) was announced on Jan. 13 by Prime Minister Hun Sen's veteran foe Sam Rainsy following the dissolution of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) last year and the arrest of its leader, Kem Sokha.
Signs of division emerged among CNRP members over the CNRM, of which Sam Rainsy said could launch appeals to the people to organize peaceful protests, to workers to go on strike and to the armed forces to join them.
Kem Sokha's lawyer Pheng Heng said on Saturday that the opposition leader had declined to join the CNRM, saying that he will continue to work under the CNRP.
""He said that he doesn't join or support any movement and he's still with the CNRP, of which more than three million people had voted for it in recent elections,"" Pheng Heng told Reuters, quoting Kem Sokha when he visited him in prison on Friday.
Kem Sokha's daughter Kem Monovithya said that it's important not to get distracted from the CNRP. 
""I continue to do what I have been doing under CNRP framework, in consultation with the imprisoned leader Kem Sokha, to advocate for free and fair elections in Cambodia,"" Kem Monovithya said.
Sam Rainsy, who has lived in France since 2015 to avoid a series of convictions, didn't respond to Reuters request for comment. 
The CNRP was dissolved after the arrest of Kem Sokha, who was accused of plotting to take power with American help - charges he says were politically motivated because the threat the party posed to Hun Sen at this year's election.
The dissolution of the party and arrest of Kem Sokha have been condemned by Western aid donors who have said the election cannot now be credible. Hun Sen, 65, is expected to win easily.
The CNRP was set up in 2012 to unify Sam Rainsy's and Kem Sokha's separate parties. Its success in a 2013 general election and local elections last year had shown what a powerful electoral force it had become.

The United States has criticized China for constructing islands and military installations in the region, saying they could be used to restrict free nautical movement. U.S. vessels have conducted a series of ""freedom of navigation"" patrols in the region.
China ""firmly opposes"" efforts to use freedom of navigation as an excuse to hurt its sovereignty and urges the United States to ""correct its mistakes"", Lu said.
In a separate statement on Saturday, China's defense ministry said the repeated dispatch of U.S. warships to the region was ""undermining regional peace and stability"" and hurting bilateral relations.

""It's not a permanent cancellation on sending its advance team for performance, it is a tentative cancel,"" a ministry official said. 
A seven-member North Korean team had been scheduled to visit on Saturday to check venues for the performances, the Unification Ministry previously said. 
It was unclear whether the cancellation cast any doubt over the preparations for the North's participation in next months Winter Olympics in South Korea's Pyeongchang, an apparent diplomatic breakthrough after months of high tension over the North's nuclear and missile program. 
North Korea has still not disclosed the reason as to why it is not sending the advance team, the official said on Saturday. 
However, North Korea and South Korea will still discuss matters concerning next month's Pyeongchang Winter Olympics via the hotline between the two Koreas throughout the weekend, and the issue of the delegation's sudden change in schedule could be discussed, the official added. 
Meanwhile, North Korea called the United Nations' (UN) Secretary General's remarks this week on its nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches ""biased"" for not taking the United States to task on its own nuclear program, and attacked the United States and other nations for calling North Korea's nuclear program ""violations of resolutions"".

North Korea said the remarks it took issue with were in the vein of ""the U.S. desperately trying to reverse the trend of detente and improvement of inter-Korean relations, which is hardly achieved now"", seemingly referring to the apparent diplomatic breakthrough surrounding the Winter Olympics, according to a statement from the Permanent Mission of the DPRK to the United Nations.

Thailand has been ruled by the military since 2014. Demonstrations have since become a rarity, partly because of junta orders banning public assembly.
The United Nations has expressed concern over what it calls a deteriorating rights situation in Thailand, including harsh sentences for those convicted of violating the lese-majeste law, known as Article 112, as well as other restrictions placed on freedom of expression.
""We want to tell the junta that you have taken Thailand back a long way. The people in the agriculture ministry are all generals. There are just generals!"" said one protest leader.
""Let's hold hands! We are friends!"" he said, appealing to around 200 protestors gathered at the Thammasat University in Rangsit, north of Bangkok.
The demonstration, which was broadcast live on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), was shared more than 900 times and viewed by more than 32,000 times.
Sharing social media content deemed critical of the junta or royal family can land a person in jail in Thailand under its computer crimes act.
Those who joined the protest include members from various Thai civil rights groups including alternative farming, anti-mining and healthcare networks.
Around 200 police blocked a main door of the university to prevent protestors from leaving, according to police.
""This walk is a friendship walk. Over the past four years under the coup government we have no rights in terms of speech, action. We want the junta to hear us,"" Sangsiri Teemanka, a leader of People's Network for Welfare, told Reuters.
She added that protestors would stay put at the university until they were allowed to march.

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>","Cuba, U.S. hold talks on law enforcement despite tensions","HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban and U.S. officials concluded on Friday a week of talks on law enforcement cooperation in Washington with a meeting on the combat against illicit drug trafficking, at a time of heightened tensions between the old Cold War foes.
The talks show the countries continue to cooperate in some areas despite Republican U.S. President Donald Trump having a tougher stance on the Communist-run island than his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, as well as an ongoing crisis over alleged health attacks on U.S. diplomats in Havana.
""The meeting took place in an ambiance of respect and professionalism,"" the Cuban foreign ministry said in a statement. ""Both parties shared the view on the usefulness of the meeting and agreed to maintain the talks in the future.""
This was the fourth technical exchange on the fight against drug trafficking since Cuban and U.S. authorities established the law enforcement dialogue framework in November 2015.
Over the past week, Cuban and U.S. officials have also held talks in Washington on cybersecurity and preventing terrorism, according to the Cuban foreign ministry.
Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro declared a historic detente after five decades of hostility on Dec. 17 2014.
The two countries opened embassies, restored commercial flights and negotiated agreements on issues including the environment, law enforcement, the postal service and communications.
Those measures remain in place, although Trump last June announced a partial rollback of the detente, ordering tighter trade and travel restrictions. 
His administration in September also slashed staffing at the U.S. embassy in Havana over what it says is a mysterious spate of illnesses in two dozen of its diplomats and their relatives.

1109,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Mexico ruling party hopeful proposes graft law to boost election campaign,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Struggling to kick-start his campaign and clean up the image of the graft-stained ruling party he hopes to lead to election victory, Mexican presidential hopeful Jose Antonio Meade on Friday proposed tougher anti-corruption legislation.
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) contender Meade, a longtime public servant with a reputation for decency, is polling in third place ahead of the July election, weighed down by the PRI's record on corruption.
At an event in the Caribbean tourist resort of Cancun, Meade said his coalition would present a bill to impose tougher sentences on officials found guilty of corruption.
Under the initiative, the burden of proof would fall on officials suspected of corruption to show that their wealth was legitimate, or risk losing their assets, including properties registered in other people's names, Meade said.
""The mechanism is simple: whoever cannot explain the origin of their assets will forfeit them to the state,"" he said, according to a campaign statement. 
The credibility of the PRI, which dominated Mexican politics for most of the past century, has been undermined by graft, and the fight against corruption promises to be a major issue on the campaign trail.
Several former PRI state governors are in custody facing charges ranging from embezzlement to drug trafficking and earlier on Friday the attorney general's office said it had issued extradition requests for another PRI ex-governor.
In 2014, President Enrique Pena Nieto, his wife and a top aide all faced allegations of conflicts of interest over properties they acquired from government contractors, though a government-led probe exonerated them of wrongdoing.
Meade told supporters ""the fight against corruption cannot wait,"" and urged his rivals to support his initiative.
A former finance minister, Meade faces a delicate balancing act of persuading undecided voters he will cut out graft without alienating the PRI base he needs to win.
Meade's nomination for the PRI ticket is not guaranteed, and rumors of discontent over his campaign have swirled in recent weeks, encouraging some speculation he may be ditched before the PRI formally elects its candidate on Feb. 18.
Presidential front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist, has long railed against corruption. An opinion poll this week showed Meade losing ground to Lopez Obrador.

Meade delivered his remarks in the state of Quintana Roo, which was governed until 2016 by the PRI's Roberto Borge. Earlier this month, Borge was extradited from Panama to Mexico to face corruption charges. Borge denies the charges.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Friday he will run for a second term in office in an election in March, which the former military commander is widely expected to win.
Sisi's rule has brought some stability to the country, but critics say his popularity has been eroded by tough economic reforms that have hit people's livelihood's hard and by a crackdown on dissidents.
His supporters on the other hand say measures are needed to keep the country stable as it faces security challenges including attacks by Islamic State militants in the North Sinai region.
""Today ... I tell you frankly and transparently that I hope you would allow and accept my candidacy for the president's post,"" Sisi told a cheering crowd.
The vote will be held on March 26-28, with a run-off vote on April 24-26 if no candidate wins more than 50 percent in the first round. Candidates will register from Jan. 20 to 29.
In the televised announcement, Sisi listed Egypt's achievements during his first term, including a nascent financial recovery after years of political turmoil and economic instability.
""Building the state takes 16 to 20 years, I am trying to finish it in 8 years, God willing,"" Sisi said.
Sisi came to prominence when he led the army's ouster of President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013 - Egypt's first freely elected leader - two years after the downfall of longtime ruler President Hosni Mubarak in the ""Arab Spring"" uprisings that swept the Middle East.
The former general became president himself in 2014, winning 96.91 percent of the vote, although turnout was only about 47 percent of the 54 million voters, after voting was extended for a day.
Sisi's critics say his popularity has been hurt by austerity reforms, security problems, a crackdown on dissidents and his decision to hand two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, which showered Egypt with billions of dollars of aid, touching a nationalistic nerve.
Rights groups say he has led an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents, activists and critical media.
""I pledge that the upcoming presidential election will be free and transparent .. and be characterized by equal opportunities between candidates,"" Sisi said. 
Those challenging Sisi describe a sweeping effort to kill off their campaigns before they have begun, with media attacks on candidates, intimidation of supporters, and a nomination process stacked in favour of the former general.
""There are people I know who are corrupt, I will not allow them to come near this chair,"" Sisi said earlier in the ceremony without elaborating. 
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik, seen as the most serious potential challenger to date, said he was no longer considering a bid following a firestorm of criticism from state-aligned media and speculation that he was being held by authorities in a Cairo hotel. 
His most high-profile challengers are former army chief of staff Sami Anan and human rights lawyer Khaled Ali, but neither is expected to garner enough votes to oust him.
Thousands of Sisi's supporters gathered at the Cairo stadium calling for the former military commander to run for a second term. Public figures, actors and parliamentarians were amongst the crowd.
""We wanted Mr. President to continue with us,"" Medhat al-Adl, a famous scriptwriter and poet, said from the podium as people cheered and waved the Egyptian flag and Sisi's portrait. ""This is not his will, this is the will of all of us,"" he added.
Egyptian presidents have often ""used false organic displays of popularity as part of their political propaganda toolkit,"" said Timothy Kaldas, non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. 
""Events like these seek to signal to the public that Sisi has enthusiastic popular support and this message is protected by the fact that anyone with access to the media is rarely allowed to suggest otherwise,"" Kaldas added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal authorities announced drug trafficking and weapons charges against a congressman from Honduras on Friday, the latest U.S. case accusing current and former officials of the Central American country of involvement in the drug trade.
Fredy Renan Najera Montoya, 41, was charged with conspiring to import ""huge quantities of cocaine"" into the United States, according to U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan.
Najera, who was also charged in an indictment filed Thursday in Manhattan federal court with carrying and using machine guns, could not be reached for comment and a lawyer for him could not immediately be identified.
""We are committed to attacking the drug trade at every level, regardless of a defendant's status,"" Berman said in a statement. ""We look forward to trying Najera on U.S. soil.""
James Margolin, a spokesman for Berman, said Najera was not in U.S. custody. He declined to comment on whether prosecutors would seek to have him extradited.
Prosecutors said that between 2009 and 2014, Najera assisted in large-scale trafficking of cocaine from Colombia and elsewhere through Honduras, which U.S. authorities have long identified as a major transshipment point for drugs being smuggled into the United States.
Najera helped arrange clandestine landing strips, protected by heavily armed gunmen, for aircraft ferrying cocaine into Honduras, the prosecutors said. They said the cocaine was then sold to Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and ultimately imported into the United States.
Najera was also charged with taking part in a cocaine trafficking operation that involved payment of a $50,000 bribe to Fabio Lobo, the son of former Honduran President Porfirio Lobo.
Prosecutors said in Thursday's indictment that drug traffickers paid bribes to Honduran officials, including members of the national congress, to ensure safe passage of drugs through the country.
Fabio Lobo was arrested in a DEA sting in 2015, pleaded guilty to conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and was sentenced to 24 years in prison in September.
U.S. prosecutors have charged several other prominent Hondurans with involvement in drug trafficking.
Yankel Rosenthal, who served as minister of investment under current President Juan Orlando Hernandez, was sentenced to two years and five months in prison on Friday after he pleaded guilty to attempting to launder drug proceeds on behalf of a Honduran lawyer.
Rosenthal's cousin, Yani Rosenthal, was previously sentenced to three years, and his father, former Honduran vice president Jaime Rosenthal, was charged but remains at large.

1112,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>",Trump administration says U.S. mistakenly backed China WTO accession in 2001,"By Lesley Wroughton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States mistakenly supported China's membership of the World Trade Organization in 2001 on terms that have failed to force Beijing to open its economy, the Trump administration said on Friday as it prepares to clamp down on Chinese trade.
""It seems clear that the United States erred in supporting China's entry into the WTO on terms that have proven to be ineffective in securing China's embrace of an open, market-orientated trade regime,"" the administration said in an annual report to Congress on China's compliance with WTO commitments.
""It is now clear that the WTO rules are not sufficient to constrain China's market-distorting behavior,"" the report said.
While the annual report from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office has long taken China to task for unfair trade practices, the first such review under U.S. President Donald Trump takes a harsher tone against Beijing.
It comes amid worsening trade tensions between the world's two largest economies and as the administration prepares actions to curb China's alleged theft of intellectual property. A decision in the so-called ""Section 301"" investigation is expected in the coming weeks.
The report also points at Russia's behavior, saying Moscow had no intention of complying with its WTO obligations, a trend the administration said was ""very troubling.""
A White House official said despite consultations with China, it had failed to follow through on promises of moving more toward a market-orientated economy and playing by international trading rules.
""The president and his principal advisor are united in the belief that this is a problem that has gone on for too long and needs to be addressed,"" the official said.
""In the past, conversations have focused more on discreet opening for discreet products, and what we're saying is systematically we’re not going to tolerate broad-based policy that attempts to promote state-led enterprises,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Trump told Reuters in an interview this week he was considering a big ""fine"" against China for forcing U.S. companies to transfer their intellectual property to China as a cost of doing business there.
While the administration is also looking at whether foreign imports of steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar panels are harming U.S businesses, China's alleged theft of intellectual property is a particular concern to Trump because it affects a large swath of American firms, the official said.
Trump did not specify what he meant by a ""fine"" against China, but the 1974 trade law that authorized an investigation into China’s alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property allows him to impose retaliatory tariffs on Chinese goods or other trade sanctions until China changes its policies.
In Beijing, many experts believe Washington is unwilling to pay the heavy economic price needed to upset prevailing trade dynamics between the two countries.
In the report released on Friday, Trump's trade envoy, Robert Lighthizer, said the global economy was threatened by major economies who undermined the global trading system.
""The global trading system is threatened by major economies who do not intend to open their markets to trade and participate fairly,"" Lighthizer said. ""This practice is incompatible with the market-based approach expressly envisioned by WTO members and contrary to the fundamental principles of the WTO.""
The Trump administration has already pledged to transform 164-member trade body and has blocked WTO judicial appointments in a move to win WTO reforms.

""What we want to do is see countries behave responsibly within the international trading system,"" the White House official said.

1113,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 05:03PM ET</span>","In year of drama and chaos, Pence quietly advances conservative agenda","By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the run-up to President Donald Trump’s decision last month to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, Vice President Mike Pence, a conservative Christian who had long advocated for the move, did something he does only selectively: speak up.
As intelligence and diplomatic officials warned against the change, Pence made a forceful “closing argument” in favor of it at a White House Situation Room meeting, leading a group that included senior adviser Jared Kushner and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, a senior administration official said.
Pence helped persuade Trump to fulfill a campaign promise and upend long-standing U.S. policy by declaring he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, over objections from Arab nations and many Western allies. 
In a year marked by chaos and infighting in Trump’s White House, Pence has been one of the most effective administration officials in advancing his own policy goals.
His behind-the-scenes influence - described in interviews with more than two dozen conservative activists, lawmakers and administration officials - adds another dimension to a man often ridiculed for his public obsequiousness to his boss.
As Pence has put his stamp on policy, he has strengthened his ties with conservative activists, donors and lawmakers - alliances that would serve him well should he decide to launch his own presidential bid in the future.
But while he is a darling of conservative Republicans, Pence is often to the right of mainstream America on social issues like gay rights. In 2015, as governor of Indiana, he was forced to revise a state “religious liberty” law he had signed which opponents say allowed discrimination against gays. 
Pence, who leaves on Friday for a trip to Egypt, Jordan and Israel, has made a mark on domestic policy as vice president. The former congressman staunchly opposes abortion rights and passionately supports de-regulation of business and shrinking the size of government.
While heading up the presidential transition a year ago, he placed several advocates who oppose abortion rights in key positions at the Health and Human Services department. 
HHS has made several decisions that have advanced the social conservative agenda, including broadening exemptions for employers who cite religious or moral reasons for refusing to cover birth control.
Pence led the charge for reinstating the so-called Mexico City policy that requires foreign non-governmental organizations that receive U.S. funding to vow to not discuss or perform abortions. The policy expanded under the Trump administration to apply to the majority of U.S. global health assistance, which totals more than $8 billion.
For months, Pence has pushed for redirecting aid money from the United Nations to the U.S. Agency for International Development so it can be directed to Christians in the Middle East.
Earlier this month, USAID, citing Pence’s remarks, said it renegotiated the terms of an agreement so that $5 million will go to addressing the needs of “vulnerable religious and ethnic minority communities” in Iraq.
Pence has also been central to the administration’s legislative efforts, including the tax cuts passed last year. Several conservative activists said he helped generate momentum by bringing in conservative groups to get their input and support.
Early last year, when thousands of activists began arriving in the U.S. capital for the annual “March for Life” anti-abortion rights event Trump, then a Washington novice, asked Pence about it. The vice president described its importance in marking the anniversary of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.
The discussion prompted Trump to send Pence to speak at the march and on Friday Trump himself addressed this year's event via satellite. He criticized U.S. abortion laws as among the most permissive in the world. 
AGREEING TO DISAGREE
In an administration where staff such as Steve Bannon, the president’s former strategist, and Reince Priebus, the former chief of staff, have seen their stars rise and fall, Pence’s lasting influence owes to a number of factors, his associates say.
As vice president, he cannot be fired and therefore has less incentive than other aides to engage in building fiefdoms and jockeying for power. Advisers say that is not his style anyway.
“Inside of palace intrigue, there’s often power centers. And I don’t think there’s a Mike Pence power center,” said Marc Short, Trump’s legislative affairs director and a former Pence aide. “He’s here to serve the president’s interests, and so therefore there’s not an alternative agenda that people have to worry about.”
His mild-mannered style has helped him to stay out of the fray. For example, with outsized personalities like Bannon – who was fired in August – Pence avoided tensions by agreeing to disagree when differences arose.
Pence’s deference has endeared him to Trump, who highly values loyalty. The vice president is careful to praise his boss and hew to his positions, even in closed-door meetings when Trump is not present.
Critics of Pence say he effectively validates Trump’s often erratic behavior by quietly accepting the president’s combative instincts. 
Pence and others were widely mocked for a Cabinet meeting in which Trump went round the room to hear senior officials lavish praise on him. Pence said at the meeting it was ""the greatest privilege of my life"" to serve as Trump’s vice president. 
Congressional Democrats complain that Pence has not made a serious effort to work with them.
Pence has solidified relationships with outside groups and Republican lawmakers whose help the administration needs in enacting its policy agenda.
“The people that he talks to or interacts with and the way he treats them is (as if) they’re the most important person in the room,” said Republican Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus.

The lawmaker recounted an instance, during an Oval Office meeting, in which Pence gave up his seat and moved to another one so that Meadows could sit next to Trump.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Six months into laying the groundwork for his presidential bid, Egyptian hopeful Mohamed Anwar Sadat hit a snag: he could not find a hotel prepared to hire him a space to launch his campaign.
""One said they were completely booked for a year ... another told us they got instructions from security agencies not to hold a conference for this person,"" said Osama Badie, his media coordinator for the campaign.
Printers refused to print Sadat's manifesto, Badie said. He declined to name the three major Cairo hotels that had turned down the campaign and did not identify five printing firms that had declined to do business with them.
Those challenging President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in an election to be held in March describe a sweeping effort to kill off their campaigns before they begin, with media attacks on candidates, intimidation of supporters, and a nomination process stacked in favor of the former general.
Egypt's electoral commission declined to immediately comment on opposition concerns. The government press office did not immediately respond to questions about the candidates' assertions when contacted by Reuters by telephone and in writing.
The electoral commission has pledged to run the vote ""according to principles of independence, transparency and objectivity"". 
Sisi announced late on Friday that he would run for a second term as president. The election is Egypt's third since the 2011 uprising that deposed President Hosni Mubarak.
Campaigning is due to begin on Jan. 20, but opposition organizers say their efforts to get their campaigns off the ground are being stifled.
Citing safety concerns for his campaign team, Sadat, 62, whose uncle, President Anwar Sadat, was assassinated in 1981, abruptly dropped out of the race this week. 
""It's a systematic campaign to kill off candidates. I call it a political assassination process,"" Badie told Reuters from Sadat's headquarters just after the withdrawal. 
Former prime minister and air force commander Ahmed Shafik, seen as the most serious potential challenger to Sisi, also pulled out this month, saying he had spent too much time out of the country and was out of touch with Egyptian politics.
Shafik returned to Egypt from the United Arab Emirates in December after announcing his intention to run, and was met by widespread criticism from state-aligned media.
The 76-year-old narrowly lost a presidential election to Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Mursi in 2012 before fleeing for the United Arab Emirates, where he had since lived.
""Even the limited margins of opposition and critique and freedoms that were allowed under Mubarak are not allowed right now. It's zero tolerance, 100 percent control,"" said Ashraf El Sherif, political science professor at the American University in Cairo, citing what he said was a crackdown on grassroots activists.
'THE REAL FIGHT'
Sisi, a former military commander, won a landslide election victory in 2014, a year after he led the overthrow of Mursi, Egypt's first freely-elected president.
Sisi's potential challengers say the fiercest fight now is getting on the ballot.
Election regulations stipulate that would-be candidates must obtain the backing of at least 20 members of parliament or be supported by at least 25,000 eligible voters in at least 15 governorates through pledges of support submitted at notary offices.
Lawmakers have so far only provided nomination pledges for Sisi. His rivals have had to dash across the country to drum up pledges before the nomination window closes on Jan. 29.
Khaled Ali, a human rights lawyer and presidential hopeful, said the process of collecting pledges has been marred by fraud.
Ali's campaign organizers say payments are being made for Sisi pledges while their supporters face intimidation when they try to submit their own. The organizers say plainclothes security officers present at the notary offices were asking people if they supported Sisi. 
""The fight to gather nomination pledges is the real fight in these elections,"" Ali said on Wednesday. 
A Reuters reporter visiting three notary offices in Cairo witnessed about 10 Egyptian voters discussing when they would receive payments they had been promised in return for supporting Sisi and how much they would be paid. 
Ali's campaign organizers said payments were being made by companies and individuals supporting Sisi, but Reuters was unable to determine where the payments ultimately came from.
The campaign for Sami Anan, a former military chief of staff, told Reuters that many of their pledges were going unprocessed.
""The employees of these (notary) offices are saying that Anan's name is not listed on the system in the office and they need instructions on how to process his nomination pledges,"" said Sami Balah, the secretary general of a party nominating Anan.

Balah did not identify the notary offices. The electoral commission declined to comment on his assertion about the offices, whose employees are not authorized to speak to the media.

1115,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 03:13PM ET</span>",U.S. health agency revokes Obama-era Planned Parenthood protection,"By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Caroline Humer
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. health officials said on Friday they were revoking legal guidance issued by the Obama administration that had sought to discourage states from trying to defund organizations that provide abortion services, such as Planned Parenthood.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials also said the department was issuing a new regulation aimed at protecting healthcare workers' civil rights based on religious and conscience objections.
The regulation protects the rights of healthcare workers from providing abortion, euthanasia, and sterilization, the officials said during a media call with reporters.
On Thursday, HHS said it was creating a new division that would focus on conscience and religious objections, a move it said was necessary after years of the federal government forcing healthcare workers to provide such services.
HHS will issue a letter on Friday to state Medicaid offices rescinding 2016 guidance that the Obama administration gave after states including Indiana had tried to defund abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood.
The guidance ""restricted states' ability to take certain actions against family-planning providers that offer abortion services,"" HHS said in a statement. 
The Medicaid program, jointly funded by states and the federal government, provides healthcare services to the poor and disabled. Federal law prohibits Medicaid or any other federal funding for abortion services. 
The move is the Trump administration's latest effort to roll back policies developed under former President Barack Obama.
""You are watching a struggle over abortion politics,"" said Robin Wilson, a professor at University of Illinois College of Law. ""In a sense you're allowing state Medicaid regulators, through regulation, to reopen a whole can of worms around women’s health.""
Wilson said the impact could be immediate in states which, before the Obama-era guidance, had been working to effectively defund or limit funding to providers such as Planned Parenthood, which provide abortions but bill them separately so that they are not paid for by Medicaid.
Dawn Laguens, executive vice president for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said the move encourages states to block access to care at Planned Parenthood.
""The law is clear: it is illegal to bar women from seeking care at Planned Parenthood. Longstanding protections within Medicaid safeguard every person's right to access care at their qualified provider of choice,"" Laguens said in a statement.
NEW RULE 
The rule will enforce statutes that guarantee these civil rights. Roger Severino, director of the Office of Civil Rights at HHS, said the office had received 34 complaints since Trump took office last January.

Experts on Thursday said the move to protect workers on religious grounds raised the possibility it could provide legal cover for otherwise unlawful discrimination, and encourage a broader range of religious objections.

PUERTO MALDONADO, Peru (Reuters) - Pope Francis issued a ringing defense of the people and the environment of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Friday, saying big business and ""consumerist greed"" could not be allowed to destroy a natural habitat vital for the entire planet.
Francis, who has made the environment and climate change a focus of his nearly five-year-old pontificate, made his appeal while visiting a corner of the Amazon in Peru where pristine rainforest and biodiversity is being blighted by mining and logging, much of it illegal.
""The native Amazonian peoples have probably never been so threatened on their own lands as they are at present,"" the pope told a crowd of indigenous people from more than 20 groups including the Harakbut, Esse-ejas, Shipibos, Ashaninkas and Juni Kuin.
Thousands of representative of the groups from across Peru walked before him, dressed in traditional regional costumes and feather headdresses and speaking in their native languages, as traditional wind instruments sounded mournfully in a small stadium built to look like a hut in the city of Puerto Maldonado.
Francis decried the ""pressure being exerted by big business interests"" seeking petroleum, gas, lumber, and gold and plundering ""supplies for other countries without concern for its inhabitants."" 
The pope, whose speech was punctuated by repeated applause and beating of drums, spoke after listening to rainforest residents decry what they called the rape of their land. 
""They enter our territories without consulting us and we will suffer a lot when foreigners drill the earth... and destroy our rivers turning them into black waters of death,"" Hector Sueyo, an indigenous Harakbut, told the pope forcefully.
The southeastern region of Peru known as ""Madre de Dios,"" Spanish for ""Mother of God,"" has been badly blighted in recent years by unregulated gold mining, with one effect being dangerous levels of mercury in rivers. Illegal loggers and drug traffickers in other parts of the Peruvian Amazon have killed activists and attacked indigenous tribes that shun contact with outsiders. 
While more regulated, foreign companies have eagerly eyed the Camisea gas reserves in the neighboring region of Cusco. In northern Peru more than a dozen oil spills from a state-operated pipeline have polluted native lands.
""We cannot use goods meant for all as consumerist greed dictates. Limits have to be set that can help preserve us from all plans for a massive destruction of the habitat that makes us who we are,"" the pope said.
On the first papal visit to the Amazon since John Paul II visited the northern Peruvian city of Iquitos in 1985, the Argentine pope said he had heard the ""cry of the people."" He promised that he and the Church would offer them ""a whole-hearted option for the defense of life, the defense of the earth and the defense of cultures.""
Indigenous chiefs in Peru hope the pope's visit will persuade the government of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker, to give native communities titles to ancestral land and help preserving it.
""We're the ones who have been fighting to protect the Amazon the longest,"" Julio Cusurichi, the chief of the indigenous federation FENAMAD in Madre de Dios, said in an interview. 
COLONIALISM 'DISGUISED AS PROGRESS'
Alberto Fernandez, a 44-year-old flower shop owner in Puerto Maldonado, said he hoped the Pope would help contain the social ills that have accompanied the city's rapid growth.
""There's a lot of need here ... every day there are more bars and cantinas, more prostitution, more illegal mining ... 30 years ago Puerto wasn't like this,"" Fernandez said. ""There were only a couple paved streets, but we lived in peace."" 
The pope urged local authorities and bishops to work to defend young people and women from violence and human trafficking and to improve education and preserve local cultures.
""Special care is demanded of us, lest we allow ourselves to be ensnared by ideological forms of colonialism, disguised as progress, that slowly but surely dissipate cultural identities and establish a uniform, single ... and weak way of thinking,"" he said after watching traditional Ashaninka and Shipibo dances. 
Isolated tribes that shun contact with outsiders were the most vulnerable and must be defended, he said. 

Francis, who has also visited neighboring Chile on his trip to South America, bade goodbye to Puerto Maldonado in the Quechua language, and was presented with a native headdress and tapestry.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday the Iran nuclear deal cannot survive if the United States pulls out of the agreement. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said a week ago that European allies and Congress have to work with him to fix ""the disastrous flaws"" in the nuclear pact or face a U.S. exit. Trump wants it strengthened with a separate agreement within 120 days.
""This agreement cannot be implemented if one of the participants unilaterally steps out of it. It will fall apart, there will be no deal then,"" Lavrov told reporters at the United Nations in New York.
Lavrov said he believed the United States was ""going to try to convince the European states to take the same position that Washington has taken.""
Most U.N. and Western sanctions on Iran were lifted two years ago under the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and key world powers, which is enshrined in a United Nations Security Council resolution.
""It cannot keep alive in a re-negotiated form, especially regarding the demands by the United States. It would not be acceptable for Iran and it is clear now, I believe, that the Europeans do understand this danger right now,"" Lavrov said. 

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said the deal was not renegotiable.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former member of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez's cabinet was sentenced by a New York federal judge to nearly 2-1/2 years in prison on Friday, after pleading guilty to attempting to launder drug money from the Central American country.
Yankel Rosenthal, who served as minister of investment under Hernandez, received his 29-month term from U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in Manhattan. He was also fined $50,000.
Rosenthal, 49, pleaded guilty in August, admitting that he tried to buy a property for $1 million in Florida on behalf of a lawyer he knew in Honduras.
He said he knew the lawyer did business with drug traffickers and suspected the money was from drug sales, but went ahead with the deal anyway, planning to take a commission for himself.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Emil Bove said at the hearing that the deal never closed only because the seller backed out. Samidh Guha, a lawyer for Rosenthal, did not dispute that.
In a courtroom filled with family and friends, Rosenthal said before being sentenced that he regretted his actions but was ""not a threat to society.""
""I don't need to rehabilitate myself,"" he said. ""I need to redeem myself in the eyes of my god, family and my country.""
Prosecutors had sought a sentence of at least five years, citing federal guidelines, while Rosenthal's lawyers had asked for time served.
Koeltl agreed that guidelines called for more than five years, but said the lighter sentence was warranted because Rosenthal never closed the real estate deal and had a history of charitable giving.
Rosenthal gave up the right to appeal any sentence below federal guidelines as part of his plea deal.
He had been arrested in October 2015 and released on bail two months later, court records show.
U.S. prosecutors have also charged Rosenthal's father Jaime Rosenthal, a former vice president of Honduras; his cousin Yani Rosenthal, a veteran politician and two-time presidential candidate; and Andres Acosta Garcia, a lawyer with the family's Grupo Continental.
Prosecutors have said the three men took part in a long-running money laundering scheme involving the Cachiros, a Honduran drug trafficking ring.

Yani Rosenthal and Acosta Garcia have both pleaded guilty to money laundering. Yani Rosenthal was sentenced to three years in prison in December, while Acosta Garcia is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 26. Jaime Rosenthal remains at large.

This week NATO allies Germany and Turkey resumed bilateral government consultations, suspended after Ankara's arrest of German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel last February in a case that continues to divide the two countries.
The tentative thaw in relations followed the release of a number of Germans jailed in Turkey, and a meeting between German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu in Germany earlier this month.
After the meeting Gabriel instructed his office to put Turkey's request for the tank upgrades on the agenda and ""to look favourably"" at it, Spiegel said.
The German foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on the potential arms sales to Turkey.
Gabriel told reporters after his meeting with Cavusoglu that major arms sales to Turkey would remain off limits until Yucel's case had been resolved, but signaled at the time that Berlin would review Ankara's request to add protective gear to its existing tanks.
Turkey wants to add gear to reinforce the tanks against improvised explosive devices and mines, and is also seeking a sensor system that would protect the vehicles against anti-tank projectiles.
Spiegel said the likely approval of the tank upgrades was viewed by diplomats as ""a concession toward solving the crisis with Turkey and a step toward securing the release of the Die Welt journalist Yucel"".
Turkey accuses Yucel of spreading propaganda for the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). He denies the charge.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Istanbul authorities banned a planned performance on Friday of a play about a dictator, invoking powers granted under Turkey's state of emergency imposed after a failed coup attempt against President Tayyip Erdogan.
""Just a Dictator"" is an extended monologue delivered by the ruler of an unspecified country about his rise to power. As the dictator speaks, chants of angry protesters can be heard approaching his residence, but do little to intimidate him.
Earlier this week authorities started investigating theaters around the liberal district of Kadikoy, asking about the play, theater officials said.
On Friday morning police notified the theater that staging the play in any open or enclosed space within Kadikoy was banned, citing a law established under the state of emergency declared after the coup attempt in July 2016.
""It has been evaluated that the play may affect public order and safety negatively, endanger security and well-being of the public and disturb the environment of public peace and trust,"" said a copy of the notice posted on Twitter by the theater.
It said the play was banned emergency rule that means ""any type of stage play (or) movie showing can be inspected and banned or stopped,"" to ensure public safety.
Human rights groups and Turkey's Western allies say Erdogan has used the failed 2016 coup as an excuse to quash dissent, and expressed concern about a referendum last year which granted Erdogan sweeping new presidential powers.
The government says the crackdown, and the executive presidency approved by referendum last April are needed to confront mounting threats to national security. 
The play had previously been banned in three other provinces when it went on a tour, theater members said.
Authorities were not available to comment on Friday.
While the only character on stage throughout the performance is the dictator, the criticism targets the audience for their inability to stand up to him.
Even though Friday's showing was canceled, the theater called on ticketholders and members of other theaters in Kadikoy to join them in solidarity at the scheduled performance time.
The only actor, Baris Atay, an outspoken critic of Erdogan's policies, promised audiences they would eventually see the play.
""We have no expectations from a justice system that has turned into a toy in their hands, so we're not going to take this ban to court,"" he tweeted. ""But we promise you that 'Just a Dictator' will reach everyone. Very soon!""

The students say the system is too rigidly focused on rote-learning and blind memorisation of facts and does not encourage critical thinking or creativity.
In freezing rain, they held banners emblazoned with angry emoticons and messages such as ""I can feel I am getting dumber"" and ""My brain is shrinking.""
""This is fundamentally a reform protest, but we can also call it a protest against the government as it criticises the government's work in the field of education,"" said 17-year-old Balazs Fuzfa.
""I have come as I totally agree that the system of public education is in a bad state,"" added Flora Kokendi, 21, a university student.
Critics of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing government say it has failed to reform big state-run systems such as education and healthcare, which are also suffering from a big brain-drain of smart young Hungarians to western Europe. 
""A just, democratic and modern education for all students,"" said one leaflet prepared by the protest organisers which demanded a free choice of textbooks, a bigger student say in educational matters and a reduction in mandatory school hours.
Orban's Fidesz party, in power since 2010, is expected to win a third term in a row in an election set for April 8.

Orban has used his time in office to rewrite hundreds of laws, the constitution and to centralise power. His reforms, such as those affecting the judiciary and the media, have triggered conflicts with the European Union.

The armies of Congo and Uganda launched a military offensive last month against the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels, who were suspected of being behind a Dec. 8 attack on a U.N. base that killed 15 Tanzanian peacekeepers. 
A senior army source said that more than 20 other Congolese soldiers were also wounded after gunmen launched an attack during the night near the town of Eringeti in North Kivu province. Fighting continued into Friday morning, he said.
""The combat continues and our goal is to recapture all the ADF positions in all strategic locations to keep them from organizing,"" said the senior officer, who asked not to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the press.
A senior Congolese security official confirmed the attack as did a foreign diplomat, who said information he had received put the death toll at 22 Congolese soldiers killed.
""We are at war. And when you are at war, ambushes are possible. That does not surprise me,"" Congolese Defence Minister Crispin Atama Tabe told reporters in the capital Kinshasa when asked about the attack.

The Baltic country's border guard said on Friday it had found thousands of packets of cigarettes attached beneath blocks of ice on the river Neris, which runs into Lithuania from Belarus, since the ice began flowing two weeks ago.
Around 1,000 packs were found last week and another 1,500 packs on Friday. The iceblocks carried GPS trackers to aid retrieval.
""This is the first time we find cigarettes underneath the ice. However, smugglers continuously attempt to use that stretch of the river,"" border guard spokesman Rokas Pukinskas told Reuters. ""The imagination of these people knows no limits.""
The cigarettes, which are about four times more expensive in Lithuania than in Belarus, were worth an estimated 8,000 euros, Pukinskas said.
KPMG came up with the one in six figure for smuggled cigarettes in a research report last year. That was the highest ratio in the European Union after Latvia, Greece and Ireland, the auditing firm said.
Most come from Belarus, where taxes on tobacco are far lower than in Lithuania, and some are then sold on for even larger profits in countries such as Britain and Ireland, KPMG said.

The Lithuanian government has said it lost 50 million euros in unpaid taxes in 2015 alone due to tobacco smuggling.

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzanian President John Magufuli on Friday put a temporary ban on the registration of foreign ships in the country and ordered over 400 vessels to be investigated for allegations of involvement in criminal activity.
The ban came after at least five foreign-owned ships flying Tanzania's flag were seized in various parts of the world carrying illegal consignments of weapons and narcotics.The maritime authority in the Indian Ocean archipelago of Zanzibar has in previous years been accused of allowing Iranian and North Korean vessels to use the Tanzanian flag to circumvent United Nations sanctions.
Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous territory of Tanzania.""He (Magufuli) issued the instructions ... following reports on the seizure of narcotics in at least five vessels flying the Tanzanian flag,"" the Tanzanian president's office said in a statement.Tanzania said in 2012 that a shipping agent based in Dubai had reflagged 36 Iranian oil tankers with its flag without the country's knowledge and approval and de-registered the vessels after an investigation.North Korea is subject to international sanctions imposed over its nuclear programs. Sanctions on Iran linked to its nuclear programs were lifted in January 2016, though some of its vessels often operate under other flags for reasons of convenience.
Reflagging ships masks their ownership, which could make it easier for criminal networks and sanctioned nations to obtain insurance and financing for the cargoes, as well as find buyers for the shipments without attracting attention from the U.N. and other international authorities.""I want you to conduct a thorough investigation to vet all the 470 ships that fly the Tanzanian flag,"" Magufuli told security forces.  ""We cannot allow the image of our country to continue being undermined by some people for their own interests.""

Magufuli said the ban on the registration of foreign ships would be in force until the system of reflagging vessels was reviewed. The Greek coastguard on Jan. 6 impounded a Tanzania-flagged freighter carrying explosives, allegedly destined to war-torn Libya. Dutch naval forces in December intercepted a Tanzania-flagged merchant vessel carrying 1.6 tonnes of cocaine.Tanzania said it has already revoked the registration of the two latest foreign-owned ships seized with illegal consignments of narcotics and weapons.

Most of the Venezuelan migrants lack visas and have fled food shortages and the world's steepest inflation by crossing the 2,219 km (1,379-mile) porous border to Colombia.
While Venezuelan engineers work in Colombia's oil industry and many professionals have flocked to the capital city Bogota, a growing number of poor people from that country have settled in Colombian border towns. In Cucuta, close to the Venezuelan border, many sleep in parks and wash their laundry in creeks. 
The influx has forced Colombia to grapple with migrants arriving in need of food, shelter and medical care, often given at the government's expense. 
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
More than 650,000 Venezuelans passed through Colombia on their way to other countries or returned home during 2017, the authority said in a report.
""Close to 60 percent of Venezuelan citizens who left our country left for destinations other than Venezuela,"" migration head Christian Kruger said in the report. 
About 1.3 million Venezuelans have registered for a special migration card that allows them to cross the border by day to buy food and other products that are scarce in their own country. 
On an average day in 2017, more than 30,000 Venezuelans used the cards to enter and leave Colombia across the land border, where smugglers thrive by selling increasingly unavailable but heavily subsidized Venezuelan products to Colombians.
Of those Venezuelans living in Colombia, 126,000 have legal permission to stay, including some 69,000 who have taken advantage of a humanitarian visa introduced in July, the report said.

The United Nations is willing to send more aid to Colombia to help the country cope with the arriving migrants, Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on a visit to the Andean country last week.

SUGEDIGI, Turkey (Reuters) - Turkish artillery fired into Syria's Afrin region on Friday in what Ankara said was the start of a military campaign against the Kurdish-controlled area.
The cross-border bombardment took place after days of threats from Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to crush the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in Afrin in response to growing Kurdish strength across a wide stretch of north Syria.
""The operation has actually de facto started with cross-border shelling,"" Turkish Defence Minister Nurettin Canikli said, adding that no troops had crossed into Afrin.
Direct military action against territory held by Kurdish militia would open a new front in Syria's civil war and would see Ankara confronting Kurds allied to the United States at a time when Turkey's relations with Washington are reaching the breaking point. 
The U.S. State Department has called on Turkey to focus on the fight against Islamic State militants and not take military action in Afrin.
Reuters TV filmed Turkish artillery at the border village of Sugedigi firing on Friday morning into Afrin region, and the YPG militia said Turkish forces fired 70 shells at Kurdish villages between midnight and Friday morning. Shelling continued in the late afternoon, said Rojhat Roj, a YPG spokesman in Afrin. 
Roj said it was the heaviest Turkish bombardment since Ankara stepped up threats to take military action against the Kurdish region. 
""YPG is ready to confront Turkish troops and FSA terrorists. If they dare to attack, we are ready to bury them one by one in Afrin,” a YPG statement said.
But Canikli said Ankara was determined to destroy the Kurdish group. ""All terror networks and elements in northern Syria will be eliminated. There is no other way,"" he said.
""The operation in central Afrin may last a long time, but the terrorist organization will swiftly come undone there.""
Although Canikli said no Turkish troops have gone into Afrin, Turkish newspapers said 20 buses carrying Free Syrian Army rebels crossed on Friday from Turkey into a Turkish-controlled part of northern Syria, on Afrin's eastern flank.
They said the FSA rebels would deploy near the town of Azaz, where Kurdish shelling overnight struck a psychiatric hospital.
The Turkish armed forces said several civilians wounded in the attack were taken to Turkey for treatment, and Turkish television footage showed rubble and damaged walls.
TENSION WITH U.S.
Turkey has been angered by U.S. military support for the Kurdish YPG-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces which spearheaded the fight against Islamic State in Syria, and by an announcement that the United States would stay in Syria to train about 30,000 personnel in the swathe of eastern Syria under SDF control.
Turkey says the YPG is a terrorist group and a branch of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party which has waged an insurgency in southeast Turkey for decades, and Canikli criticized Washington for its continued emphasis on countering Islamic State.

""The threat of Daesh has been removed in both Syria and Iraq. With this reality out in the open, a 'focus on Daesh' statement is truly a meaningless remark,"" he said.

Rubio, whose departure was announced by Meade's campaign, is due to be replaced by Miguel Messmacher, the deputy minister for revenue, a ministry official familiar with the matter said.
Meade was in charge of the finance ministry until stepping down to seek the presidential candidacy for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in late November. Rubio said on Twitter she would act as Meade's office coordinator.
The campaign of the 48-year-old Meade has struggled to gain traction and escape the taint of corruption surrounding the PRI and Mexico's unpopular president, Enrique Pena Nieto.
A poll this week showed Meade losing ground to leftist front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, leaving him stuck in third place in the race to win the July election.
Also joining the finance ministry is Juan Pablo Newman, who will leave his role as chief financial officer at state oil company Pemex to head the ministry's public credit unit, according to three people familiar with the matter.
The changes require Senate approval, which is likely to be a formality. Congress is in recess, but the legislature's permanent commission can also ratify the appointments.

The finance ministry is now run by former Pemex chief executive officer Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya.

The scuffles outside Fleury Merogis prison, one of Europe's largest with 3,800 inmates, coincided with news from a jail in Corsica that two security guards were attacked and injured by inmates. It is the latest in a series of assaults that have overshadowed France's prison system in the past week.
""We're fed up. We're taking a thumping inside and now we're being thumped outside,"" jail guard Thibault Capelle said after police advancing with shields and using tear gas broke up a picket at the entrance of Fleury Merogis, on the southern outskirts of Paris.
The protests there and at many other prisons began a week ago, after an Islamist militant jailed over the killing of 21 people in Tunisia in 2000 slashed guards on the head and torso with a pair of scissors in northern France.
With pressure mounting, President Emmanuel Macron said last week a plan would be presented in February to tackle the issue. It would go beyond an existing promise to build thousands of new prison cells, he said.
France's prison population has more than doubled since the 1970s, to around 70,000, making it one of the highest in Europe.
INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM
The incident in Corsica prompted rapid publication of a statement of sympathy by Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet, who was accused of responding sluggishly to earlier assaults.
Maxime Coustie, representative of staff at Corsica's Borgo jail, said several inmates struck one guard in the back with a sharp instrument and another in the face. Both were hospitalized. 
One of the assailants had attracted the attention of prison authorities after beginning to practise a more extreme form of Islam.
Radicalization among petty criminals is a growing concern in France after Islamist attacks that have killed close to 250 people in Paris and other cities over the past three years.
In addition to more staff and resources, prison guards want the country's 504 convicted Islamist militants isolated from other prisoners, said Wilfried Fonck, a jailguard unionist. 
Fleury Merogis, a sprawl of gloomy gray concrete dating to the 1960s, houses far more prisoners that it was built to take, making it a frequent target of international criticism. 
It is also the solitary-confinement home of Salah Abdeslam, suspected of being the sole survivor of an Islamist hit-squad that killed 130 people in Paris in late 2015.

Ethiopia freed a senior opposition leader, Merera Gudina, leader of the Oromo Federalist Congress party, on Wednesday, advancing efforts to calm political turmoil following violence and mass protests that shook the country in 2015 and 2016. He was arrested in late 2015 and charged with collusion with groups outlawed by the Addis Ababa government.
The ruling coalition has indicated that cases against some 400 other detainees held at the regional level are being discontinued, U.N. human rights spokesman Liz Throssell told a news briefing.
""These are positive developments. We urge the government to continue to take steps to release individuals detained for expressing their political views,"" Throssell said.
The opposition leader's release coincides with mounting concerns over the long-term stability of one of the fastest growing economies in the region.
""We do think that Ethiopia is at a key moment and that's why we are saying that we stand ready to help Ethiopia,"" Throssell said.
Hundreds were killed during two years of violence triggered by allegations of land grabs in Ethiopia's central Oromiya province, with protests then broadening into demonstrations over political restrictions and perceived rights abuses.
""We don't have an exact figure on the number of people that have been in detention. We do think that it is in the thousands,"" Throssell said, adding they included ""political detainees"".
""We have reports that during the unrest and the state of emergency, more than 20,000 people were detained. Some of those were subsequently released, but we do believe that there are still a high number of people in detention,"" she said.
Throssell urged the Ethiopian government to review anti-terror legislation and laws ""to ensure that they are neither interpreted nor implemented too broadly, thereby resulting in people being arbitrarily or wrongfully detained,"" she said.
Laws placing ""undue restrictions"" on non-governmental organizations and restricting the media should also be revised.

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Armenian president proposes ex-PM as successor in March vote,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenian President Serzh Sarksyan on Friday proposed the country's ambassador in Britain to run to succeed him in a March election, a move critics said could allow him to continue wielding ultimate power after a constitutional change.
The Armenian presidency will lose much of its powers after the election under constitutional amendments approved in a 2015 referendum, with the prime minister and parliament taking on more responsibilities and influence in the ex-Soviet republic.
Sarksyan, nearing the end of his second term, nominated Yerevan's envoy to London, Armen Sarkissian, 64, also a former prime minister, to run for president in the general election tentatively set for March 2.
""I, taking into account your abilities and qualifications, have proposed to my colleagues that you agree to run for president for our political force (ruling Republican Party),"" Sarksyan told Sarkissian at a televised meeting.
Sarkissian, a businessman seen as a political independent, replied that the proposal was an honor for him and that he would make a decision after meetings with politicians and members of the wider public. 
Opposition leaders cried foul, accusing Sarksyan of plans to move into the post of prime minister to continue ruling Armenia de facto after the presidency becomes a largely ceremonial post. He denied having any such intention. 
Armenian presidents will now be elected by a three-quarters majority of parliament, rather than voters, and serve only one seven-year term under the constitutional amendments. The opposition has yet to announce its candidate for the March vote.
The Republican Party (RPA) won parliamentary elections in April last year with 49 percent of the vote while the opposition Tsarukyan Alliance took 27 percent.
Sarksyan, 62, leader of the RPA and president since 2008, has repeatedly denied the constitutional changes were engineered to allow him to retain domination over Armenian politics.
Many Armenians accuse the government of corruption and of mishandling the troubled economy. Armenia depends heavily for aid and investment on Russia.

The Iraqi man, identified only by the initials A.Z., had been sent by Islamic State to Lebanon to form a new cell to carry out attacks, Machnouk said.
The Intelligence Division of Lebanon's Internal Security Force said in a statement at Machnouk's news conference that security services had tracked A.Z.'s activities in Iraq and after he arrived in Lebanon in June.
When it became clear he was planning to return to Iraq, he was arrested and turned into an informant.
For five months A.Z. carried on communicating with Islamic State abroad and working on the cell - all the while feeding information back to Lebanese security forces.
Islamic State asked him ""to exert maximum effort to carry out terror attacks in Lebanon especially during the holiday season and end of year celebrations"", the information division said. 
The operation was ended after intelligence showed Islamic State command abroad had become suspicious of A.Z. and the lack of attacks, it said.
A number of arrests were made as a result of the operation, Machnouk said. 
Lebanese authorities say they have foiled a number of Islamic State attacks and networks in the country since a 2015 bomb in a southern suburb of the capital killed at least 43. 
In August, Islamic State and other militants were cleared from the Lebanon-Syria border area after separate offensives by the Lebanese army and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah militia.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>","Slowly, Germany begins to ponder life after Merkel","By Paul Carrel and Andreas Rinke
BERLIN (Reuters) - She has not faced a credible challenge to her rule as German chancellor for more than 12 years. Now, members of Angela Merkel's conservatives are starting to look ahead to potential alternatives to lead their party and country.
Merkel's immediate fate depends on the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which votes on Sunday on whether their leaders should pursue coalition negotiations with her Christian Democrats after striking a preliminary deal last week.
A ""no"" vote could force fresh elections as well as renewed debate on the issue of succession.
Interviews by Reuters with more than a dozen party lawmakers indicate that the coalition talks have brought pressure from Merkel's party for new faces to be included in the next cabinet and prompted early conversations on a succession plan. 
""We need to talk about how the Union can renew itself,"" said Paul Ziemiak, who chairs the youth wing of the Union of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU), which run together in national elections on the same ticket.
Merkel herself decided to seek a fourth term only after long reflection, and said in November 2016 she was seeking to stay on ""if health allows"". In 1998 she was quoted as saying: ""I don't want to be a half-dead wreck when I leave politics."" On the other hand, she has not ruled out running for a 5th term.
The departure of Merkel, whose time in office has overlapped with four French presidents and four British prime ministers, risks creating a leadership vacuum in the European Union at a critical and uncertain time.
To smooth the transition, many in the CDU favor the idea of a gradual transition. That could involve handing the party chairmanship over first. 
Others want Merkel to go sooner, however, frustrated with her handling of the refugee crisis, which hurt the party in Sept. 24's national election. Lamenting their loss of support to the far right, they complain she lacks the common touch.
One CDU lawmaker, who admired Merkel's mastery of detail but complained she lacks empathy, said that handing over the chancellorship early would strengthen her successor and the party in the next election, due in 2021.
""Tactically, a chancellor has an incumbency advantage. That means there could be a change within the legislative period,"" the lawmaker said.
SUPERCHARGED DEBATE
The succession debate has been supercharged by the inclusion of a clause in the preliminary coalition deal with the SPD that envisages a review of the next government's progress after two years to assess whether any changes to its mission are needed.
""A good time for Merkel to resign,"" one CDU lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said of the review.
The risk of a handover at that point is that the SPD, if it agrees to govern with the conservatives, could pull the plug on the coalition and force fresh elections. But the situation also could come to a head far sooner.
Sunday's SPD vote is an immediate hurdle. If fresh elections are held, a small minority of lawmakers on the right of the CDU and in the CSU hope she would not run again for chancellor, according to those who spoke to Reuters. 
Others reject this idea.
""We are not of the view that if the SPD votes 'no' on Sunday, that this is the fault of the Union or the chancellor,"" said Detlef Seif, deputy EU spokesman for Merkel's conservative parliamentary bloc.
Merkel has said she would run again for chancellor in the event of new elections. Voters still respect her, polls show.
A Forsa poll published on Thursday showed support for Merkel's CDU/CSU bloc rose to 34 percent, slightly above its election result of 32.9 percent. Support for the SPD slipped to 18 percent, below the 20.5 percent it achieved in the election.
Many conservatives favor an orderly transition.
""I think a sensible succession arrangement must be found within the Union, but not at the moment given all that the chancellor has achieved, and not in the middle of a legislative period,"" said Seif.
One way, discussed by some other CDU lawmakers, of achieving an orderly handover would see Merkel relinquish the CDU party chair to a designated successor in 2020 while remaining chancellor, a scenario which would allow the person to raise their profile.
Merkel has in the past said she believes the party chair and chancellorship should be held by the same person.
The CDU botched its last leadership handover.
Late chancellor Helmut Kohl handed over the chairmanship to Wolfgang Schaeuble after his defeat at the 1998 election, only for them both to be compromised by a party funding scandal. Merkel then took over as leader, calling for a new start.
Schaeuble, highly respected by conservatives for imposing fiscal discipline on the euro zone during his time as finance minister, is perhaps the only CDU figure who could lead a putsch to oust Merkel. A trusted, if awkward, ally for Merkel, he is unlikely to do so. 
Younger contenders are circling, notably deputy finance minister Jens Spahn.

""Germans love orderly processes, but when it comes to handing over the chancellorship it doesn't happen,"" said Carsten Nickel at advisory firm Teneo Intelligence. ""I think there will be a lot of movement in the CDU in the next four years.""

1141,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>","Italy's center right vows deep tax cuts, funding unclear","By Isla Binnie and Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - A center-right grouping involving former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is pledging to slash taxes and throw out a drastic pension reform in its bid to win over voters at a national election in just over six weeks' time.
Late on Thursday, Berlusconi met his allies, the anti-immigrant Northern League and nationalist Brothers of Italy, to sign a 10-point pact, which does not spell out where they would find the money for the measures.
Parties across the spectrum are campaigning on promises to spend more and tax less, but Italy, weighed down by one of the world's largest public debt pile and weak productivity, has little room for maneuver within European Union budget rules. 
(Graphic: Italy's debt - http://reut.rs/2DjRa8S)
One entire section of the manifesto is devoted to ensuring ""Less restraint by Europe"", reflecting frequent complaints about Brussels from League leader Matteo Salvini and Brothers of Italy's Giorgia Meloni. 
Polls show the group in the lead ahead of the March 4 vote, but failing to muster enough support to govern alone, meaning it may have to make overtures to rivals to form a majority. 
First on the list is a flat tax, replacing the current system whereby the top tax rate is 43 percent, but the document published on Friday does not say what the new toll would be. 
However, Berlusconi said on his Mediaset TV network on Friday: ""We plan to start with the lowest current rate of 23 percent with the aim of slowly reducing it, if revenue rises.""
The League, which polls around 13 percent versus roughly 16 percent for Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!), has called for the rate to be set at 15 percent.
In line with the ""Italians first"" credo promoted by Salvini and Meloni, the manifesto gives the Italian constitution precedence over legislation approved by the European parliament. 
The allies promise to review EU treaties, reject austerity and pay less into the bloc's budget, but there is no mention of any plan to exit the euro. Both the League and Brothers of Italy want an orderly break-up of the currency union. 
All outstanding litigation over tax matters would stop, and there would be an amnesty for ""smaller payers who find themselves in economic difficulty"". The agency responsible for collecting overdue taxes, Equitalia, would be closed, leaving local authorities to do the job.
Also in the firing line is a 2012 overhaul of the pension system, made at the height of Italy's sovereign debt crisis, which linked retirement age to life expectancy. 
The parties promise a new welfare system, and to hike the lowest pensions. Small-denomination, interest-free bonds would be issued to firms and individuals owed money by the state. 
All illegal immigrants would be repatriated, boat migrants would be blocked from arriving and rules on asylum would change.
Former prime minister Mario Monti has scolded politicians for making ""irresponsible"" promises in the campaign, but a survey published last week showed most Italians did not like or believe any of the pledges anyway.

The parties have not united behind one prime ministerial candidate, deciding instead that whoever gets the most votes chooses the premier. Salvini is campaigning hard for the post, but Berlusconi said on Thursday he would be ready to lead again if a ban on his holding public office is overturned.

1142,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>","German election would further harm SPD, Schulz warns","By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN (Reuters) - The leader of Germany's Social Democrats on Friday urged members of his center-left party to endorse coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives or risk facing new elections that could further damage the party.
The SPD is scrambling to rally support among rank-and-file party members for formal negotiations with the conservatives about another ""grand coalition"" -- a move opposed by outspoken members of the party's youth and left wings.
Nearly four months after a national election, Merkel has still not managed to form a government. Refusal by SPD delegates to hold further talks could lead to new elections or a minority government for the first time in Germany's post-war era.
Many experts fear that new elections could further strengthen the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which entered parliament for the first time in September.
The process would also further exacerbate uncertainty that has raised questions about the future of Europe's largest economy and Merkel's quest for a fourth term in office.
Rejection of the talks ""would lead to new elections, and in pretty short order"", SPD leader Martin Schulz told weekly news magazine Der Spiegel. He said the SPD -- which posted its worst result since 1933 in September's election -- was likely to see further losses in any new poll.
""If the parties do not succeed in forming a government with the majorities in the Bundestag, then voters will punish them,"" he told the magazine.
Schulz also expressed impatience with those who argue that the SPD must reinvent itself in opposition, arguing that it had the power now to improve the lives of everyday Germans.
""I don't want the geriatric nurse to have to wait four years for better working conditions just so the SPD feels better,"" he said. 
The leader of the SPD's youth wing, Kevin Kuehnert, and other opponents of another coalition government, say the blueprint hammered out with conservatives falls too far short of SPD goals.
Schulz and his backers insist the blueprint will benefit German citizens, and dampened hopes that formal coalition talks would result in significantly different results. 
""The exploratory talks created a framework for what is possible and what isn't,"" he said. ""After all, we don't want the other side to question things that we fought for and won.""
A new poll by broadcaster ZDF showed that 64 percent of Germans -- and 75 percent of SPD members -- expect SPD delegates to approve further talks with Merkel's conservatives.
The SPD has vowed to leave the final decision on whether to enter government to members in a vote by mail.
The poll showed that only 45 percent of Germans were in favor of another grand coalition, although 68 percent of conservatives were in favor, and 57 percent of SPD members.

Conservatives would win 33 percent if the next election were held on Sunday, the poll showed, up one percentage point from a poll last week. The SPD would win just 20 percent of the vote, down three points from last week.

CONAKRY (Reuters) - A Saudi Arabian Islamic preacher was killed in eastern Guinea after proselytizing to hunting communities in a remote region near the Mali border, police and lawyers said on Friday. 
The preacher's death in the village of Kantedou Balandou on Tuesday was followed by the fatal stabbing on Wednesday of the head of a group of hunters, which authorities said was likely to have been a revenge killing.
It was not yet clear who was responsible for the deaths.
But they shed some light on the breadth of Saudi ambitions to spread conservative Salafist Islam in rural West Africa, and the sometimes violent opposition they face from people practicing traditional religions. 
""I can confirm that a Saudi preacher was shot dead on Tuesday,"" said police spokesman Boubacar Kasse. ""Initial information tells us that the victim was taken after his preaching. The day after this incident, a young local man stabbed the chief of the traditional hunters,"" he said.
Authorities declined to release the identity of the dead. The Saudi embassy in Conakry did not respond to a request for comment.
Saudi Arabia has spent millions of dollars to win converts to its strict form of Islam in Africa and gain influence. That has raised concerns of radicalization, especially in West Africa where the more tolerant Sufi Islam has historically been more dominant. 
Guinea is predominantly Muslim, but many in rural areas have been practicing traditional religions for centuries. In those places the reception to foreign Islamic preachers can be hostile. 
According to police spokesman Kasse, the dead Saudi was part of a group of five preachers, including three Guineans and one other Saudi. 
When the preaching began, a group of onlookers began to boo, said William Fernandez, the Attorney General of the nearby Kankan Court of Appeal. The preacher tried to escape on a motor bike but was caught and killed, he said. 
The next day, the man who killed the chief of a group of traditional hunters shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is Greatest"", in Arabic) before committing the act, Fernandez said, citing testimony from residents. A man is in custody for the crime.

LONDON (Reuters) - London Mayor Sadiq Khan joined a chorus of protest on Friday against a government decision not to block the release from jail of a former black-cab driver suspected of assaulting dozens, possibly hundreds of women.
Khan said it was ""extremely disappointing"" that the government was not challenging a decision by the Parole Board to free John Warboys, 60, after nine years in prison.
The opposition Labour Party, of which Khan is a member, also called it deeply regrettable.
Worboys, one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders, was convicted in 2009 of raping or sexually assaulting 12 women. However, police fear he may have had more than 100 victims.
On Friday, justice minister David Gauke told parliament he had received legal advice that suggested launching a judicial review of the Parole Board decision would not be successful.
Mayor Khan, who has previously said Worboys should not be allowed to set foot in London, said he had instructed lawyers to explore the possibility of a legal challenge from him. 
The decision to release Worboys is ""astonishing and it is extremely disappointing that the government is accepting this without challenge,"" Khan said in a statement. 
Warboys' release has provoked outrage from campaigners against sexual violence and exposed failings in the justice system after some of his victims were not informed of the decision to release him. 
Gauke declined to explain his decision further, saying that publishing the legal advice could harm attempts by other groups to challenge his release.
Warboys, a licensed London black-cab driver, used alcohol and drugs to incapacitate his victims between 2002 and 2008. 
He told some women he had won money at a casino or lottery and offered them spiked champagne laced with sedatives in an invitation to celebrate with him. 
He then pounced on the victims in the back of his black cab and many were left with little memory of their ordeals and could only recall falling asleep in the back of the vehicle before waking up at home.
In 2009, the former male stripper was convicted of 19 offences of drugging and sexually assaulting women and ordered to serve at least eight years in jail. Worboys spent just under 10 years in custody, including a period on remand.
A three-member panel of the Parole Board decided at the end of last year Worboys could be released as he no longer presented a risk to the public.

PUERTO MALDONADO, Peru (Reuters) - Two decades ago, Swiss priest Xavier Arbex started sounding alarms about a looming environmental disaster in the remote Amazonian region of Peru where he had settled.
Wildcat miners who once sifted for gold alongside rivers using wheelbarrows and buckets had started tearing through pristine rainforest with heavy machinery.
""I knew this was going to be a big problem,"" Arbex said, describing his attempts to enlist heavyweight environmental groups to stop the pending disaster. ""No-one listened.""
Wildcat gold mining in Peru has since flourished into a black market trade estimated to be worth billions of dollars a year. In addition to the environmental devastation, it has spawned human trafficking and violent criminal networks in distant corners of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Seeking to shine a light on the problem, Pope Francis will visit the jungle region of Madre de Dios (Mother of God) on Friday. It will be the pontiff's first stop outside the capital Lima on a three-day tour of Peru, which follows a trip to neighboring Chile.
While Francis has denounced environmental degradation before, he has yet to do so in a place as threatened as Madre de Dios, parts of which have still been trod only by reclusive tribes and the odd explorer.
In recognition of Arbex's cause, Francis will visit a home for troubled youth that the aging priest founded in the regional capital Puerto Maldonado, a riverside town buzzing with motorcycles and the psychedelic sounds of cumbia dance music near Peru's border with Brazil and Bolivia.
""We'll finally be the center of attention,"" said Eduardo Farfan, a 30-year-old owner of a menswear shop in Puerto Maldonado, where posters welcoming the pope hung from wooden homes. ""When I go to Lima to buy clothes, some people have no idea where Puerto Maldonado is.""
Successive political leaders in Peru have failed to slow the illegal gold rush. President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski's plan to ""formalize"" miners who comply with labor and environmental laws has been derailed by crises in his center-right government.
As mining has become the motor of the local economy in Madre de Dios, helping elect a former wildcat miner as governor, it has turned increasingly violent.
Park rangers are regularly harassed by miners near the Tambopata nature reserve. Last year, authorities announced the discovery of a pit near mining camps where a criminal gang incinerated at least 20 victims. In September, a police officer was killed in an ambush during an environmental patrol.
""It's out of control,"" said Freddy Vracko, a third-generation Yugoslav-Peruvian tree farmer.
Vracko's father was shot dead by masked men in his home in December 2015 after his family endured years of death threats from encroaching miners. That prompted Vracko to run for governor in this year's regional elections.
""I love that the Pope is coming. Just the fact that he'll be here ... it's going to be a tipping point,"" said Vracko. ""No one has really wanted to solve this problem.""
'HELL OF RICHES'
For Julio Cusurichi, head of a federation representing 36 indigenous communities, the illegal gold boom is only the latest sign of disdain that outsiders have shown for the Amazon and the tribes that rely on its water, plants and wildlife for survival.
Once enslaved and massacred by ruthless rubber barons in the 19th century, native peoples are now being forced off ancestral lands by mining mafias. Many suffer from dangerous levels of mercury in their blood.
""Indigenous people drink water from rivers because we don't have running water in our homes. We eat fish from rivers because we don't buy meat from the market,"" said Cusurichi, calling for the Peruvian state to defend its indigenous citizens.
The miners themselves, often young men fleeing poverty in Andean villages, also suffer in the makeshift mining pits they toil in clandestinely. Many girls and women lured with promises of steady work end up working in brothels, said Arbex.
""It's horrible. The working conditions. The sex trafficking,"" Arbex said, estimating that at least 250 miners die every year in mudslides or other unreported accidents. ""They prefer a hell of riches to a poor paradise.""
The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a U.S.-based non-profit group, said vilifying miners has kept authorities from addressing the poverty and state neglect that sustain the illegal gold trade.
The NRDC said it was launching a $45 million program this year to help tackle unregulated gold mining in Peru and other countries, through policies that encourage safer work practices.
But Arbex said it might be too late to reverse the trend. 

""I haven't lost faith in God but I have lost faith in policy,"" said Arbex.

1146,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Could Taliban finally return to Afghan peace talks? Obstacles abound,"By James Mackenzie and Hamid Shalizi
KABUL (Reuters) - Exploratory meetings in Pakistan between a high-level Taliban delegation and a representative of a prominent Afghan politician have fueled speculation of a revival of long-stalled talks on ending Afghanistan's 16-year war that kills thousands each year.
Similar hopes have repeatedly been dashed since the first direct talks between the Western-backed Afghan government and the Taliban broke down almost as soon as they began in the Pakistani hill station of Murree, outside Islamabad, in 2015.
But U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley's remarks this week that talks were closer than ever - coming after Monday's unofficial meeting in Islamabad - have renewed interest in a process that had seemed completely stalled.
A statement from the Russian foreign ministry on Wednesday called for urgent direct talks between the Taliban and the government, adding that Russia, which has maintained contacts with the insurgent movement, could host them.
""I think something is cooking,"" said Mohammad Ismail Qasimyar, a senior adviser to Afghanistan's High Peace Council, which was established to oversee the peace process. ""The situation around us in Afghanistan is developing in such a way that we need peace even more today than we did yesterday.""
Low-level contacts between the Afghan government, international groups including the UN and groups close to the Taliban have continued even as the insurgency has escalated over the past three years.
But progress has always been blocked by the deep mistrust between the government and the Taliban, as well as uncertainty about the position of neighbors including Pakistan, which Afghanistan has long accused of aiding the insurgents.
Pakistan rejects accusations that it sponsors the Taliban, pointing to the heavy casualty toll militant violence has inflicted on its citizens as well as the efforts it has made to fight radical groups on its territory.
Still, many in Afghanistan argue that Pakistan, which has come under heavy pressure from Washington, is simply encouraging hopes of progress in order to buy time.
One senior government official in Kabul, noted that speculation about peace talks regularly surfaces in the winter, while the Taliban regroups ahead of its spring offensive.
""None of these meetings or talks about talks will help achieve peace,"" he said.
Pakistan's foreign office spokesman Mohammad Faisal declined to comment on Afghan accusations that Pakistan may have pushed recent meetings to deflect U.S. pressure, but he added Islamabad was in favour of a political solution to the long war.
""A stable and prosperous Afghanistan is our aim, he said. ""And we would wish that we would arrive at the through negotiations, a talks-based process.""
""U.S. POLICY WORKING""
The UN Security Council is due to hold a debate on Afghanistan's future later on Friday following a visit to Kabul by council members this week, and is expected to call for a stronger regional partnership between Afghanistan and Central Asian neighbors.
It is the latest in a series of steps aimed at building agreement among Afghanistan's neighbors. 
Under a new strategy announced last year by U.S. President Donald Trump, the United States has stepped up its assistance to Afghan security forces, particularly through air strikes, with the aim of preventing any Taliban military victory and forcing the insurgents to accept peace talks.
""The U.S. policy in Afghanistan is working,"" Hayley told reporters. ""We're closer to talks with the Taliban and the peace process than we've seen before.""
The Taliban itself, which controls or disputes government control over more than a third of the country, says it wants a peaceful solution but says negotiations would depend on international troops leaving Afghanistan.
""Islamic Emirate has a clear agenda for peace in Afghanistan and that is the end of invasion and an overall Islamic regime,"" its spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement this week. 
According to sources in the Taliban and an Afghan political party, a delegation from the movement's political office in Qatar visited Islamabad for exploratory talks with Afghan politician Pir Hamid Gilani.
A senior Taliban official based near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border said on Friday that the insurgents were ""defining a new peace strategy"" after the Islamabad meeting, which he described as the ""most serious contacts since Murree"".
The movement's spokesman denied any involvement in a separate meeting in Turkey that included figures linked to a breakaway Taliban faction and a representative of Hizb-i Islami, a party led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a former Taliban ally who came over to the government side last year. 
Even if contacts are at no more than ""pre-negotiation"" stage, where the two sides try to establish the basis for talks, considerable obstacles remain.
The government in Kabul is deeply divided, with increasing hostility between rival ethnic and party groups that will make it difficult to establish a unified negotiating stance.

The Taliban has its own divisions and the ability of its leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada to command the affiliated Haqqani network, blamed for major attacks on civilian targets in cities such as Kabul, may be tested.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Tijuana native Alma Martinez will cast her first-ever vote for a Mexican president this July, but from across the country's northern border, where she is among hundreds of thousands of co-nationals whose participation could be decisive in a close race.
Seven times as many Mexicans in the United States have received voting credentials under new rules that let citizens sign up at local consulates rather than in Mexico, compared with the last presidential election six years ago.
Many are first time voters.
""It could potentially decide the election,"" said David Ayon, a senior fellow at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. 
Oregon resident Martinez, 39, who moved to the United States two decades ago and works as a hotel cleaner, said she was particularly motivated to cast her ballot because of the uncertainty for migrants under U.S. President Donald Trump.
""Things haven't gotten ugly with Trump just yet, but you never know if you'll be deported,"" she said. ""You always live with a part of your heart in Mexico.""
Mexico's National Electoral Institute (INE) says it has already approved more than 460,000 credentials for voters abroad, and is processing thousands more applications, ahead of a March 31 deadline to register.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a former mayor of Mexico City who now leads the leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), is the front-runner ahead of the vote, an opinion poll showed this week. [nL1N1PC0Q8]
Ricardo Anaya of the conservative National Action Party (PAN) was in second place. Jose Antonio Meade, who is seeking the nomination of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), came in third.
PRI PLAGUED BY SCANDALS
In a tight race, all votes could be crucial.
In 2006, former President Felipe Calderon won by fewer than 244,000 votes, or less than 1 percentage point, the first time that Mexicans could vote for president outside the country. 
In that race, INE counted 40,876 voters abroad, of which 80 percent voted, followed by 59,115 in the next election cycle, of which 70 percent voted.
This year's race is also shaping up to be hotly contested given the numerous corruption scandals plaguing the PRI, which has held power for most of the past nine decades.
""It's very early to say what percent of them will vote, but in a tight election, these votes could make a difference,"" said Benito Nacif, an INE official.
During the last two elections, Mexican voters based in the United States largely favored the PAN, followed by Lopez Obrador, who is now making his third presidential bid. Last year, he drew crowds as he visited major U.S. cities on what he described as a tour to support ""our countrymen, the migrants.""
Adrian Felix, a University of California Santa Cruz professor, said he expects more U.S. votes to be cast than in previous elections. But he said the multi-step registration process, plus skepticism, could limit the increase among the estimated 12 million Mexicans living abroad.
""There are a number of institutional impediments that need to be changed to democratize the process,"" he said.
Most Mexican political parties have been staying quiet in the United States, restricted from campaigning abroad under INE rules although news and social media flow across borders. 
Some Mexican politicians are recognizing the burgeoning influence of voters far from home. 
""Mexicans in the United States could directly influence the result in this election,"" said Enrique Alfaro, a former mayor of Guadalajara who is running for governor in Jalisco state. ""I'm seeing a lot of spirit among the community from Jalisco in various U.S. cities."" 
Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, said the impact from Mexico's diaspora in the United States could be greater in future elections if politicians seize on growing participation. 

""At some point there will be a candidate that wants to take advantage of the vote abroad, and that will be a game changer,"" he said.

While the Baghdad government last month declared victory over Islamic State after wresting back almost all the territory IS seized in 2014, persistent bombing and shooting attacks make it difficult to rebuild the lives of displaced people, according to UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency. 
""We believe that as a result of the conflict, a lack of investment over the years, and the poverty ... that there are 4 million children now in need across Iraq,"" said Peter Hawkins, UNICEF chief representative in the country.
He told a Geneva news briefing by telephone from Baghdad that 1.3 million of the 2.6 million displaced by the often devastating fighting with Islamic State were children.
""While the fighting has come to an end in several areas, spikes of violence continue in others - just this week, three bombings went off in Baghdad,"" UNICEF Regional Director Geert Cappelaere said in a statement.
""Violence is not only killing and maiming children; it is destroying schools, hospitals, homes and roads. It is tearing apart the diverse social fabric and the culture of tolerance that hold communities together.""Hawkins said UNICEF was also helping children of alleged IS militants now in detention by providing comfort and legal aid, and is trying to reunite those separated from their families, including those abroad. 
The issue of civilians uprooted from Sunni Muslim areas previously under control of Sunni IS jihadists has become the latest bone of sectarian-tinged political contention in Iraq.
Sunni politicians are lobbying for postponing parliamentary elections due in May to allow the displaced to return to their hometowns to cast their ballots there. 
Shi'ite Muslim politicians including Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi insist on the vote taking place as planned on May 12.
The United States called on Thursday for the elections to be held on time, saying that delaying them ""set a dangerous precedent, undermining the constitution and damaging Iraq’s long-term democratic development"".

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 08:11AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Rohingya refugee leaders draw up demands ahead of repatriation,"By Zeba Siddiqui
KUTUPALONG, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Rohingya leaders in a Bangladesh refugee camp have drawn up a list of demands they want Myanmar to meet before authorities begin sending back hundreds of thousands in a repatriation process expected to begin next week and last for two years. 
The petition is the latest indication of the challenges ahead for Bangladesh and Myanmar as they try to engineer the return of refugees who fear continued military operations in Rakhine State and are dismayed about the prospect of a prolonged stay in ""temporary camps"" in Myanmar when they go back. 
A half-dozen Rohingya elders, saying they represented 40 villages from Rakhine, showed the list of demands to a Reuters reporter at the Kutupalong refugee camp, where most of the 655,500 Rohingya refugees are staying.
The petition, handwritten in Burmese, said none of the Muslim Rohingya would return to mainly Buddhist Myanmar unless the demands were met. 
The petition, which has still to be finalised, demanded the Myanmar government publicly announce it is giving Rohingya long-denied citizenship and inclusion on a list of the country's recognized ethnic groups. It asks that land once occupied by the refugees be returned to them and their homes, mosques and schools rebuilt.
It wants the military held accountable for alleged killings, looting and rape, and the release from jails of ""innocent Rohingya"" picked up in counter-insurgency operations.
It also wants Myanmar to stop listing people with their photographs as ""terrorists"" in state media and on government Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) pages. 
Myanmar state newspapers this week issued a supplement listing the names and photos of alleged members of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), whose attacks on security posts on Aug. 25 triggered a sweeping counter-insurgency operation.
The United Nations has described the Myanmar military operations in the northern part of Rakhine as a classic case of ethnic cleansing. 
The military says it has only conducted legitimate operations and denies there have been cases of sexual assault.
But the military said last week soldiers had killed 10 captured Muslim “terrorists” during insurgent attacks at the beginning of September, after Buddhist villagers had forced the captured men into a grave the villagers had dug.
It was a rare acknowledgment of wrongdoing by the Myanmar military during its operations in the western state of Rakhine. 
ARSA said in a statement last week the 10 Rohingya in the mass grave were ""innocent civilians"" and not members of their group. 
CHALLENGES AHEAD
The Rohingya elders Reuters spoke to said they were still finalising their list of demands before showing it to Bangladesh authorities and to aid agencies administering the camps.
They said the 40 village leaders they discussed the petition with represent the interests of all Rohingya at the camp, but that could not be independently verified and aid agencies were unable to comment pending formal issuance of the petition.
Bangladesh and Myanmar this week agreed to complete the return of the refugees over the next two years, with the process due to begin on Tuesday.
But even as preparations get underway for the repatriation, Rohingya Muslims continue to pour into Bangladesh.
More than 100 Rohingya have crossed into Bangladesh from Myanmar since Wednesday and scores more were waiting to cross the Naf river that forms the border, newly arrived refugees in Bangladesh told Reuters.
The new arrivals said they fled Myanmar because of military operations in their village of Sein Yin Pyin, and gave accounts of young men being rounded up and of discovering dead bodies in a pond and a forest. 
They said they fled out of hunger, after hiding in their homes for days, unable to go to work in the fields and forests that provided their livelihood.
Myanmar Police Colonel Myo Thu Soe, spokesman for the military-controlled Home Affairs Ministry, told Reuters on Thursday ""there's no clearance operation going on in the villages"".
But, he added, ""security forces are still trying to take control of the area"" in northern Rakhine. He declined to elaborate. 
Rights groups and the UN say any repatriations must be voluntary.
Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human RightsWatch, told Reuters in an email authorities cannot deal with the Rohingya refugees ""as if they are an inert mass of people who will go where and when they are told"". 
The repatriation deal does not cover over 200,000 other Rohingya refugees living in Bangladesh prior to October 2016, who had been driven out of Myanmar during previous episodes of ethnic violence and military operations.

South Sudan, which split off from its northern neighbor Sudan in 2011, has been gripped by a four-year civil war sparked by political rivalry between incumbent leader Salva Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar. 
In an interview with Reuters on Friday, Henrietta H. Fore, UNICEF's executive director, made the warning after visiting some of the areas most devastated by the war. 
""70 percent of the children are out of school, that is highest in the world. There is too much violence."" he said.
“If we don’t help... we are going to lose this generation and that would be tragic for South Sudan because a country cannot build itself without this next generation of young people.""
Fore said she had visited towns in the country's north and witnessed widespread malnutrition among children and warned: ""We are heading into the dry season... we might lose up to quarter million children in South Sudan."" 
An estimated tens of thousands have died in the conflict which has also displaced a quarter of the country's population of 12 million. 
The country's economy, nearly entirely dependant on oil exports, has been left in tatters as output has been cut.
Agricultural production, too, has declined as insecurity has left some times entire villages abandoned and gardens unattended. 
A ceasefire deal was signed in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa last month to halt the fighting but it has been violated repeatedly with both sides blaming each other. 
Attacks have also been directed at humanitarian workers, complicating delivery of relief services on which hundreds of thousands of the displaced depend.

David Ali Sonboly, 18, killed nine people in Munich in 2016 before shooting himself dead. Another 27 people were injured. Police concluded the German-born Sonboly was a lone gunman obsessed with mass killings and was not inspired by Islamist militancy.
The Munich public prosecutor's office had charged the accused man with nine counts of negligent homicide, five counts of negligently causing grievous bodily harm and selling weapons illegally. 
Public prosecutors had called for the man - identified only as Philipp K., as is customary under German law - to be sentenced to seven years and two months in prison. His lawyers had sought three and a half years.
Authorities arrested the man in Marburg, about 100 km (65 miles) north of Frankfurt in 2016, after contacting him on the so-called ""dark net"" and posing as buyers for an automatic weapon and a Glock 17 pistol for 8,000 euros ($9,806).
During a sting operation, the suspected arms dealer said he had sold the 18-year-old Iranian-German another Glock 17 pistol during a meeting in Marburg, followed by 350 rounds of ammunition during a second meeting.
A spokeswoman for the public prosecutor had said in August that evidence heard during the trial had shown that the suspect had far-right attitudes.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's delegation to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos next week will be led by state minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, who was released from detention related to an anti-corruption purge in November, Saudi sources said.
Assaf, who was also a former finance minister and a board member of national oil company Saudi Aramco, was among people detained and under investigation by a new anti-corruption body, a senior Saudi official had told Reuters.
After he was seen attending a cabinet meeting earlier this month, a Saudi source said he had been cleared of wrongdoing and retained his positions as minister of state and adviser to the king.
Saudi security forces have rounded up dozens of princes, ministers and business leaders and converted the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh into a luxurious prison in what the authorities said was a crackdown on corruption.
The move was also widely seen as helping Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman consolidate his grip on power after he ousted his cousin as heir to the throne in the summer.
Some detainees have cut deals with the government, handing over cash or assets in exchange for their freedom.
Assaf's restoration appears to suggest that influential figures might keep their positions if they cooperate with the investigations.
The government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

1156,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Merkel and Macron look to turn warm ties into reform goals,"By Luke Baker
PARIS (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron will spend more than five hours together in Paris on Friday, putting on a show of Franco-German unity as they try to agree on reforms to the euro zone. 
At an EU summit in Brussels last month, the two said they hoped to come up with shared reform proposals by March, with Macron having pushed the idea of a standalone budget and a single finance minister for the currency bloc.
Merkel's efforts to form a coalition government in Germany have held back discussions with France, but the expectation she will manage to clinch another grand coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats has lent new impetus to the euro zone debate.
France and Germany, which account for 50 percent of euro zone output, are essential to the reform drive. Without agreement between them, any ambition to upgrade Europe's economic and monetary union and help the bloc withstand future crises is unlikely to get off the ground.
With the European Parliament holding elections next year, and Britain's exit from the European Union looming, 2018 is seen as the critical time to push through reforms.
Yet while Macron and Merkel have met and spoken by phone repeatedly in recent weeks, and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire held talks with his German counterpart Peter Altmaier in Paris on Thursday, there appears to be some way still to go before a common position on the core issues can be reached. 
Speaking after his meeting with Altmaier, Le Maire hinted that it may be beyond March before agreement is found. 
""We have ... an immediate priority, which is the completion of the banking union, the completion of the capital markets union and tax convergence with Germany,"" Le Maire said. 
""On these three issues, our goal is to reach a final joint position between March and June.""
NEW REFORMS OR OLD REFORMS?
When it comes to euro zone reform, while Germany and France often put on a strong show of political unity and shared intent, the devil is always in the detail. 
Macron, elected in May on an avowedly pro-Europe platform, has set out grand plans, including suggesting at one point that the zone should have its own budget worth hundreds of billions of euros, an idea that does not sit well with Germany.
Talk of some sort of budget or separate allocation for the 19-country bloc remains, but its size - if it is ever agreed - is likely to be much smaller and it remains unclear how it would be established and how it would be deployed.
The idea of a single finance minister now appears to be a discussion for the future, and the suggestion that the euro zone's 500-billion-euro ESM rescue fund be turned into a European Monetary Fund to stabilize member states facing economic shocks still needs to be fleshed out.
Instead, discussions are focused on completing reforms that have already been agreed but not fully implemented, such as banking union, which aims to establish unified supervision and resolution rules across the euro area, and a capital markets union, which would do something similar for capital markets.
On banking union, Germany still has concerns about how risks will be shared. Progress has been made on supervision, which now falls under the European Central Bank, but the bloc has not yet agreed a mechanism for winding down troubled banks or a single deposit insurance scheme.

In that respect, the Merkel-Macron reform push may be as much about completing existing reforms as tackling new ones, which euro zone analysts still believe are necessary.

1157,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","No reason why I can't rule Catalonia remotely, former leader says","By Sonya Dowsett and Inmaculada Sanz
MADRID (Reuters) - The sacked former leader of Catalonia said on Friday he was perfectly eligible to be re-elected as regional president and there was no reason why he couldn't rule the Spanish region remotely from self-imposed exile in Brussels.
Supporters of Carles Puigdemont, who faces arrest for charges including sedition and rebellion if he returns to Spain, have suggested he could rule via video link -- earning him the sobriquet 'the hologram president' from detractors.
""I am a member of parliament who is perfectly eligible as president,"" Puigdemont told Catalunya Radio. ""These days many big projects are handled with the use of new technologies.""
Referring to the charges against him, he added: ""You can't rule from prison.""
Puigdemont's administration was dismissed by the central government in Madrid after he spearheaded a drive for the wealthy northeastern region to split from Spain that culminated in an October declaration of independence.
He regained his seat in the Catalan parliament in a Dec. 21 election that was called by Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in the hope that pro-unity parties would win and resolve Spain's worst political crisis in decades. That ploy backfired, with parties in favor of a split gaining a slim majority. 
Puigdemont moved to Brussels shortly after he was fired by Madrid but has said he would return to Catalonia if the Spanish government gave him certain ""guarantees"", probably a promise not to arrest him.
Other Catalan independence leaders including Oriol Junqueras, leader of the second-biggest separatist party in the regional parliament, are serving custodial sentences in Madrid for their roles in planning a banned independence referendum. 
Uncertainty over the future of the region, which hosts Spain's second-biggest city Barcelona and world-class factories for global brands like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Nestle, spooked investors and led to thousands of companies moving their registered headquarters elsewhere in Spain.
The Catalan parliamentary committee, which has a pro-independence majority, must decide by Jan. 31 if it will allow presidential candidates to present remotely. Madrid has said it will contest any such decision in the courts. 
Puigdemont would not clarify in Friday's radio interview whether he would continue with plans to unilaterally construct an independent republic if elected regional president. But he said he planned to restore the previous administration.

""There is no plan B: plan A is restoration because that is what the people have entrusted us with.""

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - France on Friday politely rejected Boris Johnson's idea of building a giant bridge across the English Channel after Brexit, saying that, while far-fetched ideas were worth considering, there were plenty of major European projects to finish first.
Foreign Secretary Johnson, who led the campaign to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum, broached the idea of building a 22-mile Channel Bridge during a visit to Britain by French President Emmanuel Macron, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported.
Britain's most prominent Brexiteer even explained some of his ideas on Channel crossings to Macron, who the newspaper reported gave a short but positive reply.
France's finance minister, though, gave the idea short shrift.
""All ideas merit consideration, even the most far-fetched ones,"" Bruno Le Maire said, noting that the Channel Tunnel already linked Europe's second- and third-largest economies.
""We have major European infrastructure projects that are complicated to finance,"" Le Maire told Europe 1 radio. ""Let's finish things that already under way before thinking of new ones.""
Prime Minister Theresa May’s appointment of Johnson, who in the run-up to Britain’s referendum on EU membership compared the goals of the European Union to those of Adolf Hitler and Napoleon, caused consternation in European capitals.
It took two centuries for Britain to countenance the construction of the Channel Tunnel, which French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte once suggested, though the land link has repeatedly been the focus of concerns about illegal immigration.
""Our economic success depends on good infrastructure and good connections. Should the Channel Tunnel be just a first step?"" Johnson tweeted. 
BREXIT BRIDGE 
Johnson did not mention the idea of a bridge explicitly in public and it was unclear if any detailed discussions had taken place.
The Telegraph said Johnson believed a privately funded 22-mile bridge might now be an option, and would support increased tourism and trade after Brexit.
""Technology is moving on all the time and there are much longer bridges elsewhere,"" Johnson told his aides, according to the newspaper.
It was unclear how such a bridge might work in one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, or whether its construction might interrupt trade.
""It’s good to have vision, particularly with respect to infrastructure projects, but the Dover Strait is the world’s busiest shipping lane with many, many hundreds of vessel transits per day,"" said Guy Platten, CEO of the UK Chamber of Shipping. 
""Building a 22-mile-long bridge across the Channel would therefore not be without its challenges, especially as the largest ships currently transiting the Strait have a height above the water line in excess of 60 meters.""
As foreign minister, Johnson has bewildered British and foreign diplomats alike with sometimes flippant remarks on issues ranging from Libyan tourism to British colonialism in Burma.
While mayor of London, he backed a now-defunct plan for a 200 million pound ($280 million) pedestrian ""Garden Bridge"" over the Thames, which he hoped would create a new green space in the middle of the city.

He also argued vociferously for a new airport to be built on an island in the Thames Estuary as a solution to the capital's air capacity problems, a plan rejected by the government.

Some 22,900 people were detected as they reached Spain via Morocco or Algeria last year, up from 10,231 in 2016, a steep increase that is boosted by migration from these two northern African countries.
Frontex border agency director Fabrice Leggeri said that while arrivals in Italy and Greece via Libya have dropped, total numbers using those routes remain above those to Spain and there are no signs of any major shift. 
""Economic migrants don't want to end up in a country (Libya) where there are clashes between armed groups ... there are individual cases considering finding an alternative route,"" Leggeri told Reuters.
""But the (small) numbers do not make it possible to say there is a displacement,"" he said. 
The EU's border agency was closely monitoring whether there was any shift, he said, by looking at countries such as Niger where migrants could be choosing to go either via Libya to Italy or north or west Africa to Spain. 
Problems in Morocco's northern Rif region, together with the improvement of Spain's economic situation have played a role in the increased arrival of illegal migrants to the Iberian peninsular, but there are also sub-Saharan Africans crossing there, Leggeri earlier told a news conference.
Nearly 40 percent of migrants intercepted while crossing by sea to Spain were Algerian and Moroccan nationals, according to Frontex data.
""The flows arriving from Maghreb countries to Spain are very likely to increase (in 2018),"" Leggeri said, adding that speed boats, also related to drug trafficking, were being used to move migrants.

Frontex was finalising plans to make a border operation in the west Mediterranean, that so far only worked in the summer, permanent, with increased use of air surveillance, he said.

Moise Lida Kouassi, who once served as Gbagbo's defense minister, was arrested in Togo in 2012 for his role in a planned military coup against Ouattara, who beat Gbagbo in a U.N.-certified election in 2010. 
Gbagbo refused to step down after the election, dragging Ivory Coast into a brief civil war that ended when he was defeated by pro-Ouattara forces backed by French and U.N. troops. Gbagbo is now on trial at the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. 
Details of the plan to reinstate Gbagbo in a coup were found on Kouassi's computer hard drive after his arrest. At the time, Kouassi said he wanted to ask for Ouattara's forgiveness.
Kouassi's lawyer Felix Bobre said his client would appeal against the decision. He said Kouassi was being targeted just because of his association with the disgraced ex-president.

The arguably more important party constitution was amended at the once-in-five-years 19th Party Congress in October to include Xi's political thought.
The party unanimously passed an amendment then to add ""Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era"" as one of its guiding principles.
Following a two-day meeting of top officials in Beijing, the party has now proposed writing the same theory into the state constitution, state news agency Xinhua said.
The communique said Xi's thought had generated a national ""fervor"" which had helped provide ""great spiritual impetus"" in the implementation of 19th Party Congress's strategic policies.
The meeting also stressed that a ""centralized, unified, authoritative and highly effective"" national supervision system should be set up to fight corruption throughout the state bureaucracy, Xinhua said.
Chinese legal scholars have said the country needs to amend its constitution before it can set up the new supervision commission to ensure there is a proper constitutional basis for its powers.
Xinhua however did not explicitly say what might be amended when it came to the supervision commission.
Fighting deeply ingrained graft had been a key policy plank for Xi in his first term in office and that battle will take on a new hue with the setting up of the National Supervision Commission as he begins his second term.
Trial work has already begun for that commission, which is likely to be formally codified in law in March at a meeting of China's largely rubber stamp parliament.
Because the state constitution is being amended, it needs parliament to formally approve it, probably at the March session, though it could happen before. Xinhua did not say exactly when it would happen.
Whether Xi was able to have his name ""crowned"" in the party constitution had been seen as a key measure of his power, elevating him to a level of previous leaders exemplified by Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.
No other leader since Mao has had an eponymous ideology included in the document while in office. Deng's name was added after his death in 1997.
The state constitution was last amended in 2004 to include guarantees to protect private property and human rights.

While it theoretically offers broad guarantees to things like freedom of speech, religion and association, rights groups say in practice these are ignored. It also highlights the primacy of the Communist Party in leading China.

Al Shabaab said government forces, accompanied by drones, had attacked the school in Middle Shabelle region. It said four children and a teacher were killed.
No comment was immediately available from the Somali government on the reports of casualties or the use of drones. 
""They kidnapped the rest of the students,"" said Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab's military spokesman.
""Human Rights Watch is responsible for the deaths of the students and their teacher because it pointed fingers at them,"" he added. 
In a report this week, the New York-based rights group said that since September 2017, al Shabaab had ordered village elders, teachers in Islamic religious schools, and rural communities to hand over hundreds of children as young as eight.
The al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militia is fighting to topple the U.N.-backed Somali government and establish its own rule based on a strict interpretation of Islam's sharia law.
Somalia has been plagued by conflict since the early 1990s, when clan-based warlords overthrew authoritarian ruler Mohamed Siad Barre then turned on each other. 
In recent years, regional administrations headed by the Mogadishu-based federal government have emerged, and African Union peacekeepers supporting Somali troops have gradually clawed back territory from the Islamist insurgents.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban actress Aniet Hernandez lost all hope that she and her two children would ever join her husband in Miami when the Trump administration slashed staffing at the U.S. embassy in Havana in September and stopped almost all visa processing.
""When I heard the news, I thought my marriage was over, that my family was being destroyed,"" said the 35-year old, whose husband emigrated four years ago to seek ""a better future"". 
A few weeks after its announcement, the United States said it would process Cuban family reunification requests at its Bogota embassy instead, sparking both relief and frustration on the Communist-run island.
Bogota, the capital of Colombia, is an approximate three hour flight from Havana, and Colombia requires Cuban visitors to obtain visas.
So Hernandez is now one of hundreds of Cubans seeking visas at the Colombian embassy in Havana in order to fly to Bogota for two to three weeks for interviews at the U.S. embassy - an extra layer of cost and bureaucracy in an already complex affair.
""This whole process is quite stressful,"" said Hernandez.
The once-quiet villa that houses the Colombian embassy in the plush Miramar suburb of Havana is a hub of activity as Cubans line up outside from dawn until dusk, sheltering from the sun and rain under umbrellas and trees.
Colombian consul Luis Fernando Cordoba said his team was working much longer hours than usual and getting back-up to cope with higher demand for visas.
""These are people who have spent two to three years without their families so we want to give them support,"" Cordoba said. ""It's a delicate situation.""
Given the average state wage in Cuba is $30 per month, those waiting outside the embassy said the requirement of at least $2,000 in a bank account for the Colombian visa was onerous.
Their families in the United States had lent them that money as well as shouldered other costs, they said.
Those included around $170 for the Colombian visa, plus flights to Bogota and multi-week hotel stay, with the risk it might all be a waste of time if the United States denied them immigrant status.
""It's a whole lot of money to spend, about $4,000 in total to be reunited with my family,"" said Mercedes Cespedes, 78, who has been waiting for a year and half to join her brother in Michigan. ""This is pretty abusive because political situations shouldn't interfere in Cuban families.""
DETERIORATING RELATIONSHIP 
The Cuban-U.S. relationship, which former Democrat U.S. President Barack Obama had sought to normalize after decades of Cold War conflict, has steadily deteriorated since Republican Donald Trump took office, impacting families divided by the Florida Straits.
While Cuba's population numbers around 11 million, there are an estimated 2 million Cubans or Americans of Cuban origin in the United States.
The United States has a deal with Cuba to issue 20,000 U.S. visas a year to Cubans seeking to emigrate, agreed after a 1994 rafter exodus to prevent them from taking to the sea illegally in makeshift craft.
Washington issued more than 800 immigrant visas to Cubans per month from March to August last year, State Department data shows, but just 168 in September, 16 in October and 196 in November in the wake of the scaling back of its Havana embassy.
The Trump administration said it had no choice but to reduce staffing, given it believed two dozen of its diplomats and family members in Havana had been sickened in a mysterious spate of attacks. 
A U.S. official told Reuters last week the government will not send staff back yet.
Critics say Washington politicized a complicated matter. Canada reported similar health problems among its staff in Havana but, given the lack of evidence about the cause, has not shrunk its embassy.
Cordoba said Colombia was doing all it could to help Cuban families and has not rejected a single visa request from Cubans to travel to Bogota for interviews at the U.S. embassy.
In the line of applicants, Delio Sotolongo said he had come from the central province of Villa Clara, 250 km (155 miles) away. Given his monthly salary of $15 as an accountant, his wife in Miami was paying all the fees.
""We need to be optimistic now,"" the 50-year old said, ""and think that we will finally manage to join our families again.""

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan leader Yoweri Museveni may resume signing off on death sentences after a long hiatus to help stem a wave of crime, he said on Twitter in comments that were quickly denounced by rights activists opposed to capital punishment.
Death remains the maximum sentence in Uganda for a range of crimes including murder, treason and defilement, but no executions have taken place since 1999. A prisons service spokesman said there are currently 278 inmates on death row. 
In a tweet on Thursday Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, said he had been reluctant to sign off on death sentences because of his ""Christian background"".
""But being lenient is causing people to think they can cause harm and get away with it. I will revise my position,"" he said.
Ugandans have complained of a surge in crime in recent years, especially around the capital Kampala in central Uganda.
A series of gruesome but still unsolved murders last year of women whose bodies were dumped on roadsides in a wide area south of Kampala was widely covered in the media, as were machete attacks at New Year that killed five people in rural locations.
Government critics often accuse Uganda's police of directing their efforts at pursuing Museveni's political opponents rather than fighting crime, for which conviction rates are low.
Museveni, 73, is set to run for another term as president in 2021 after parliament last month scrapped a constitutional age limit of 75 years. The opposition and other critics say that amendment effectively allows him to rule for life. 
Nicholas Opiyo of rights organization Chapter Four said he felt Museveni was unlikely to resume assenting to executions, and described his tweet as ""political talk"" to divert attention from the constitutional amendment, which fueled public anger. 

""The death penalty is not reformative, it's revenge killing by the state ... the death penalty is not a deterrent,"" Opiyo said.

Five students and one teacher were injured in the attack, the committee said. The attacker was detained and was now hospitalized after a suicide attempt, the committee said.

1171,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>","Serbia on course for EU by 2025, top EU official says","By Robin Emmott
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Serbia and Montenegro are likely be the next countries to join the European Union, possibly by 2025, the bloc's official in charge of membership bids said in an interview.
The European Union is launching a diplomatic effort to accelerate steps to bring six countries in the Western Balkans into the EU fold after years of stop-start progress.
""It is time to finish the work of 1989,"" European Commissioner Johannes Hahn told Reuters, referring to the EU's eastward expansion after the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
""We have set 2025 as an indicative date for Serbia and Montenegro, which is realistic but also very ambitious.""
Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia all hope to join the European Union but have seen their membership chances fade in recent years as the bloc's politicians, faced with rising eurosceptism at home, the 2009-2013 eurozone crisis and Britain's vote to leave the bloc, appeared to lose interest. 
But rising Russian influence, a migration crisis that straddles the region, Turkey's drift toward authoritarian rule and a desire to strengthen European integration after Britain leaves in 2019 have presented the Balkans with an opportunity.
""Either we export stability to the region or we import instability,"" Hahn said, arguing that the EU's accession process was the best way to fight corruption, organized crime and the threat of authoritarianism in the region.
Serbia is seen as the lynchpin and the EU hopes Belgrade's influence in the Balkans could help others reform.
Hahn is set to visit Serbia in February after publishing the Commission's official Balkan strategy on Feb. 6, followed by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who is expected to visit all six countries in a gesture of support. 
Hahn will also travel to Washington next month to meet U.S. State Department officials to outline the EU's Balkan push.
With neighboring Bulgaria holding the EU's rotating presidency from January to June, European Union leaders will hold a special Balkan summit in Sofia in May. Britain is also set to host another top-level Balkan gathering in July.
""WAKE-UP CALL""
In another sign of momentum, Macedonia could be offered an invitation to join the U.S.-led NATO military alliance if it can resolve a dispute with Greece over the former Yugoslav republic's name, NATO diplomats say.
Hahn said he was confident the issue could eventually be resolved following United Nations talks this month. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, in a visit to Macedonia on Wednesday, also said he saw hope for resolving the name issue.
Obstacles to meeting EU membership terms abound, however. 
The six Balkan countries' banking systems and judiciaries are weak, and incomes in the region are 30 percent of those in the euro zone, according to the International Monetary Fund.
The region is scarred by the ethnic conflicts that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
Bosnia remains deeply divided. Serbia does not recognize the independence of Kosovo, its former province, and accuses it of seeking war with Belgrade. Montenegro was mired in political crisis for much of 2017.
The EU's strategy rests on Serbia and Kosovo reaching a ""normalization of relations"" by the end of 2019, according to a draft version of the bloc's Balkan plan seen by Reuters.
Hahn conceded that the killing of Kosovo Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic on Tuesday showed the instability of the region.

""I hope this is a wake-up call to responsible politicians. I ask for statesmanship to understand that only cooperation, reconciliation is the only way forward,"" he said.

1172,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 04:18AM ET</span>","Taiwan stymies new China flights amid route row, official says","TAIPEI/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Taiwan's aviation regulator has stalled applications for new flights from China Eastern Airlines and Xiamen Airlines amid a row between Beijing and the self-ruled island over air routes, a regulatory official said on Friday.
Taiwan had not yet approved the applications to add flights during the approaching Lunar New Year holiday because in recent weeks the airlines had used four disputed air routes close to the island, said the official, who asked not to be identified.
This month China opened several disputed air routes, including a northbound M503 route in the Taiwan Strait, without informing Taiwan, contravening what the democratic government in Taipei said was a 2015 deal to first discuss such flight paths.
Taiwan has expressed concern the new routes are too close to existing routes that link it to airports on two groups of Taiwan-controlled islands lying close to China, and are a threat to flight safety. 
China has denied safety could be affected, saying it had no need of Taiwan's approval for new routes.
China Eastern Airlines had applied to add 106 flights while Xiamen Airlines, majority-owned by China Southern Airlines, had applied for 70, the official said.
The applications were ""still under review"", he added. 
More than 10,000 customers have made bookings for the yet-to-be approved flights, Xiamen Airlines said in an emailed statement that strongly urged Taiwan authorities to comply with popular demand.
""While the economic losses caused by these actions to the airlines are small, it will cause much inconvenience to people who want to travel,"" it said. 
China Eastern Airlines declined to comment.
China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment. 
The M503 route has yet to be confirmed by both sides, meaning that potential safety concerns remain, Ho Shu-ping, the deputy director general of Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration said on Friday, according to Taiwan media. 
Taiwan had asked airlines not to use the route for the time being, but some airlines were still doing so, she added.
The administration has not received a response from China about its concerns, Ho said, adding, ""On aviation safety there can be no compromise.""
The Chinese aviation regulator has previously said the new routes, meant to disperse airspace congestion, would only be used by civilian flights. 
China considers Taiwan a wayward province, and snapped official communications after the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party won power in 2016.

It suspects Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen wants to push for formal independence, though she has said she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to ensuring peace.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Lucas Mangope, a leader of one of South Africa's tribal homelands who resisted the end of apartheid, died on Thursday at the age of 94, local media reported on Friday.
Mangope was president from 1977 to 1994 of Bophuthatswana, one of South Africa's ""self-governing"" homelands, or bantustans - fragmented islands of rural poverty where most black South Africans were literally confined under white rule.
During the often-tense negotiations that paved the way to majority rule in 1994, Mangope maintained that Bophuthatswana would remain independent. He was ousted in a coup weeks before the elections that brought Nelson Mandela to power.
""I spoke to him (Mangope) on a number of occasions urging him to let his people decide, but he would not listen,"" Mandela wrote in his autobiography ""Long Walk to Freedom.""
The ruling African National Congress extended its condolences on his passing while noting in a statement that Mangope was ""an outspoken opponent of the democratization project in South Africa."" 
Mangope invited investors to Bophuthatswana and the gambling resort Sun City - a flashpoint for anti-apartheid protests - was established there, skirting the ban on casinos imposed by the socially conservative National Party in South Africa.
Tribal leaders still hold away in the former homelands, exercising what critics say is almost feudal control over impoverished rural populations. 
Much of Bophuthatswana and other homelands lie over the world's richest platinum reserves, and producers of the precious metal have had to strike deals with tribal leaders, which have often come unstuck, threatening production. 
Under apartheid, Pretoria maintained the fiction that the homelands were independent states as justification for denying black South Africans the vote, while the mining and other industries used them as sources of cheap, migrant labor.

Russian state television showed Putin marching onto the ice of frozen Lake Seliger, about 400 km (250 miles) north of Moscow, dressed in a sheepskin coat and felt boots.
With his coat and boots removed, he then walked down a set of wooden steps into a hole in the ice, crossed himself, and dipped his head under the water before surfacing. 
Air temperatures at the time were around six degrees Celsius below zero (21 degrees Fahrenheit). 
Each year on Epiphany, Orthodox believers immerse themselves in rivers and lakes to commemorate the baptism of Jesus Christ in the River Jordan. 
Putin, who is campaigning for re-election in a March 18 presidential election, grew up under Communist rule where open shows of religion were frowned upon. As president, he has become a frequent attender of Russian Orthodox ceremonies, and has given the church a major voice in society.
The Russian leader, who is 65, has a track record of stripping to the waist in public to reveal his torso.

In August last year he was photographed with his shirt off catching fish in a mountain lake in Siberia and in August 2009, a bare-chested Putin was pictured riding a horse during a Siberian holiday.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey would reject any offer of partnership with the European Union that falls short of membership, Ankara's minister for EU affairs said, warning that the current situation gave Turkey no reason to maintain its migrant deal with the bloc.
""A privileged partnership or similar approaches, we don't take any of these seriously. Turkey cannot be offered such a thing,"" Omer Celik told Reuters in an interview.
""Whatever it would be called, a privileged partnership or cooperation against terrorism, such an offer will not even be considered by Turkey,"" he added.
France's President Emmanuel Macron said two weeks ago that developments in Turkey did not allow for progress in its decades-long push to join the European Union. He said discussions should change focus, mentioning the possibility of a partnership that would fall short of full membership.
The EU has expressed concern over Turkey's crackdown on suspected supporters of a failed 2016 coup. Around 50,000 people have been arrested pending trial and 150,000, including teachers, journalists and judges, sacked or suspended from work.
Celik said the European Union was not honoring all parts of a deal to stem the flow of migrants westwards from Turkey in return for 3 billion euros in financial aid to Turkey and other support.
The financial aid was ""not working well"", no new chapters had been opened in Turkey's EU accession efforts and there had been no development on expanding a Turkish-EU customs deal.

""Technically there's no reason for Turkey to maintain this deal,"" Celik said.

President Rodrigo Duterte is furious at media reports that his longtime special assistant, Christopher ""Bong"" Go, had intervened to help a South Korean sub-contractor win the right to install a combat management system on the two missile-capable vessels, which are due for delivery in 2020.
Go has denied any wrongdoing.
The frigate issue cost former navy chief Vice Admiral Ronald Joseph Mercado his job last month. Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said Mercado was sacked because he kept insisting those ships be installed with combat systems made by a Dutch company.
Mercado and Lorenzana have both said Go had not intervened.
But opposition senators want an inquiry to establish whether or not there were violations of the government's procurement laws and if the president aides had intervened in what they said was the first military procurement of the Duterte administration.
The resolution was filed on Tuesday and asks two senate panels to look into the August 2016 contract, part of the military's five-year 125 billion peso ($2.46 billion) modernization program.
The Philippine Daily Inquirer newspaper and news site Rappler uploaded on their websites what they said were leaked copies of a document originating from the Office of the President, which asked the navy to look at the South Korean contractor's proposal.
Reuters cannot independently verify the authenticity of the document.
Lorenzana, however, said he gave the document to the former navy commander a year ago but was unsure whether the papers came from Go and if Go personally handed him the South Korean contractor's proposal.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea may be preparing to hold a military parade on the eve of next month's winter Olympics in South Korea, analysts and diplomats say, even as the two countries have sought to mend ties.
The North's continued development of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions has spurred more sanctions and talk of possible military strikes by U. S. officials.
Western diplomats in Pyongyang have said some international defense officials received invitations to a 70th anniversary commemoration of the Korean People’s Army on Feb 8.
Recent commercial satellite imagery shows formations of North Korean troops marching at a parade training ground, said Scott LaFoy, an analyst with the website NK Pro, which monitors North Korea.
""The parade appears to involve 28 formations of infantry or other military personnel, a traditional military band, and possibly additional personnel,"" LaFoy wrote in an analysis of the satellite imagery.
Some military vehicles could also be involved, he added.
If North Korea conducts a large military demonstration on February 8, it would come a day before the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea.
That event will see athletes from the two sides march under a single flag, in a demonstration of unity after kicking off official talks for the first time in two years in January.
A display of military might by Pyongyang could threaten that fragile detente.
The Mirim Parade Training Ground, where the formations were spotted, is typically only very active before parades, which in past years have been used to showcase the North's growing missile arsenal, LaFoy said. 
The planned parade appears to be smaller than last year's massive display, and imagery shows no evidence of large vehicles of the type that might carry missiles, he said.

On Tuesday, Michael Spavor, director of the Paektu Cultural Exchange, which promotes business and cultural ties with the North, said on Twitter he had heard reports of such a parade, adding that his group would offer a trip for tourists to watch it.

In a statement issued late on Thursday, the SOA said several previously unreported slicks were spotted by planes, vessels and satellites near the disaster site. The SOA said one, seen 2.5 kilometers (km) east of the wreck site around 0600 local time on Thursday, may indicate leakage of extremely toxic bunker fuel, the heavy oil used in ship engines.
It remain unclear how much bunker fuel was left aboard the tanker, the Sanchi (IMO:93356608), when it sank. Experts estimated it may have been carrying about 1,000 tonnes at the time it collided with the CF Crystal (IMO:9497050) grain freighter.
Bunker fuel is noxious to marine organisms and difficult to remove from the sea once spilled, unlike the condensate fuel - an extremely light form of oil - that was being shipped by the Sanchi at the time of the collision. 
The Sanchi was carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate before the accident, most of which evaporated after the stricken shipped burned for days.
The SOA said it will continue carrying out monitoring and environmental impact assessment works. 
Three slicks covering a combined area of 20.7 square km were spotted by satellite, with the largest in size 17.4 square km, the SOA said in its statement. 
That combined area was 80.3 square km smaller than the total reported a day earlier. But water samples taken at four of the total 22 spill sites detected so far were found to exceed petroleum substance standards.

Duterte said he was aware of many cases of sexual abuse endured by Filipino women in Kuwait and that he had discussed the issue with his foreign minister and wanted to raise it with the Kuwait government.
""My advice is we talk to them, state the truth and just tell them that it's not acceptable anymore,"" he said on Thursday at the launch of a new bank catering for Filipinos abroad. He did not mention specific cases of abuse.
""Either we impose a total ban or we have the correction,"" he said.

There are more than 250,000 Filipinos in Kuwait, based on the Philippine foreign ministry's estimate, most of them working as domestic helpers. There are also large numbers of Filipinos working in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
More than 2.3 million Filipinos are documented as working abroad, from among some 8 million who live overseas.
Collectively they remit more than $2 billion of their income back to the Philippines every month, money that fuels robust consumer spending in one of the world's fastest-growing economies.
""I do not want a quarrel with Kuwait,"" Duterte said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing authorities on Friday took outspoken rights lawyer Yu Wensheng into custody as he was taking his child to school, his wife told Reuters, days after Yu said he was stripped of his legal license for criticizing President Xi Jinping. 
Yu, a Beijing-based lawyer and activist, has repeatedly criticized the ruling Communist Party over a sweeping crackdown on rights lawyers and activists, which has seen hundreds detained and dozens arrested in recent years. 
The authorities revoked Yu's license on Monday, citing rules requiring he be employed at a registered firm, but Yu told Reuters he believed the decision was in part reprisal for an open letter he wrote criticizing Xi's ""totalitarian"" rule. 
Early on Friday morning, as Yu was taking his child to school, he was stopped by a squad of four police vehicles and over 10 officers, and taken into custody, Yu's wife Xu Yan told Reuters. 
""I have not received any legal document about his detention and don't even know what crime he is suspected of committing,"" she said. 
Xu added that she is in the process of searching for a lawyer to defend Yu if necessary, but many of those lawyers she knows in Beijing also have problems with their licenses.
It is unclear where Yu is being held and if he has been charged with any crime. China's ministry of public security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On Thursday, Yu released another open letter calling for changes to China's state constitution to make elections fairer, reduce military power and delete a preamble that gives the Communist Party primacy in national leadership.
Yu had been involved in a number of high-profile and politically sensitive cases, including defending fellow veteran human rights lawyer Wang Yu, following her detention in the summer of 2016.
Yu was detained briefly in October 2017 during a meeting of China's top leadership after he wrote a letter in which he said Xi was unsuited to rule China and calling for his replacement.
Most recently, Yu had been attempting to defend another detained rights lawyer, Wang Quanzhang, but the authorities have barred him from meeting Wang.
Wang was detained 920 days ago and his case has yet to come to trial. Neither his wife or any of the lawyers that she has asked to defend Wang, including Yu, have been able to meet with him since.

The school next to the Futenma base on the southern island of Okinawa has become a focal point for discontent over the U.S. presence on the island since a window fell from a U.S. Marines helicopter onto its playground last month.
The Marines blamed the incident on ground personnel failing to secure the window properly and promised to try to fly around the school in future.
A string of recent aircraft incidents, including the falling window and emergency landings by two helicopters this month, have spurred renewed calls in Okinawa for the Americans to close some or all of their bases.
""It is unacceptable. We would like the U.S. to deal with this,"" Japan's Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera said.

The Marines insisted that their helicopters had avoided the school.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Friday she was pregnant with her first child, prompting an outpouring of support from women's rights groups and labor activists as she declared ""I'll be a prime minister and a mum"". 
Ardern said she planned to work until the end of her pregnancy in June and then take six-weeks leave, during which time Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters would run the country.
Speaking to reporters outside her Auckland home, Ardern said her partner Clarke Gayford would care for the ""surprise"" addition full-time and that the whole family would travel together when necessary.
""I am not the first woman to work and have a baby. I know these are special circumstances but there are many women who have done it well before I have,"" she said.
The popular 37-year-old politician's pregnancy is one of the very few examples of an elected leader holding office while pregnant and the first in New Zealand's history. Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto gave birth while she was prime minister in 1990.
Ardern, who came to power through a coalition deal after a closely fought election last year, has experienced a meteoric rise to power as New Zealand's youngest prime minister in more than a century, and its third female leader.
Ardern's rise to power has generated intense interest in her personal life and drew comparisons with other youthful leaders such as France's Emmanuel Macron and Canada's Justin Trudeau.
SIGN OF PROGRESS IN WOMEN'S RIGHTS 
Ardern was quick to assure the public that she would only take six weeks off, during which time she would still be contactable, so that the country would run as usual.
The short period contrasts with her party's parental leave policies, with the Labour-led coalition expanding paid parental leave from 18 to 22 weeks in one of its first legislative changes. That is set to rise again to 26 weeks in 2020.
Ardern acknowledged that she was ""lucky"" that her partner, a well-known television fishing show presenter, could take time off to travel with her while he cared for the baby full-time.
She had no plans to stop work until June and would fly to London in April to attend a Commonwealth leader's meeting.
Advocacy groups and politicians from across the political spectrum were quick to offer support.
""It's really inspiring...having our prime minister lead by example is a great sign of how far we've come in women's industrial rights in New Zealand,"" said Council of Trade Unions President Richard Wagstaff in an emailed statement to Reuters.
New Zealand has long held a progressive reputation, having been the first country to give women the right to vote in 1893. 
""It's amazing timing...125 years later we have a prime minister who's going to give birth in office,"" said Minister for Women Julie Anne Genter.
Ardern revealed on Friday that she had unexpectedly found out she was pregnant on Oct. 13, just six days before she was propelled into the country's top job when New Zealand First Party leader Peters announced he was siding with Labour in post-election negotiations.
When asked by a reporter how she had managed putting together a government while suffering from morning sickness, she replied, ""it's just what ladies do"".

North Korea admitted in 2002 it had kidnapped 13 Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s to train spies, and five of them returned to Japan. Tokyo suspects that hundreds more may have been taken.
Eight people, including Teruaki Masumoto, whose sister Rumiko is said by North Korea to have died, will travel to The Hague to urge the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for human rights abuses because of his refusal to provide information about their family members. 
The group will present a petition requesting investigation into the disappearances as a case of crimes against humanity to raise international attention about the issue, said Kazuhiro Araki, who heads a support group for families of the missing.
""Right now, with the Olympics, South Korea is really making a connection with the North, which we did not expect,"" Araki said, referring to talks between the two Koreas over the winter Olympics starting next month that have led to a thaw in cross-border ties.
""So we believe this will bring a lot of attention to Japan's different situation,"" he said.
North Korea has repeatedly pledged to reopen investigations into the fate of all missing Japanese, only to backtrack on those promises later. 
Araki acknowledged that the move would be mostly symbolic but said it was still valuable.
""Arresting Kim Jong Un and bringing him in would be rather difficult, but it's extremely important to show that there are human rights abuses taking place,"" he said.
One of those traveling to The Hague is Misa Morimoto, whose identical twin sister - so alike that they could swap classrooms and fool their high school teachers - vanished when they were 20 and is believed to have been abducted by Pyongyang. 
""As her family member, I want to do everything I possibly can,"" Morimoto said in an email.

Injured pedestrians lay sprawled out on the sidewalk, recalling recent terrorist attacks by vehicles mowing down pedestrians, but there was no indication that the Copacabana incident was deliberate.
The G1 news website reported the driver, who fled the scene but was quickly arrested by police, said he had an epileptic fit, and medicine for epilepsy was found in the car.
An officer at the Copacabana police station confirmed the baby's death by telephone and said 15 injured people were being treated in hospital. He did not know if the driver's epilepsy fit had been confirmed.
Witnesses said on the Globo News network that the racing car shot over a bicycle path and across the sidewalk, hitting people and crashing through tables and chairs, before coming to a stop on the sand of the beach. The smashed widescreen and dented roof indicated the force with which the vehicle had hit people.

The sidewalk of the Copacabana crescent-shaped beach is a favorite summer evening walk for Rio residents and tourists that have begun to arrive in Rio ahead of Carnival (LON:CCL) celebrations next month.

Moon's approval rating dropped to 67 percent, Gallup Korea said in a press release, down from last week's 73 percent and the second-lowest ever after the rating stood at 65 percent in late September last year.
North and South Korea started rare dialogue last week over the participation of North Korea in the Winter Games, and in addition to the joint ice hockey team, the two Koreas agreed on Wednesday to march under a unity flag at the Olympics.
The president's specific moves to bring together the two Koreas at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics have sparked a sharp public backlash that has gone beyond his traditional conservative detractors to include his main support base of young South Koreans.
Friday's poll showed Moon's approval rating among people in their 20s and 30s fell to 75 percent and 82 percent respectively, dropping by six percentage points and seven percentage points compared to the previous week's rating.
Gallup Korea also said approval ratings for Moon had dropped markedly among those in their 40s and below compared to those in their 50s and older. The latter are not part of Moon's main support base and tend to be more conservative in South Korea's political landscape.
Moon was elected to office in May last year with a high approval rating after his predecessor, Park Geun-hye, was removed from office over a corruption scandal. 

The latest poll of 1,005 adults, was conducted this week from Tuesday to Thursday this week and has a margin of error of plus minus 3.1 percent.

More than 200 people were arrested in connection with the protests in downtown Washington, during which black-clad activists smashed store windows, blocked traffic and fought with police.
A jury had already cleared six people of rioting charges in December, but the government said on Thursday it still intended to prosecute 59 remaining defendants. 
In the court filing, government attorneys did not detail why they planned to dismiss so many charges, but said the decision came in light of the December verdict. The government will focus its efforts on prosecuting people who participated in ""identifiable acts"" of violence, according to the filing.

Prosecutors have contended that the protesters were part of the group that became violent during the Inauguration Day protests. Those protests were far smaller than the Women's March the following day, in which hundreds of thousands of people poured into several major U.S. cities, including Washington.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Colombian peace process is a ""good reference"" for Mexico to follow to try and end years of drug violence, the security advisor of leftist presidential frontrunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Thursday. 
Lopez Obrador has chosen Alfonso Durazo, a veteran political operative who critics say has little law enforcement experience, as his pick to reactivate the public security ministry if he wins July's presidential election, tasking Durazo with the tough job of lowering a record murder tally. 
In an interview with Reuters in Mexico City, Durazo said he and his team would study successful efforts to end long-running conflicts from around the world, but adapt those solutions to meet Mexico's needs.
""The Colombian peace process is a good reference, but we need to design our own terms,"" said Durazo, who used to work with the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and has worked with Lopez Obrador since 2006. 
Durazo also cited the end of apartheid in South Africa, Spanish efforts to end the ETA conflict and Argentina's so-called Full Stop Law that helped reconcile a society riven by years of political repression, as models to learn from. 
Lopez Obrador has said Durazo, 63, would take a central role in restoring order after years of violence claiming tens of thousands of lives, while also making the contentious suggestion of exploring an amnesty for criminal gangs.
""Will we explore the possibility of an amnesty? Yes. We won't discard any idea that's on the table without evaluating it first,"" Durazo said. ""Will we sit down with the big cartel kingpins? I can't tell you right now.""
Nonetheless, he stressed that the focus was not on letting criminals off the hook, but rather seeking new ways to end the violence.
Durazo began his career as the private secretary of PRI presidential candidate Luis Colosio, working with him until he was assassinated in the 1994 presidential campaign. 
He then left the PRI before becoming the spokesman of former President Vicente Fox, of the National Action Party, who led the country from 2000-2006.
In 2006, Durazo joined forces with Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor and two-time presidential runner-up. 
Durazo said there were multiple causes of Mexico's violence, including poverty and lack of education.

LIMA (Reuters) - Pope Francis arrived in Peru on Thursday, as President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski appealed to the pontiff to help put the country back on track after a political crisis nearly ousted him from office a month ago.
    The Argentine pope landed in the Peruvian capital from neighboring Chile, on the second part of his visit to the two largely Roman Catholic South American nations, where he has sought to restore the Church's credibility after sex abuse allegations.
Kuczynski, who met the pope at the airport, has called for Francis to bring the country together following an outcry over his presidential pardon of former autocratic leader Alberto Fujimori.
""I hope the visit by Pope Francis puts us once more on the path to peace and dialogue,"" Kuczynski said on Twitter before the pope's arrival.
The pope was greeted by tens of thousands of exuberant followers on the streets of Lima. 
Francis will travel to two more Peruvian cities and celebrate Mass in Lima on Sunday, with more than 1 million expected to attend.
Ahead of his arrival, vandals set fire to the door to a church in the southern city of Arequipa and a statue of Jesus Christ on Lima's skyline was burned a week ago in what authorities blamed on a short circuit. The government warned this week that any unauthorized protesters would be arrested.
    Kuczynski's approval rating has fallen to around 20 percent since the pardon, which allowed Fujimori to leave prison less than halfway through a 25-year sentence for corruption and human rights abuse. It has widely been seen as part of a political deal that Kuczynski struck to remain in office.
Victims of human rights abuse under Fujimori had asked for an audience with the pope, though no such meeting is on his official schedule. 
    Catholic aid agency CAFOD, which normally abstains from political commentary, joined calls by activists for Francis to address the pardon during his stay in Peru.
    ""The pardon of Fujimori has opened the wounds of thousands of victims and their families who feel betrayed by this move and consider that forgiveness and reconciliation cannot be attained without justice,"" CAFOD said in a statement. ""A message on these issues from a spiritual leader would be welcomed by many.""
INDIGENOUS PLEA
    In Puerto Maldonado, a town at the heart of an illegal gold mining boom that has destroyed large swaths of pristine rainforest that Francis will visit on Friday, thousands of indigenous people gathered to celebrate the first papal visit to the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) since the 1980s. Many had traveled from neighboring Bolivia and Brazil. 
    ""Today our land is still being taken,"" said Cesar Augusto Yiraje, the chief of the Ese Ejja native community of Palma Real in Peru. ""Now with the arrival of the pope, history is being made in Madre de Dios,"" he said, referring to the Amazonian region. 
    Yiraje said he wanted to thank the Church for the help its missionaries gave to his tribe when rubber barons killed and enslaved most of its population, and reminded him that indigenous people are key to protecting the Amazon from deforestation.

    In a letter addressed to the pope, Amazonian chiefs asked for help in securing official titles to ancestral land and warding off incursions by outsiders.

1190,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 07:00PM ET</span>",U.S. won't pay $45 million pledged for Palestinian food aid for now,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will not provide $45 million in food aid for Palestinians that it pledged last month as part of the West Bank/Gaza Emergency Appeal led by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the U.S. State Department said on Thursday.
The State Department had said on Tuesday that Washington would withhold a separate $65 million it had planned to pay the U.N. agency that serves the Palestinians, saying UNRWA needed to make unspecified reforms.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert denied the withholding of the $65 million was to punish Palestinians, who have been sharply critical of Trump's announcement last month that he would move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.
In a Dec. 15 letter to UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krähenbühl, State Department Comptroller Eric Hembree had pledged $45 million to the West Bank/Gaza Emergency Appeal.
""The United States plans to make this funding available to UNRWA in early 2018,"" according to the letter, seen by Reuters on Thursday. ""An additional letter and contribution package confirming this contribution will be sent by or before early January 2018.""
The United States had made clear to UNRWA that the $45 million was a pledge aimed at helping the agency with ""forecasting,"" but it was not a guarantee, Nauert told reporters at a regular State Department briefing.
""At this time, we will not be providing that, but that does not mean - I want to make it clear - that does not mean that it will not be provided in the future,"" Nauert said.
She repeated the U.S. view that UNRWA needs reform, saying there are a lot more refugees in the program than previously, and that ""money coming in from other countries needs to increase as well to continue paying for all those refugees.""
""So we're asking countries to do more,"" Nauert said. ""Fundamentally, we just don't believe that we have to be the chief donor to every organization around the world.""
Despite the decision on the food aid pledge, she said: ""We are the most generous country on the planet. We continue to be.""
Trump said in a Twitter post on Jan. 2 that the United States gives the Palestinians hundreds of millions of dollars a year, ""but get no appreciation or respect.""
The decisions to curb funding are likely to compound the difficulty of reviving Israeli-Palestinian peace talks as well as further undermine Arabs' faith that the United States can act as an impartial arbitrator.

The last talks collapsed in 2014, partly due to Israel's opposition to an attempted unity pact between the Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas, and because of Israeli settlement building on occupied land that Palestinians seek for a state, among other factors.

By Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - African U.N. envoys suggested on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump meet with African leaders in Ethiopia this month after he was reported to have described some immigrants from Africa and Haiti as coming from ""shithole"" countries.
African ambassadors met with U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who told them she regretted the political drama around what was said a week ago at a White House meeting on immigration, according to diplomats at the U.N. meeting.
The diplomats said that South African U.N. Ambassador Jerry Matjila, who spoke on behalf of the group, told Haley that ""it could be useful"" for Trump to address African leaders directly when they meet in Addis Ababa at the African Union. 
That meeting is due to take place on Jan. 28-29, according to the African Union website.
Haley told the ambassadors she did not know what had been said in last week's White House meeting and promised to convey the African ambassadors' message to Trump when she meets with him in Washington on Friday, according to the diplomats. 
Trump has denied using such derogatory language.
The U.S. mission to the United Nations declined to comment on the U.N. meeting beyond a tweet it posted, which read: ""Thank you to the Africa Group for meeting today. We discussed our long relationship and history of combating HIV, fighting terrorism, and committing to peace throughout the region.""
African U.N. ambassadors issued a statement last Friday that said they were ""extremely appalled at, and strongly condemned the outrageous, racist, xenophobic remarks attributed to the president of the United States.""
They demanded Trump retract his remarks and apologize. 
According to diplomats at the U.N. meeting on Thursday, Haley also spoke about the billions of dollars that the United States had invested in the fight against HIV/Aids and terrorism in Africa and in humanitarian aid for South Sudan.

Haley traveled to Ethiopia, South Sudan and Democratic Republic of Congo in late October.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey dispatched its military chief to Moscow on Thursday, seeking approval for an air campaign in Syria's Kurdish-controlled Afrin region, although Damascus warned it could shoot down any Turkish planes in its skies.
Turkey's foreign minister said the Moscow trip by Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar was part of talks with both Russia and Iran, the two main backers of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, to allow Turkish planes to take part in an Afrin campaign.
The diplomacy was the strongest signal yet that Turkey plans direct military action against territory held by Kurdish militia, potentially opening a new front in Syria's civil war.
It would mean confronting Kurds allied to the United States at a time when Turkey's relations with Washington are reaching the breaking point. The U.S. State Department called on Turkey to focus on the fight against Islamic State militants and not take military action in Afrin.
""We would call ... on the Turks to not take any actions of that sort,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a briefing after being asked about apparent Turkish plans to attack Afrin. ""We don't want them to engage in violence but we want them to keep focused on ISIS.""
""We will intervene in Afrin,"" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told broadcaster CNN Turk, adding he did not expect Russia to oppose any operation there. ""We are meeting the Russians and Iran on the use of air space.""
Turkey has ratcheted up its threats to take military action in Afrin in the past week, in response to U.S. plans to support setting up a 30,000-strong force to guard areas held by Kurdish-led fighters in a large part of Syria east of Afrin.
Washington has become closely allied with the Syrian Kurds, who served as the main U.S. proxies on the ground in battle with Islamic State militants over the past two years. That infuriates Ankara, which considers the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia to be a branch of the banned PKK movement that has fought a decades-old insurgency against the Turkish state.
President Tayyip Erdogan called the new U.S.-backed border force a ""terror army"" on Turkey's border and vowed to ""strangle it before it's even born"".
The issue is one of several that have disrupted relations between Washington and its biggest Muslim ally within NATO. The countries are also at odds over the U.S. refusal to extradite a cleric Turkey blames for a failed 2016 coup, and the U.S. prosecution of a Turkish banker for sanctions busting, in which testimony implicated top Turkish officials.
In recent days Turkey has deployed tanks near the border with Syria across from the Afrin region, and Erdogan says Turkey's military has shelled Kurdish forces there.
Throughout most of the nearly seven-year-old Syrian civil war, Turkey has been one of the strongest opponents of Assad, joining the United States in supporting rebels fighting to overthrow him. More recently, Turkey has been working with Assad's backers Iran and Russia to reduce fighting between Assad and the rebels, while describing the Kurds as the main threat.
Cavusoglu said Akar would hold talks in Moscow with Russia's armed forces chief to discuss Afrin, Idlib ""and the future of Syria"".
Cavusoglu said Turkey needed to take into account the presence of a small number of Russian observers in Afrin. ""When we carry out an intervention, we need to coordinate on this, it should not impact the Russian observers,"" he said.
Cavusoglu said attacks were being targeted against Turkey from Afrin every day. The region of northern Syria controlled by Turkey-backed Syrian rebels was also being attacked, he said.
""Our response to this is our legitimate right to retaliate. We told the United States this,"" Cavusoglu said, adding that Turkey was not satisfied with U.S. attempts to allay its concern over U.S. support for the Kurdish-led border force.
On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he met Cavusoglu to clarify the issue, and said the situation had been ""misportrayed, misdescribed"".
""We voiced our discomfort in the meetings we held with the Secretary of Defence and the Secretary of State ... However, the United States' statements did not fully satisfy us,"" he said.

""Our direct mistrust of the United States continues.""

In contrast with previous presidential campaigns, in which Lopez Obrador's shrill replies to critics' jibes cost him votes, he has shown himself to be more relaxed ahead of the July 1 election, while toning down some policies to broaden his appeal. 
A spokesman for Jose Antonio Meade, his rival from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), warned on Wednesday about possible Russian interference in the July vote, with the aim of benefiting Lopez Obrador, a two-time runner-up.
The former Mexico City mayor, who is widely known as ""Peje"" after a thick-skinned fish prevalent in his home state of Tabasco, responded with a tongue-in-cheek video shot at a port, where he said he was waiting for a Russian submarine to surface laden with gold.
""I am no longer 'Peje,' now I'm Andres Manuelovich,"" he grinned.
Russia has been accused of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election won by President Donald Trump, and some in Mexico have voiced fears that the country led by Vladimir Putin could unleash Kremlin-backed hackers to sow chaos in the July vote.
At a joint news conference in Moscow in November with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, Mexico's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said there was no evidence Russia was trying to influence Mexico's election. Lavrov denied any interference. 
In an earlier video, AMLO, as he is also known, responded to a dig from President Enrique Pena Nieto by suggesting the Mexican leader should take an ""Amlodipine"" pill, a medication for high blood pressure.
Lopez Obrador, who maintains a strong lead in opinion polls, has also softened his image with videos of him at home with his wife and children, and engaged in everyday activities such as getting his haircut. 
Lopez Obrador's detractors have long compared him to former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, suggesting he would seek to usher in a socialist revolution in Mexico, Latin America's No. 2 economy.
Lopez Obrador says his movement draws its influence only from Mexican historical leaders.

The crash of a private Huey helicopter in rugged terrain near Raton, New Mexico, on Wednesday evening killed Bennett, 60, along with his wife, Heather Bennett, 55, James Coleman Dodd, 57, of Colorado, Charles Ryland Burnett, 61, of Texas and Paul Cobb, 67, of Texas, New Mexico State Police said.
Bennett, a former treasurer general of the opposition MDC party, was an important figure in Zimbabwean politics and served time in prison under former President Robert Mugabe. He recently told CNN that his country would never again let itself be ruled by a dictatorship.
""Roy was a resolute and committed fighter for democratic change in Zimbabwe,"" the MDC said in a statement.
The party described Bennett as a charismatic grassroots politician and successful farmer in the country's eastern Chimanimani District. He was fluent in Zimbabwe's Shona language, it said, and had helped hundreds of impoverished villagers pay school fees for their children.
Though white, Bennett fought for the rights of black Zimbabweans, the party said, and had the nickname ""Pachedu,"" a Shona word that translates as ""together"" or ""one of us.""

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan said on Thursday that Israel had formally apologized for the deaths of two of its citizens killed by an Israeli security guard last July in an incident that soured ties and led to the closure of the Israeli embassy in Amman, state media said.
Government spokesman Mohammad al Momani was quoted by state news agency Petra as saying the Israeli foreign ministry had sent a memorandum expressing ""deep regrets and apologies"" over the incident at the embassy and pledging to take legal action in the case.
Jordan had said it would not allow Israel to reopen its embassy in Amman until it launched legal proceedings against the security guard.
The Israeli prime minister's office said on Thursday that the embassy in Amman would resume full operations immediately.
The handling of the shooting had tested ties between Israel and Jordan, one of only two Arab states that has a peace treaty with Israel. The two have a long history of close security ties.
The embassy was closed shortly after Israel hastily repatriated the guard under diplomatic immunity to prevent Jordanian authorities interrogating him and taking any legal action against him. The Israeli ambassador and embassy staff were pulled out.
Jordan maintained that even if the guard had diplomatic immunity that did not mean he could not be punished.
Israel has now pledged to ""implement and follow up legal measures"" in the case and also take action in the shooting of an unarmed Jordanian judge by an Israeli soldier in an incident in 2014, Momani said. 
Israel would pay compensation to the three families, he said.
Israel said at the time the armed guard opened fire after being attacked and lightly wounded by the workman, who was delivering furniture at his home within the embassy compound, and acted in self-defense in what Israeli officials called a ""terrorist attack"".
Israel then said it was highly unlikely it would prosecute the security guard.
Jordanian officials have treated the shooting as a criminal case and say the two unarmed Jordanians - the other was a bystander - were killed in cold blood by the armed guard.
The government statement said the Israeli government had met all of Jordan's demands for the return of the ambassador and the reopening of the embassy.
Many Jordanians, in a country where the peace treaty with Israel is unpopular and pro-Palestinian sentiment widespread, were outraged that the guard was allowed to leave and staged protests calling on the authorities to scrap the 1994 peace treaty.

A televised welcome home for the guard and a hero's embrace from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had enraged King Abdullah. In a rare outburst, he accused Netanyahu of using the incident as a ""political show"" saying it was ""provocative on all fronts"".

The Islamic Jihad militant group has claimed responsibility for building the tunnel, saying its aim was to use it to attack Israel in the next armed confrontation.
Twelve Gaza militants, most of them from Islamic Jihad, were killed in the destruction of the tunnel and in rescue efforts when Israel destroyed the underground passage on October 30.
The tunnel, around the height and width of an upright person, was lined with concrete slabs. It was discovered about 120 meters inside Israel near Kissufim, about six meters below ground, as tunnelers burrowed towards the surface looking to build an exit, the Israeli military said.
""The tunnel that we see here is one of three tunnels that have been destroyed over the last two months,"" Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, said. ""The threat has not passed and the terror from Hamas has not passed.""
Palestinian tunnel diggers have long operated in border areas of the Gaza Strip, using the underground passageways to bypass tight border restrictions imposed by Israel and Egypt on the movement of goods and people, and to smuggle weapons.

Israel captured Gaza in a 1967 war. It is home to two million Palestinians, who complain that the blockade has left the enclave isolated and impoverished. Israel cites security concerns for the restrictions, tightened after the Islamist militant group Hamas took power in Gaza more than a decade ago.

1198,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",France to launch international group targeting toxic gas attacks,"UNITED NATIONS/PARIS (Reuters) - France has asked some 30 countries to work together to preserve evidence of chemical weapons attacks and impose sanctions on those responsible after Russia ended an international inquiry into who is to blame for using toxic gas in Syria.
France will host a meeting on Tuesday in Paris to launch the initiative, French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre told a United Nations Security Council meeting on nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction on Thursday.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is due to attend, the State Department said.
The group will work together ""collecting, conserving, exchanging and using ... all the mechanisms at our disposal to name the guilty parties and impose the necessary sanctions on them,"" according to the invitation sent to states and seen by Reuters.
""It is important that, when the time comes and the political timing is right, all the information on the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks and those who participated in their programs is immediately available so as to ensure they are brought to justice for their actions,"" the invitation said. 
The move comes after an international investigation into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria ended in November after Syrian ally Russia blocked for the third time in a month attempts at the United Nations to renew the inquiry, which Moscow has slammed as flawed.
In the past two years, the joint inquiry of the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) had found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin in an April 4, 2017 attack and has also several times used chlorine as a weapon. It blamed Islamic State militants for using mustard gas.
""The current paralysis of multilateral forums is preventing us from taking legal action against the perpetrators of these crimes and dissuading them from continuing down this path. This must change,"" the French invitation said. 
Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States. The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said accusations against the Syrian government were ""baseless"" and accused Western states of ignoring a chemical weapons threat posed by extremist groups.
""We are gravely concerned by the growing threat of chemical weapon terrorism in the Middle East. Specifically on the territory of Iraq and Syria,"" Lavrov told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday.

""We must bear in mind the real risks of chemical terrorism spilling over beyond the Middle East, taking into account the significant amounts of foreign fighters among extremists,"" he said.

1200,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 02:56PM ET</span>","Turkey detains five activists, including husband of freed German journalist: party","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish police on Thursday detained at least five members of two leftist parties, including the husband of German journalist Mesale Tolu, who was freed from prison last month, the Socialist Party of the Oppressed (ESP) said on social media.
The detentions came after police raids early on Thursday morning that targeted members of ESP and the Federation of Socialist Youth Associations (SGDF) in four provinces, including its major cities Istanbul and Ankara.
ESP said at least five members of the two parties were detained, including ESP Central Executive Board member Suat Corlu, the husband of the German journalist.
The news could complicate fledgling efforts by Berlin and Ankara to mend strained ties between the two NATO allies.
On Wednesday, the two countries resumed bilateral consultations that were suspended after Ankara's arrest of another German-Turkish journalist, Deniz Yucel, in February 2017, although they remain at odds over his case.
Germany, home to some 3 million people with a Turkish background, remains critical of Turkey's arrests after a failed 2016 coup of some 50,000 people, and the suspension or firing of 150,000 others, including teachers, judges and soldiers.
Turkey says the crackdown on alleged supporters of a network of followers of a Muslim cleric it blames for the coup is needed to shore up security, and has criticized Germany's refusal to hand over asylum seekers it says were involved in the putsch.
Efforts to improve German-Turkish relations were bolstered last month when Turkey released Tolu after nearly eight months in prison and other German citizens.
Ankara has charged Tolu with being a member of a terrorist organization and publishing terrorist propaganda following the attempted military coup in July 2016. 
Her husband, Suat Corlu, a journalist, had also been detained but was released in November. Both continue to face charges in Turkey, and Ankara has banned Tolu from leaving the country.
Germany insists that the detentions of Yucel and other journalists detained after the coup are unjustified and politically motivated.

Police in the southern African country had become deeply unpopular for their traffic checkpoints, which many motorists and foreign tourists saw as a means of shaking down drivers for money.
Following the de facto military coup that removed 93-year-old Robert Mugabe from power, police initially withdrew from the streets and were replaced by soldiers, but over the past few weeks returned with orders not to harass motorists.
The Herald reported that those fired were of the rank of assistant commissioner and above, and that this was effective from Thursday.
When asked about the sacking of the senior officers, acting police chief Godwin Matanga, who took over last month from Augustine Chihuri, a Mugabe acolyte, told the newspaper that ""something is happening"" but would not comment further.
Matanga could not be contacted for further comment.
New President Emmerson Mnangagwa last month promised zero tolerance in his government's push to punish corruption that stifled political freedom and economic growth during Mugabe's 37-year rule.

1202,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",German parliament votes to step up fight against anti-Semitism,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's lower house of parliament on Thursday voted to step up efforts to combat anti-Semitism and called for the creation of a new government post to oversee the issue, backed by an independent panel of experts.
The proposal was jointly introduced and backed by Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), the pro-business Free Democrats and the Greens.
The far-right Alternative for Germany party also voted for the measure, while the radical Left party voted against, citing what it called substantive deficiencies in the proposal.
The voice vote, which lays the groundwork for a spate of legislative initiatives during this session of parliament, was welcomed widely by Jewish groups. 
Volker Kauder, head of the conservatives in parliament, spoke in favor of the proposal given Germany's Nazi past and the murder of 6 million Jews during the Third Reich.
""We have a particular responsibility to ensure that anti-Semitism does not continue to grow in our country,"" he said during the parliamentary debate.
Kauder also vowed to examine whether Germany could ban the burning of Israeli flags, following incidents in December during protests against a U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Anti-Semitism remains a hugely sensitive issue in Germany more than 70 years after the end of the Nazi-era Holocaust.
Jewish and civil rights groups have long called for the appointment of a special commissioner to address growing anti-Semitism, which they say has been fueled by right-wing populism and the arrival of many migrants from mostly Muslim countries.
The Central Council of Jews welcomed the vote, calling it an important signal that their concerns were being addressed.
""The fight against anti-Semitism is all of our responsibility,"" the group said in a statement. ""The respectful treatment of minorities is part of the core values of our democracy.""
Josef Schuster, the group's president, called for increased efforts to include anti-bias training in integration courses for migrants, but explicitly rejected any effort to instrumentalize the issue to discriminate against Muslims or others.
Jewish groups last month called for legal changes and increased enforcement to crack down on anti-Semitic acts following the burning of Jewish symbols and Israeli flags.
The proposal calls for the creation of a new commissioner post to coordinate efforts to tackle anti-Semitism by the federal government, states and civil society.
It foresees the creation of an independent advisory panel with Jewish and non-Jewish experts from academic, education and other sectors, as well as a federal-state commission.

The proposal also calls for improved gathering of statistics on anti-Semitic incidents, tighter laws banning Holocaust denial on the internet and consequences for the immigration status of foreign citizens who incite hatred.

U.S. media outlet Buzzfeed reported this week that U.S. officials investigating allegations of Kremlin interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election were studying records of financial transactions involving Russian diplomats. Buzzfeed cited details of several bank transfers.
""It's obvious that this could not have happened without the knowledge of the authorities of that country (the United States),"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
""In other words, this intrusion on the sanctity of the accounts of the embassy and its staff, who have diplomatic immunity, is the work of Washington officialdom.""
The statement said that the transactions that were leaked contained nothing except routine payments, but that these were being twisted to make them appear suspicious.
""Once again we have to note that Washington is not ensuring the appropriate conditions for the functioning of Russia's diplomatic missions. The pressure on them continues and is growing,"" said the ministry.

""We demand that the American authorities, at last, start implementing their own national laws and international obligations, immediately stop the unlawful distribution of confidential information .... and hold responsible those who are to blame, including those who hold relevant posts in the American state administration.""

1204,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",EU keen to avoid a fight with Warsaw but will want real concessions,"By Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A new charm offensive should buy Poland time in its confrontation with the EU over backsliding on democracy, but Warsaw will have to make some real policy changes to match the warmer words or risk losing some funds from the bloc.
Poland, under the Catholic, nationalist Law and Justice Party (PiS) in power since 2015, has become one of the main headaches for the EU, worried that some ex-communist states in eastern Europe are becoming more authoritarian.
The EU complains about Warsaw's steps to impose more direct government control of the courts, and has threatened to take action to defend the bloc's liberal values. The EU also wants Poland to drop its refusal to accept refugees to share the burden of a migration surge.
Last month, Beata Szydlo stepped down as prime minister after two years of unrelenting confrontation with Brussels. 
Her successor, former banker Mateusz Morawiecki, has taken a less strident tone toward both the EU and domestic political foes, suggesting a PiS effort to ease tensions with Brussels and reach out to more moderate voters at home.
Morawiecki's milder words are a relief in Brussels and capitals of EU member states, anxious to avoid being pushed to go ahead with the so-called ""nuclear option"": an unprecedented Article 7 procedure to punish Poland.
Such a move would deepen divisions and consume the energy of a bloc already coping with Britain's departure. It would also almost certainly fail in the end anyway, subject to a veto by the chief PiS ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Still, officials and diplomats in Brussels say they are not prepared to settle for mere words. They have other tools they can use to apply pressure, notably a coming round of funding decisions for EU spending in 2021-2027. The bloc is considering attaching conditions that could limit some funds to states that fail to meet rule-of-law standards.
""Whether the rule of law, or migration, it will all come to its head in the budget talks. There will be some real deals to make or break,"" said an EU diplomat.
Some speak of even tougher measures. Two diplomats said that EU states could threaten to reintroduce temporary border controls with Poland, a step that was made easier for security reasons since the bloc's migration crisis.
""The joint budget is a lot of money - but only that much. The other fish to fry is being able to travel and trade with no border checks that hurt business,"" said one of the diplomats.
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE
Morawiecki's opening visit in Brussels will be followed with talks between his Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz and the executive European Commission's deputy head, Frans Timmermans, on Sunday.
""We need full respect for the rule of law in all our member states,"" Timmermans told the European Parliament this week. ""It is a fundamental issue for the functioning of the EU.""
Few in Brussels expect Morawiecki to sharply change the PiS line. He has said he is fully behind the PiS overhaul of the judiciary, which he says is needed to rid Poland of post-communist relics.
While Morawiecki is unlikely to backtrack soon on the major points of conflict with Brussels, he could offer some concessions in other areas, such as the environment, including disputes over forest logging and tightening of rules for greenhouse gas emissions.
Progress on the logging dispute could even be portrayed in Brussels as a step forward on the rule of law, since Brussels accuses Warsaw of violating European court rulings by felling too many trees despite being told by a tribunal to stop.
Brussels diplomats point to Hungary's Orban as an example of someone who has avoided any major retribution from the bloc despite antagonizing Brussels for years. 
Rights groups say his steps to tighten the screws on critics, media, judges, academics and non-governmental organizations are weakening democracy. They are also similar to those pursued by Poland's PiS.
But unlike the PiS so far, Orban, in power since 2010, has not shied away from debating his policies with Brussels, keeping dialogue open and offering occasional concessions.

""Poland has to start a real dialogue and then we'll see. Article 7 can be pursued with more or less energy, it can still be on the agenda but not decided for now,"" another senior diplomat said. ""Eventually, a nicer face won't be enough.""

The country's efforts to join NATO and the European Union have been blocked by Greece, which says the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim over Greece's own northern region of that name.
Until the row is resolved, Athens has agreed only that the country be referred to internationally as ""FYROM"" (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), the name under which it was admitted to the United Nations in 1993, though the two states last week agreed to hold talks on the matter.
""NATO's door remains open,"" Jens Stoltenberg told journalists on Thursday after meeting Macedonia Prime Minister Zoran Zaev. 
He said resolving the name dispute is crucial for Macedonia to join NATO, but urged the country to improve the rule of law, build good relations with neighboring nations and develop a multi-ethnic society. 
""It's not easy, but it can be done,"" Stoltenberg said.
In 2001 NATO and Western diplomacy pulled Macedonia from the brink of civil war during an ethnic Albanian insurgency and promised it faster integration into the EU and NATO. 
Zaev's government, which took power last May, pledged to work on resolving the name dispute and accelerate the country's EU and NATO bid. 
The EU and NATO see the Western Balkan region as important for issues from controlling immigration to countering security threats. 
NATO has noted important progress on transparency, accountability, oversight of the intelligence and security agencies and judicial reform, Stoltenberg told the Macedonian parliament on Thursday. 
""That must continue,"" he said. ""We hope to see similar progress on electoral reform, reform of the media and greater transparency in government finances.""

Oscar Perez, a photogenic former pilot who once starred in an action film, was killed on Monday along with six others in a police raid on a remote house.
Last year he used a hijacked helicopter to attack government buildings and stole weapons from a military base in what he called a rebellion against President Nicolas Maduro.
The opposition coalition, which had been due to meet government officials in the Dominican Republic, was furious at an accusation by Interior Minister Nestor Reverol that it provided information leading to the operation.
""We demand a rectification of these accusations,"" the opposition said in a statement, confirming it was pulling out of Thursday's talks but would be open to future meetings.
Previous attempts at talks, including one led by the Vatican, have failed in recent years. 
Opposition leaders are demanding Maduro accept humanitarian assistance from abroad to ease a severe economic crisis that has led to shortages of food and medicines and is also calling for the release of several hundred jailed political activists.
Venezuelan authorities want the opposition to help pressure for an end to sanctions levied last year by the United States.

Both sides are also focused on a presidential election this year, although no date has been set.

The country's corporate regulator last week revoked the site's operating license for violating the constitution's restrictions on foreign ownership of media, while the justice minister on Wednesday ordered an investigation into Rappler's possible criminal liability.
Known for its investigative reporting, Rappler has repeatedly drawn the ire of the volatile Duterte, who on Tuesday called it a ""fake news outlet"", but he denied influencing the regulator, or going after journalists. [nL3N1PC2S7]
Rappler is permitted to operate pending an appeal. It denies violating the constitution and has accused the Duterte administration of harassment. 
On Thursday, Rappler confirmed it had received a subpoena by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), a copy of which seen by Reuters, ordering its chief executive Maria Ressa, one of the site's investors, and one of its former journalists to appear at the NBI offices on Monday to ""give your side in a certain investigation"".
Rappler Managing Editor Glenda Gloria told Reuters the subpoena, dated Jan. 10, was received only on Thursday afternoon, eight days after the date of issue.
The subpoenas were based on a complaint from a businessman who featured in a Rappler story in 2012. Neither the nature of the complaint, nor the date in which it was filed, were stated in the subpoena.
Media and human rights groups have expressed alarm at what they say is an attempt by the Duterte administration to intimidate the media. 
The government denies it is cracking down on journalists, and says Rappler broke the law by granting an American investor the power to have a say in its operations. Rappler insists that is not the case.
Rappler's reporting has included close scrutiny of Duterte's deadly war on drugs and a series of investigative reports into what it says is his government's strategy to ""weaponise"" the internet, using bloggers on its payroll to stir up anger among online supporters who threaten and discredit Duterte's critics.
The government denies that.
Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre on Thursday defended his decision to order probes into Rappler.

""Rappler should welcome this investigation so that it will have the chance to prove the innocence it claims to have,"" he said in a statement, responding to what Rappler calling that investigation a ""fishing expedition"".

President Maithripala Sirisena had said on Sunday the ban would be reimposed. On Thursday, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said he had canceled his decision to lift it at the ""request of the Cabinet of Ministers"". 
In a filing to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, a group of 11 women activists opposed reinstating the ban, which also prevents women from working in liquor stores.
""Any such measure would deprive the members of the female gender who have attained the requisite age specified by law from being lawfully employed at places of production and sale of liquor,"" the petitioners said in their filing.
Officials at the finance ministry said the ban was lifted after repeated requests from the tourism industry to extend bar hours and allow female tourists to buy alcohol. 
But that move was criticized by opposition parliamentarians, who said the move would damage Sri Lanka's Buddhist values. Sinhalese Buddhists account for more than 70 percent of the island nation's 21 million population.

In its World Report 2018, which reviews human rights practices in more than 90 countries, the rights group reported it had documented 87 unlawful attacks by the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, leading to nearly 1,000 civilian deaths.
Yemen's internationally recognized government, backed by the coalition and supported by the United States and Britain, is trying to roll back the Iran-aligned Houthi group which controls most of northern Yemen.
The coalition has repeatedly denied allegations of war crimes and says its attacks are directed against its Houthi foes, not civilians.
The government's communications office did not have an immediate comment on the report when contacted by Reuters.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has rocketed to the pinnacle of power in the kingdom, pushing a reform agenda called Vision 2030 aimed at weaning the country off oil and introducing social changes.
Last week, women were allowed to attend a men's soccer match in stadiums for the first time. Women-focused motorshows opened in Jeddah and Riyadh this week. A decades-long ban on screening films was lifted in the conservative kingdom this week. 
Meanwhile, the New York-based group said, more than a dozen prominent political activists convicted on ""vague charges arising from their peaceful activities"" were serving lengthy prison sentences.
“Mohammad bin Salman’s well-funded image as a reformist falls flat in the face of Yemen’s humanitarian catastrophe and scores of activists and political dissidents languishing in Saudi prisons on spurious charges,” Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said.
“Baby steps on women’s rights reforms don’t paper over Saudi Arabia’s systemic abuses.”

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>","Shutting out immigrants is not Christian, pope says","By Philip Pullella and Marion Giraldo
IQUIQUE, Chile (Reuters) - Pope Francis said on Thursday that it is not Christian to shut out immigrants, urging nations to welcome people whose lives had been ""watered down"" by poverty, injustice and exploitation.
Francis, whose defense of migrants and refugees has been a key theme of his nearly 5-year-old pontificate, spoke on his last day in Chile before he was due to leave for Peru to start the second and last leg of his Latin American tour. 
""There is no Christian joy when doors are closed; there is no Christian joy when others are made to feel unwanted, when there is no room for them in our midst,"" he said in the homily of Mass on a beach in this city in Chile's far north.
""The cry of the poor is a kind of a prayer; it opens our hearts and teaches us to be attentive,"" he said from an enormous white stage framed by dune-like desert mountains on one side and the hazy blue of the Pacific Ocean on the other.
The pope has stepped up his defense of immigrants in recent months as migration has become a hot political issue in many countries.
In the United States, lawmakers are still grappling with the fate of so-called dreamers, who were brought to the country illegally as children and now face deportation after decades of living there.
In Europe, the German far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party became a key force last year, and in Italy, the anti-immigrant Northern League is expected to make gains in national elections in March.
Francis urged his listeners to be attentive to ""all situations of injustice and to new forms of exploitation"" including by those who profit from immigrants' problems, such as lack of documentation.
The trials and difficulties of immigrants trying to keep their families together had left many feeling like ""their lives had been watered down,"" he said as 50,000 people faced the stage and the ocean.
WAVE OF ARRIVALS
Chile has had much less immigration than other South American nations, but a stable economy and moderate politics since the end of the Pinochet dictatorship in 1990 have made it more attractive to those fleeing economic hardship elsewhere in Latin America.
A wave of recent arrivals from Haiti and Venezuela has increasingly stoked anti-immigrant sentiment in Chile.
The region around Iquique, which means ""dreams,"" in the local indigenous Aymara language, has the country's highest percentage of migrants, according to official statistics.
People from neighboring Peru, Argentina, Ecuador and Bolivia have been attracted to Chile's northern desert region, home to the majority of mines and a booming service and construction industry in the world's biggest copper exporter. 
But many who arrive seeking their fortunes have instead found poverty and exclusion. 
""There are many immigrants here who don't have work, who live with very little, in rooms like animals,"" said Dora Reyes, a Peruvian shopkeeper who moved to Chile two decades ago. ""There is still a lot of racism and inequality.""
Although immigration remains proportionally low compared with most developed countries, it has grown fivefold over the last 30 years, statistics from the government's immigration service show.

Arrivals from Haiti surged 144 percent in 2015, while those from recession-hit Venezuela soared 192 percent.

BERLIN (Reuters) - On the face of it, a fresh-faced, hoodie-wearing 28-year-old is an unlikely threat to the leader of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD), let alone to conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel. 
Yet before an SPD vote on Sunday on whether to enter formal talks with Merkel, the leader of the party's Jusos youth wing has struck a chord with members with his campaign against a re-run of the ""grand coalition"" that has ruled Germany since 2013.
""The chancellor is hanging on a Jusos drip,"" wrote the daily Die Welt this week, reflecting a flurry of headlines about Kevin Kuehnert, Jusos leader since November, as a potential nemesis for the upper middle-aged leaders of Germany's two main parties. 
Three days before SPD delegates decide whether to enter formal coalition negotiations with Merkel's conservatives, Kuehnert, a Berliner, looked serious but relaxed. 
""To keep returning to a grand coalition out of fear that everything else is even worse really diminishes the SPD in the long run,"" Kuehnert told reporters.
His style brings a breath of fresh air to the somewhat staid world of German politics. In an open-necked black shirt, jeans and trainers, Kuehnert stood in front of a microphone and spoke articulately without notes. 
Despite the age difference, some German media have called him Germany's Jeremy Corbyn, the 68-year-old leftist leader of Britain's Labour party leader who has galvanized young supporters.
""OPTIMISTIC""
Kuehnert's clear message and congenial manner have resonated. SPD rank and file are split over the policy blueprint deal that would be the basis for talks with the conservatives.
""I am very optimistic that on Sunday, we have a real chance of winning the vote,"" Kuehnert told reporters at SPD headquarters, a venue he said he chose to emphasize solidarity with the party.
The stakes could barely be higher. 
If delegates vote against the blueprint agreed with Merkel, SPD chairman Martin Schulz is widely expected to quit. 
Moreover, Merkel would have failed twice at forming a coalition after a previous attempt with other parties collapsed in November, putting a big question mark over her own future. The result could be a minority government or new elections.
However, Kuehnert is at pains not to attack Schulz. ""After Sunday, I won't be calling for anyone to resign,"" he said.
A soccer fan whose mother works in a jobs center, Kuehnert sought to demolish the argument made by some in the SPD that it must avoid a new election due to its dismal ratings, by saying an election is not inevitable if there is no grand coalition. 
In the September election, the SPD saw its support slump to 20.5 percent, its lowest since 1933 and underlining its loss of identity and profile in a coalition that was dominated by Merkel. Now opinion polls put it on at 18 percent.
Kuehnert is adamant that the SPD needs to go into opposition to reinvent itself. ""We are looking for a path that will lead the SPD back to being the big left party again,"" he said.

Former Jusos leaders include ex-chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whom Merkel defeated to start her first term in office back in 2005, and Andrea Nahles, who is tipped as a possible successor to Schulz.

Aboard the Papal Plane (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Thursday performed another first, a wedding ceremony for a steward and stewardess, aboard a plane taking him between two Chilean cities.
Paula Podest Ruiz, 39, and Carlos Ciuffardi Elorriga, 41, told the pope they had been married in a civil service but their planned religious ceremony in their parish church in Santiago could not take place because it was heavily damaged in the country's 2010 earthquake. 
They asked him to bless their marriage. But he had something else in mind. 
""Do you want me to marry you?"" he asked them. 
""Here?"" they asked, astonished.
The pope said yes and he performed a brief ceremony in the front of the plane. An airline executive was the official witness and a document was signed by a Chilean bishop on board. 
""Everything is valid. Everything is official,"" said Vatican spokesman Greg Burke. ""We will show you a picture of the document later.""

After a resignation in 2011 amid scandal over his private life and an acute debt crisis the billionaire media mogul has bounced back. He is now leading a center-right coalition which polls see as having the best chance of forming a government after elections on March 4.
However, the coalition has no jointly agreed candidate for prime minister and the 81-year-old had not indicated previously he would be willing to take on the job.
Berlusconi was convicted of tax fraud in 2013 and subsequently stripped of his seat in the upper house Senate and banned from holding office until 2019, a decision he has asked the European court to overturn. [nL8N1NS1Q3] 
""I would have a duty ... if a ruling were to arrive from Strasbourg that reversed the Senate's decision to expel me, I don't think I could refuse,"" he said on La7 television.
He acknowledged he thought it ""unlikely"" that the Strasbourg court would come up with a ruling before the vote. Judges began hearing arguments in the case only in November and could take several more months.
Berlusconi's main coalition partner, leader of the anti-immigrant League Matteo Salvini, has made clear he wants to be premier.
But Berlusconi dismissed this. ""Forceful center-forward that he is, he could do well at the Interior Ministry,"" he said.
Despite this a person close to Berlusconi said he seemed not to want another mandate as prime minister and suggested he would settle for staying at the head of his Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party and back a different candidate to head the government.
""I don't have the sense he wants to play another round as prime minister,"" said the source, who asked not to be named. 
He has floated the names of a military police general, European Central Bank governor Mario Draghi or the CEO of carmaker Fiat Chrysler, Sergio Marchionne. [nL8N1NX1CP]
The center-right coalition, which also includes the smaller, right-wing Brothers of Italy, is polling well ahead of its nearest rivals, but is still shy of the 40 percent consensus that would give it a realistic chance of governing alone. 

Whichever center-right party gets the most votes will choose the prime minister candidate, their leaders have agreed. Currently, Forza Italia is ahead, polling between roughly one and six points above the League.

JUBA (Reuters) - Britain said it was closely monitoring a ceasefire agreed last month between South Sudan's warring parties and would work with regional partners to identify individuals guilty of violations and take action.
South Sudan has been wracked by a four-year civil war that broke out after a political disagreement between former vice president Riek Machar and incumbent leader Salva Kiir degenerated into military confrontation. 
Last month, the two sides signed a ceasefire deal in Addis Abba. 
In an interview in South Sudan's capital Juba this week, British special envoy Chris Trott told Reuters:
""Anyone that spoils the chances of peace should understand that we are watching...any breach of the peace process.
""We have seen...violations of the agreement and what we are saying to the parties is that this is unacceptable.""
He urged regional countries to report promptly on any violations, identifying individuals, and ""we would like you to send the message by doing X or Y"". He did not specify what this might involve.
Trott was speaking ahead of planned meetings with South Sudanese officials and said he would make it very clear to the government it was expected to honor the ceasefire.
Britain is among world powers trying to put diplomatic pressure on both the South Sudan government and rebels to end the fighting and agree a peace. 
Since the deal was signed, several violations have occurred, with both sides blaming each other for the breach.
Early this month several people were killed after fighting broke out near Juba.
The army blamed the rebels who they said attempted to seize a military outpost west of Juba.
Attorneys defending two jailed members of former vice- president Machar's staff said they had quit, citing what they called the government's violation of the agreement by failing to release all political prisoners.
South African national William John Endley and James Gatdet Dak, who served as advisor and spokesman for Machar, were arrested in 2016 and have been in detention since. Both were charged with crimes including conspiracy, treason and publishing materials harmful to the state.
Monyluak Alor Kuol, head of the two defendants' legal team told Reuters their clients' continued prosecution contradicted the spirit of last month's ceasefire.
""As lawyers, we cannot encourage impunity (on the part of the government) and that is why we withdrew,"" he said.

The killing of Marine general Saiid Aden Yusuf in what was apparently an internal dispute is a fresh sign of problems facing the army as it battles an insurgency by Islamist militant group al Shabaab with the help of African Union peacekeepers.
""Our marine general was killed by his deputy at Mogadishu seaport today. The murderer was seized. It was unfortunate and unexpected. An investigation goes on,"" marine officer Ahmed Ali told Reuters.
Mogadishu resident Nur Mohamed told Reuters the colonel fired several shots from his pistol and hit the general in the head. 
""I was chatting with the general shortly before he was killed .... I heard the gunshots and when I ran to the scene I was shocked to see the general lying on the ground, bleeding,"" he said, adding that Yusuf died on the scene from bullet wounds.
Marine officer Ahmed Ali said the colonel was arrested.
Al Shabaab is fighting to oust the government and establish its own rule based on its strict interpretation of Islam's sharia law.
The group has been pushed out of most of its urban strongholds but it is able to mount deadly attacks in Mogadishu and elsewhere.
Somalia has faced violence and lacked a strong central government since President Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991.

The region's former leader Carles Puigdemont, who has been in Brussels since October to avoid arrest for leading a secession bid, is the separatists' candidate to lead Catalonia again.
He and two other lawmakers from his party asked the regional parliament's committee to let other lawmakers cast their votes for them in the ballot, the first round of which must be held by Jan. 31, a source from Puigdemont's party said.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy earlier said the former leader could not vote or be elected if he was not present at the assembly, after some in his party suggested Puigdemont might rule Catalonia from abroad.
""Today, we asked parliament to allow a delegation of votes for the three lawmakers who are in Brussels,"" the source said.
The Catalan parliament's committee, which overseas how the administration runs, was set up on Wednesday with a majority of separatist members.
While the question of voting and ruling from abroad has received lots of attention recently, the Spanish government has also warned that it would appeal to the Constitutional Court if the committee allowed Puigdemont to vote by proxy.
Members of the parliament's committee can be held legally responsible for their actions. Some members of the previous committee are the target of a judicial probe over the illegal independence referendum organised in October.
Rajoy's deputy Soraya Saenz de Santamaria on Thursday urged parliament to respect the law, telling Cadena Cope radio: ""He (Puigdemont) knows it, he can't rule from the Bahamas.""
The previous Puigdemont-led administration made a unilateral declaration of independence in October after the referendum, triggering one of Spain's biggest political crises since its return to democracy four decades ago. The government in Madrid imposed direct rule on the region.

Rajoy called regional elections on Dec. 21 in a bid to weaken the independence movement, but the vote returned an assembly with a separatist majority.

BELGRADE (Reuters) - Hundreds of mourners came to Belgrade's central cemetery on Thursday to attend the funeral of a Kosovo Serb leader whose killing stoked tensions between Serbia and its former province of Kosovo. 
Oliver Ivanovic, 64, was shot six times on Tuesday as he arrived at his party office in Mitrovica, a Kosovo town bitterly divided between majority ethnic Albanians and minority Serbs.
Ivanovic had been facing a retrial over killings of ethnic Albanians during Kosovo's 1998-99 guerrilla uprising against repressive Serbian rule.
His body was brought by car to Serbia's capital, 420 km (260 miles) north of Mitrovica, escorted by mourners.
""The best among Kosovo Serbs was slain and the damage cannot be undone. This death will haunt us politically,"" said Nevenka Medic, a Mitrovica Serb, clutching a red rose to place on Ivanovic's grave. 
Ivanovic rose to prominence shortly after the war as one of Mitrovica's ""bridge-watchers"" - nationalist Serbs who sought to block ""infiltration"" by Albanians over the Ibar River bridge into the northern half of the town.
After the group disbanded, Ivanovic entered politics and became known as a relative moderate for advocating post-war dialogue and compromise with Kosovo Albanians, while still refusing to recognize Kosovo's 2008 independence from Serbia. 
Serbs from Belgrade and from Kosovo queued to lay wreaths and flowers and offer condolences to Ivanovic's wife who stood next to the coffin in front of the cemetery's main chapel. 
SERBIAN GOVERNMENT LEADERS
Among them were top Serbian government officials including Prime Minister Ana Brnabic and Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic, as well as opposition leaders.
""He was heard with attention by both foreigners and Serbs and often Albanians, for him Kosovo was more than just territory and politics,"" Orthodox Bishop Teodosije said in a eulogy. 
An EU-sponsored dialogue on the normalization of ties between Serbia and Kosovo was suspended when Belgrade's delegation walked out after the killing, saying it would return only once Ivanovic's killers are brought to justice. 
During a visit to neighboring Macedonia, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Ivanovic's killing was ""an example of how the situation in Kosovo is not where we would like it to be"". About 4,600 NATO troops remain in Kosovo as peacekeepers.
Kosovo police said they had traced the owner of a burned car believed to be linked to the killers and were interviewing potential witnesses. No one heard the shots as, according to investigators, the gunman likely used a silencer.
In 2016, Ivanovic was convicted by an European Union-run court of inciting murders of ethnic Albanians during the war and sentenced to nine years in prison. He appealed, arguing the evidence was forged, and a retrial was ordered.
Serbian officials said the accusations were trumped up.
Kosovo's estimated 50,000 Serbs live in a northern pocket that has been in legal limbo since the war - politically loyal to Serbia but effectively a no-go territory for both Serbian and Kosovo police, with Serb criminal gangs - some of whose members are ex-""bridge-watchers"" - exerting a powerful grip.
Ivanovic's car was set on fire last year in what he called a politically motivated attack.

His widow Milena said she planned to move to Belgrade along with their 7-year old son. ""My son and I have finished with Mitrovica - it's a town of fear, darkness and pain,"" she said.

NIAMEY (Reuters) - Suspected Boko Haram fighters have killed at least four soldiers and a civilian in an attack on a military post in Niger's southeastern Diffa region, local officials and two security sources said on Thursday. 
The attack took place on Wednesday evening in the village of Toumour, near Lake Chad and the Nigerian border, in an area plagued by attacks by the Islamist militant group during its eight-year-old bid to create a caliphate in and around its Nigerian base. 
A hospital official said eight soldiers were injured in the ambush, which security officials said bore the hallmarks of past Boko Haram attacks. Four others are missing, said a security source, who also said the bodies of four suspected Boko Haram militants were found at the scene. 
A government spokesman was not immediately available for comment. 
A local police source said heavily-armed assailants entered the village on motorcycles and other vehicles, one of which was painted in the colors of Niger's army. Fighters had stripped villagers of their mobile phones hours before to prevent them from alerting the authorities, residents said.
Troops were taken by surprise and abandoned their position, allowing the militants to confiscate 10 armored vehicles before retreating to their stronghold in neighboring Nigeria, the security sources said. 
Air force and other troops have since reached the area and allowed soldiers to regain control of the position, they said. 
Boko Haram has been trying since 2009 to establish an Islamic state in northeast Nigeria, from where it has launched attacks and suicide bombings in Niger, Chad and Cameroon. Over 15,000 people have been killed and millions displaced. 
An assault on the nearby town of Bosso in June 2016 killed 32 soldiers, prompting Chad to send 2,000 troops to help Niger counter the militants. 
Those troops were withdrawn in October last year, raising renewed concern about security in the Diffa region.

The group's base was in Prato, near Florence, a hub for the textile industry where many factories are owned and run by Chinese, police said in a statement. 
But the network had members in other parts of Italy and across Europe, with arrests sought in Rome, Milan, Padua, Paris, Madrid and Neuss, Germany, the statement said. Police did not say how many had been arrested so far.
They are accused of being members of a mafia organization and other crimes.
The suspected boss, Zhang Nai Zhong, was based in Rome. He used profit from illegal activities to build a massive transport company that dominated the trucking of goods for thousands of Chinese companies, police said.
Zhong had won a near-monopoly in distribution through threats and violence against Chinese company owners, anti-mafia prosecutors said. The investigation, called ""China Truck"", began in 2011. 
The operation broke up ""a dangerous organization that had used force to take control of trucking, and was financed by its illegal activities,"" Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in a statement.
Italy has a long history of home-grown organized crime, including the Sicilian Mafia and the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta, but immigration to Europe has opened the way for foreign crime groups to take root, including the Nigerian and Chinese mafias.
""Being able to shed light on mafia character of this group is almost incredible,"" Federico Cafiero De Raho, Italy's chief anti-mafia prosecutor, told a news conference. ""It's quite unusual to be able to identify a complex Chinese mafia organization.""
Investigators said Zhong emerged the winner of a conflict between rival Chinese gangs in which some 40 people were thought to have been murdered between 2005-2010. They estimated the group's business activities were worth ""hundreds of millions of euros"".
Apart from the arrests, prosecutors seized eight companies and an equal number of vehicles and ""a few"" millions of euros.

KIEV (Reuters) - The World Bank is encouraged by signs from the Ukrainian president that a draft law to create an anti-corruption court could be revised following international criticism, the lender's Ukraine director Satu Kahkonen said.
Ukraine's Western backers want the authorities to establish an independent court to handle corruption cases as a condition for more aid. Critics of President Petro Poroshenko accuse him of dragging his heels over establishing such a court. 
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund wrote to Poroshenko's office this month to express concern over a draft law they said did not meet the recommendations of a European rights and legal watchdog.
On Tuesday, Poroshenko told foreign diplomats the legislation could be amended after a first vote in parliament to make it more effective. 
""I very much welcome that statement,"" Kahkonen told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday. 
""Looking forward, whether I'm going to be optimistic or pessimistic, will depend very much on what is going to happen with the anti-corruption court and land reform,"" she said, when asked about the general outlook for Ukraine.
Establishing the court and lifting a moratorium on the sale of farmland are among reforms Ukraine must implement to qualify for further World Bank funding worth $800 million.
""These are two major reforms that many people are watching - investors are watching. These are two reforms that actually do matter for investment and for investors to come in and for growth to really take off in Ukraine,"" Kahkonen said.
Since a 2013-14 pro-European uprising, Ukraine has received over $5 billion from the World Bank and $8.4 billion from the IMF among other backers.
However disbursement was held up last year over perceived backtracking on reform commitments. Kahkonen said the World Bank had been working with the government on land reform over the past year, reviewing and providing technical assistance with draft legislation.
The issue is sensitive in Ukraine - once the bread basket of the Soviet Union - and many doubt the authorities would risk political capital by pushing the reform through parliament ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections in 2019.
""The preparatory work for land reform has quietly moved forward and is very well-advanced,"" Kahkonen said.
""The indications we had prior to the holidays was that this would be on the government agenda in early 2018,"" she said, recommending the government improve the way it got its message across to the public to dispel widespread misconceptions about the reform.
She said the World Bank was also still working with the government to address international backers' concerns about a landmark pension reform passed last October.

PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's record on human rights in his first year in office has been a ""disaster"" and has encouraged oppression by authoritarian leaders from China to Russia, the head of Human Rights Watch said in an interview on Wednesday. 
Kenneth Roth was speaking ahead of HRW's annual report launch in Paris, where he said French President Emmanuel Macron needed to fill a void with countries like Britain, which was distracted by Brexit, and the United States which was largely absent from the rights' landscape.
""Trump has been a disaster for the human rights movement, in part because he seems to have this insatiable desire to embrace people who have been able to govern without the checks and balances of democracy."" Roth said in an interview. 
""Trump seems to wish he could do that himself. That makes it much harder for the human rights movement to uphold human rights, because we gain our power from our ability to shame abusive governments."" 
Roth singled out Russia and China for conducting an ""intense crackdown"" on opponents and, after Trump was reported to have described African countries as ""shitholes"", said the U.S. president had ""found political advantage in acting as a racist"".
The New York-based group had issued its report in Paris to underline Macron's role in curbing the rise of the far-right in Europe, Roth said, but also to send the French leader a signal that the world was expecting more from him on rights.
Since he came to power in May, Macron has been criticised for only raising human rights with countries when there was little at stake for France, but shying away when its national interests could be hurt.
While Macron has been forceful with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan and Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro, he has shown weaknesses elsewhere, Roth said.
He cited Macron's visit to China, where he barely spoke of rights, his failure to support an investigation of Saudi actions in Yemen, and his telling Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi that he would not lecture him on human rights. 

""It's easy to defend human rights when it's free, when there's no real cost in doing so. But when you're dealing with Chinese or Saudi (business) contracts, or you're dealing with Egypt's potential assistance in fighting terrorism ... Macron has been more resistant to standing up for human rights.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. military's Pacific command called China a disruptive power in the Indo-Pacific region on Thursday and urged countries in the area to build capabilities and work together to ensure free and open seas.
Admiral Harry Harris, known for his combative views on Beijing's South China Sea expansion, was speaking at a security conference sponsored by the Indian government, where he was joined by the chief of staff, joint staff of Japan and the head of the Indian navy. 
The three countries - the United States, Japan and India - have grown increasingly concerned about China's assertive military posture in the region and sought to draw closer, with Australia, in a ""quad"" of liberal democracies.
""I believe the reality is that China is a disruptive transitional force in the Indo-Pacific, they are owner of the 'trust deficit' that we all have spent the last hour talking about,"" Harris said referring to the discussions of the panel.
The United States has criticized China’s construction of islands and build-up of military facilities in the South China Sea, saying they could be used to restrict free nautical movement.
China says there is no issue with freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and opposes efforts to use it as an ""excuse"" to infringe on China’s sovereignty and security interests.
Harris said China's actions had cause disquiet in countries stretching from the Philippines to Malaysia and Vietnam. He said it was time countries took firmer measures to ensure maritime stability. 
""We must be willing to take the tough decisions to ensure the Indo-Pacific region and the Indian Ocean remain free, open and prosperous,"" he said. ""This requires like-minded nations to develop capacities, leverage each other's capabilities.""
Harris had earlier proposed joint patrols with the Indian navy in the Indian Ocean. New Delhi, worried about a backlash from China, said no such actions were planned. 
But India has begun holding trilateral naval exercises with the U.S. and Japan that military experts say could eventually include Australia as well.

The United Nations estimates that more than two million people have been displaced by the war, which intensified in 2015 when an Arab coalition intervened to try to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power after the Houthis forced him into exile.
The war has killed more than 10,000 people, crippled the economy, caused a cholera epidemic that has killed nearly 2,000 people and pushed the country to the verge of famine.
The Saudi-led coalition denies Houthi accusations that it targets civilians or civilian property in its operations. Riyadh sees the Houthis as a proxy militia linked to regional rival Iran. Both Iran and the Houthis deny any military cooperation.

Transparency International ranks Romania as one of the European Union's most corrupt states and Brussels keeps its justice system under special monitoring, although it has praised magistrates for their efforts to root out high-level graft.
The report found that Romania had fully met only two of the 13 recommendations GRECO made the year before. They included making the legal process more transparent, introducing stricter criteria for lawmakers to prevent conflict of interest and clarifying the conditions of their immunity from prosecution.
""The legislative process remains an area of particular concern for GRECO given the persisting controversies and allegations of improper consultation, the excessive use of expedited procedure, and the lack of transparency,"" it said.
In December, lawmakers from the ruling Social Democrat party and its junior coalition partner, ALDE, used their absolute majority to approve a judicial overhaul that critics said would limit the independence of the judiciary.
The overhaul was criticized by the European Commission, the U.S. State Department, diplomats and the country's centrist president, and it triggered massive street protests. 
The Social Democrats also filed various new changes to the criminal code that would decriminalize several graft offences, their second attempt in a year to weaken a crackdown on corruption. Debates on the changes will start when parliament reconvenes in February. 
Romania's anti-corruption prosecution unit has sent 72 members of parliament to trial since 2006. The speakers of parliament’s lower house and senate are both currently on trial in separate cases.

Reversing decades of U.S. policy, Trump in early December recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and set in motion the process of moving the embassy from Tel Aviv, imperiling Middle East peace efforts and upsetting the Arab world and Western allies alike. 
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last month the embassy move was “probably no earlier than three years out, and that’s pretty ambitious,” a timeframe that administration officials have attributed to the logistics of finding and securing a site as well as arranging housing for diplomats.
Jerusalem is home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally, as the capital of their future state.
Netanyahu, according to Israeli reporters traveling with him on a trip to India, said on Wednesday: “My solid assessment is that it will go much faster than you think - within a year from now.”
Asked about Netanyahu’s comment, Trump told Reuters in an interview that was not the case. ""By the end of the year? We’re talking about different scenarios - I mean obviously that would be on a temporary basis. We’re not really looking at that. That's no.“
Trump – whose decision on the embassy move fulfilled a campaign pledge - promised, however, that it would be a “a beautiful embassy but not one that costs $1.2 billion,” referring to what he says was the cost of the new U.S. embassy in London.
Trump last week canceled a trip to London to open the new diplomatic mission, blaming his White House predecessor Barack Obama for selling off the old one for ""peanuts"" in a bad deal.

He acknowledged that the embassy move in Britain was agreed under former President George W. Bush but said it was built under Obama and “came out tremendously over budget.”

The idea is to help address Swiss reluctance to let the European Court of Justice (ECJ) act as a referee, which is anathema to the far-right Swiss People's Party, parliament's largest. Many conservatives are wary of giving ""foreign judges"" such power.
Swiss officials were still considering the offer, the sources said.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said during a visit in November that Brussels wanted concrete progress on a new treaty by spring 2018, while Swiss officials have said they cannot accept an artificial deadline.
The issue is politically fraught ahead of elections in both Switzerland and the EU in 2019, effectively giving Juncker until the second half of this year to strike a deal that could cement ties now governed by a patchwork of 120 bilateral accords.
Relations soured last month when Bern promised retaliation over what it called unacceptable limitations on Swiss stock exchanges' access to the EU single market. 
Brussels linked future bourse access to progress on the new treaty, which would have Switzerland automatically adopt EU law on the single market, a crucial outlet for Swiss exports.
The row threatened to set back ties that had been thawing after the Swiss parliament in late 2016 skirted voters' demand for immigration quotas for EU citizens.
As part of the EU's offer for settling disputes, the ECJ would still have to give an advisory opinion in rows over how to interpret EU laws governing the single market, but other areas could fall under the aegis of the arbitration court.
""You could maybe circumvent the trauma of foreign judges,"" one source said, referring to a traditional Swiss fear of erosion of sovereignty.
The Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper, citing unidentified sources, said the proposed new panel would have three members, with each side naming one judge and the third agreed by mutual consent.
These experts would rule on disputes that the existing joint commission in charge of monitoring bilateral ties could not settle amicably. Should one side remain dissatisfied by a ruling, it could unilaterally adopt countervailing measures that would again be subject to an arbitration ruling.

The film ""Padmaavat"" ran into trouble after groups critical of the project accused its director, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, of distorting history by portraying a Muslim ruler as the ""lover"" of Queen Padmavati of the Hindu Rajput warrior clan.
""We direct that there shall be a stay of operation on the notification and orders issued,"" the judges said in their interim order, which barred similar measures by other states.
Indian films that touch upon the historical relationships of Hindus, India's majority religion, and Muslim leaders are often controversial.
At least four Indian states, among them central Madhya Pradesh, had banned the film, citing security threats, despite its clearance by a censor panel, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC).
A school in Madhya Pradesh was vandalized this week by protesters after students danced to a song from the film, which is set to open in theaters on Jan 25.
Despite the scrapping of the ban, fears of protests, particularly by right-wing groups, such as the Shri Rajput Karni Sena, still overshadow screenings. 
The group's leader, Sukhdev Singh, told reporters it would not allow the film to be released, while other groups have threatened to burn down theaters that show the film.
""The movie should not run,"" domestic media quoted Singh as saying. ""The public should enforce a curfew at cinema halls.""
Members of hardline Hindu fringe groups, as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, have criticized the film.
The censor panel cleared the film late last year, suggesting modifications such as changing the name to ""Padmaavat"" from ""Padmavati"" to reflect that the source material was a poem, rather than actual historical events.
Based on a poem by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, the film tells the story of Padmavati and the Mughal conqueror Alaudin Khilji.

LIMA (Reuters) - In his 2015 trip to Bolivia, Pope Francis asked for forgiveness for the ""grave sins"" committed against native people in the Americas in the name of the Catholic Church.
In Peru this week, he will be asked to go a step further by making amends for the Church's 16th century takeover of the most sacred temple in the Incan Empire: Coricancha.
Practitioners of indigenous Andean rituals want his help securing broader access to the temple in the Peruvian city of Cusco, the former capital of the Incan Empire and the heart of a thriving tourism industry built on the region's rich pre-Colombian past.
The Spanish demolished much of the original temple of Coricancha after seizing its gold some 500 years ago, building the Santo Domingo Church on top of its ruins as part of the widespread practice at the time of transforming sacred native sites into Catholic ones.
The sophisticated stonemasonry of the Incas is still featured in the foundation of the Church of Santo Domingo, which charges tourists to visit Coricancha.
Hatun Ayllu, one of the groups that signed a letter delivered to the pope's representatives before his visit to Peru starting on Thursday, said allowing native rituals to resume regularly in Coricancha would turn papal gestures of regret into atonement for past misdeeds.
""Cusco was conquered by the sword and the cross,"" Hatun Ayllu representative Enrique Riveros said. ""But reflecting on it isn't enough. It's time to return to indigenous people what belongs to them.""
The Church of Santo Domingo and the pope's representatives in Peru did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
While Francis has asked for forgiveness for wrongdoing ""during the so-called conquest of America,"" he has not explicitly expressed regret for the evangelization of indigenous people.
Riveros and other believers in native gods gathered on a sacred site in Lima this week to blow on sea shells and make offerings to the Earth in a tradition that has survived despite Peru's Catholic majority.
'CENTER OF THE INCAN UNIVERSE'
The request for increased access to Coricancha is part of growing calls for Francis, seen by many as the pope who has been most sympathetic to the plight of indigenous people, to help tackle problems from mining pollution to land disputes that have disrupted native ways of life.
In a copy of the letter seen by Reuters, Francis is asked to help establish the ""shared use, administration and property"" of Coricancha. ""Do not allow, Holy Father, dear little brother of ours, the perpetuation of this injustice against our peoples,"" it says.
Riveros said that while Hatun Ayllu and others can celebrate an Incan sun festival in the temple, they have spent the past nine years performing monthly Andean rituals in a public space alongside Coricancha.
""How is it possible that it's 2018 and we still can't perform our rituals there?"" said Riveros. ""The Church has the Vatican. Well, our Vatican is Coricancha.""
Once filled with gold, Coricancha was believed to be the place where the four quarters of the world met under the Incan Empire, which stretched across large swaths of South America.
""It was literally the center of the Incan universe,"" said Ronald Elward, a Dutch historian of Peru. ""The walls were plated in gold. The Spanish were quite astonished when they saw it.""
Hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists flock to Cusco every year to visit the region's Machu Picchu ruins and other historic Incan sites now administered by local governments or the Church.

Francis is not planning to visit Cusco but will meet with tribal leaders in the Amazonian region of Madre de Dios on Friday. Earlier this week, he met with indigenous Mapuche in Chile, where some say the pope's ceremony was held on seized ancestral land.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe will hold elections in four to five months, a newspaper on Thursday quoted President Emmerson Mnangagwa as saying, the first time since independence the southern African state will conduct a vote that does not involve Robert Mugabe.
The vote, a litmus test of Mnangagwa's democratic credentials, will be crucial to unlocking badly needed financial assistance and repairing relations with Western powers and international financial institutions. 
Mnangagwa, a protege of Mugabe, came to power in November after a de-facto military coup when the 93-year-old was forced to resign after the military confined him to his Harare mansion.
It was the culmination of a power struggle between Mnangagwa and former first lady Grace Mugabe, who was being groomed by her husband as his potential successor.
Now Mnangagwa, 75, is under pressure himself to deliver on the economy and show that he is breaking with the policies of Mugabe, whose 37-year rule since independence in 1980 turned a promising country into a basket case and international pariah.
He promised the elections for the presidency, parliament and local government would be peaceful and told business leaders their investments would be secure and their profits safe. 
""Zimbabwe is going for elections in four to five months' time and we have to preach peace, peace and peace because we know it is good for us and we have no doubt that we will have peaceful elections,"" Mnangagwa was quoted as saying by the official Herald newspaper during an official trip to Mozambique.
""We will ensure that Zimbabwe delivers free, credible, fair and indisputable elections to ensure Zimbabwe engages the world as a qualified democratic state.""
Under the constitution, Zimbabwe should hold elections between July 22 and Aug. 22, but parliament can choose to dissolve itself, triggering an earlier vote. The ruling ZANU-PF holds a two-thirds majority in parliament.
Since 2000, elections in Zimbabwe have been marred by political violence and disputes.
But the 2018 vote could catch the opposition flat-footed.
Mnangagwa's main rival Morgan Tsvangirai is suffering from cancer, which has helped expose divisions in his Movement for Democratic Change party as officials scramble to take over leadership of the party.
The economy is suffering acute shortages of foreign currency, increases in prices of basic goods, high unemployment and low levels of foreign investment, making it the biggest challenge for Mnangagwa.
At a function ahead of next week's World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Mnangagwa said the extent of economic problems required Zimbabweans to work together as he promised to safeguard all investments in the country.
""All investments will be safe and secure in Zimbabwe. Foreign investors will be able to repatriate profits,"" he told a gathering of government officials and business leaders.

He said he was going to the Davos meetings, the such trip first by any Zimbabwean leader, to ""dispel the perception"" that Zimbabwe is ""an isolated island"".

1239,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>",Syrians displaced by Idlib assault take shelter near Turkey,"By Dominic Evans
KELBIT CAMP, Syria (Reuters) - When fighting drove Bahr Diab from his home in southern Idlib last month, it was the fourth time he and his family had been displaced since the start of Syria's seemingly endless conflict.
From his pre-war home on the Lebanese border, Diab moved first east and then north searching for safety, finally taking shelter near Turkey where he hopes his wife and four children will be safe from air strikes and ground assaults.
""Every time I get to a new place I build a house, but we are forced to leave it and move on,"" he said at a makeshift camp a few miles from the border, where hundreds of people endure the mud and winter weather.
""That's my tent over there, that's my home. Four homes later we decided to settle for blankets for winter.""
Diab is part of a wave of Syrians fleeing an offensive by Syrian government forces and their allies, which several people at the Kelbit camp said involved the heaviest bombardment they had seen in nearly seven years of conflict.
The Idlib area is the largest remaining opposition-held territory in Syria, its population swelled by insurgents and civilians retreating from shrinking rebel strongholds elsewhere. The scale of this latest upheaval has overwhelmed local authorities in Islamist-controlled Idlib.
They say around 36,000 families have been uprooted, nearly half of which have fled to the Turkish border region. The United Nations said this week it had tracked 212,000 displacements in the last month alone, though some may have been counted more than once on their journey.
Neighboring Turkey, already hosting 3 million refugees, says that further fighting could trigger another mass exodus. But it has built a wall along the frontier and tightened control at crossings, leaving tens of thousands of Syrians near the border with nowhere left to flee.
Diab, who reached Kelbit three weeks ago, said people were suffering from the cold, wet weather and sickness was rife. But compared to his last home in the Idlib town of Sinjar, where people lived in daily fear of air strikes, they felt secure. 
""The Turkish border region is safer,"" he said. ""Where we were before, you would hear planes 20 times a day. The children and women were terrified."" 
""FIVE FAMILIES TO A TENT""
Another man displaced from the Sinjar region said the ground and air assault by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, who is supported by Russia and Iran, was the most ferocious he had experienced.
""There were situations when you would get civilians killed, but not like this,"" said the 43-year-old father of six, who gave his name only as Abdulhamid. ""This is hysteria at an insane level. It's the first time I've seen civilians being targeted in schools, mosques, entire districts.""
Abdulhamid said his home in Sinjar had been destroyed and he had lost contact with relatives during his three-day trek to the border. ""My cousins, I know nothing about them. My sisters, brothers and wives, I don't know where they are"".
Next to the canvas and blue tarpaulin structures of the improvised camp, Turkey's Red Crescent has built 500 new tents which will soon be ready for families to move into.
But Hassan Darwish, an official with the local authority running the opposition-controlled Idlib region, said they desperately needed more food and shelter to support the displaced population.
He said there were 1,300 displaced families in Kelbit area, 300 of which could not be housed at the camp. In the wider border region, he said there were 71,000 displaced families.
The World Food Programme is helping feed tens of thousands, but WFP provisions cover less than half the needs, Darwish said.
""People who have been displaced from all the governorates (in Syria) have nowhere apart from this region. But this region ... cannot absorb any more people,"" he said. ""In several camps, you find five or six families in one tent.""
The overcrowding may only get worse if the army and its militia allies continue to advance from the south, eating further into opposition areas.
Rakkan Khalil, who said he was first uprooted by the violence six years ago, said that given the chance he would cross the border to Turkey, but he saw no way to make the short trip with his wife, four sons and two daughters. 
""They've closed the borders, it's hard for us,"" he said.
At the approach to the Bab al-Hawa crossing from Syria to Turkey, a large sign in the center of the road encapsulates the sense of entrapment and resignation in the Islamist-controlled region.
""All crossings and roads may be closed,"" it reads. ""Except the path to God.""

TEKNAF, Bangladesh (Reuters) - More than 100 Rohingya Muslims have crossed into Bangladesh from Myanmar since Wednesday, with the latest refugees saying army operations are continuing in troubled Rakhine State, raising doubts about plans to send back 655,500 who had already fled.
Scores more were waiting to cross the Naf river that forms the border, even as Dhaka prepares to start repatriating next week some of the Rohingya who have escaped from what the Myanmar military calls counter-insurgency operations since late August.
Bangladesh and Myanmar said on Tuesday they had agreed to complete the return of the refugees within two years, with the process due to begin on Jan. 23.
The United Nations has described the Myanmar military operations in the northern part of Rakhine, launched in response to attacks by militants on police and soldiers on Aug. 25, as a classic case of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya.
One boat crossed the Naf river carrying 53 people early Wednesday, and another boat arrived from the Bay of Bengal with 60 people Thursday morning, according to a Bangladeshi intelligence official in Dhaka, and aid officials at the sprawling Rohingya camp in Kutupalong, near Cox's Bazar.
Those waiting on the Myanmar side to cross were stuck there because they did not have enough money to pay the boatmen, the recent arrivals said. They said they paid between 30,000 and 40,000 kyat ($20-$30) a person for the night-time trips on rickety boats to Teknaf, in the southernmost part of Bangladesh. 
Most of the recent arrivals said they came from Sein Yin Pyin village in Buthidaung district, and escaped because they feared they would be picked up by the military if they left their homes to go to work.
LOOTING IN THE FOREST
Mohammad Ismail, 48, and four others said two weeks ago they saw a dead body hanging by a rope in a forest where Ismail used to collect wood to sell at the market.
""After this I never went to the forest again, and all my money was gone, so my family had nothing to eat for three days,"" said Ismail.
Myanmar Police Colonel Myo Thu Soe, spokesman for the military-controlled Home Affairs Ministry, said ""there's no clearance operation going on in the villages"". But, he added, ""security forces are still trying to take control of the area"" in northern Rakhine. He declined to elaborate. 
Government spokesman Zaw Htay did not respond to requests for comment.  
Myanmar's military said in October that it was withdrawing soldiers from western Rakhine state.
Villagers from Sein Yin Pyin said a group of soldiers caught around 200 of them sleeping in the forest on their journey to Bangladesh and looted them of their belongings, including rice, phones, solar chargers and money. 
They were stopped again later that day at a beach in Dongkhali village, where around 20 soldiers recorded video of them on their smartphones, while questioning the group and urging them to stay.
""Why are you leaving? You are safe here, don't go. We will give you a car, go back to your village. If you leave, you will not be able to come back again,"" Arif Ullah, 20, said the soldiers told the group. 
More than two dozen refugees that Reuters interviewed recounted a similar version of events.
""First their men looted us, and then they stopped us again to ask why we were leaving,"" said Umme Habiba, 15. ""We left because we were scared.""
Fayazur Rahman, a 33-year-old labourer from southern Buthidaung, said 12 soldiers barged into his home two weeks ago and sexually assaulted his 18-year-old sister. ""Day by day, things were getting worse,"" he said.
Reuters could not independently confirm the accounts the new arrivals gave. Myanmar has denied most allegations of abuses leveled against its security forces during the operations in Rakhine. 
REPATRIATION START DATE?
In Dhaka, a senior foreign ministry official told Reuters that the deadline of next Tuesday for starting the Rohingya repatriation to Myanmar ""may not be possible"". 
""The return has to be voluntary, safe and dignified,"" said the official, who was part of a 14-member team at talks with Myanmar this week about the repatriation. 
He said Myanmar would take back 1,500 Rohingya a week, ""although our demand was 15,000 per week"", adding the number could be ramped up over the next few months.
They would sheltered in a temporary transit camp in Myanmar before being moved to ""houses as per their choices"". 

""They (Myanmar) will create all kind of provisions including for their livelihood. We want to make sure there's a sustainable solution to the crisis,"" the official said.

Buhari, 75, was speaking in a radio interview. He was elected in 2015 but spent much of 2017 in Britain being treated for an undisclosed ailment that left him visibly weakened. Some have questioned his willingness or ability to run again.
Adebayo Shittu, Nigeria's minister of communications who played a prominent role in Buhari's 2015 campaign, has said he would chair a group to support the re-election of the president and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.
Such campaigns by supporters often pave the way in Nigeria for a president to declare his intention to run again.

The largest Muslim rebel group, Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), signed a peace deal with the government in 2014 to end nearly 50 years of conflict that has killed more than 120,000 people and displaced 2 million.
Central to resolving that is the passage of the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), which would create a new autonomous area in the Mindanao region offering more political and economic power. Duterte is a staunch supporter of the plan.
""I am urging everybody to understand, it's about time the historical injustices committed to them corrected,"" Duterte said during the launch of a bank for Filipino overseas workers.
""If nothing happens to the BBL, there will be war in Mindanao.""
He said he could not control rebel groups if they take up arms again and seek an independent state in the south.
The Muslim parts of Mindanao are already fraught with security problems and a collapse of the peace process with the MILF would be one of the biggest setbacks of Duterte's presidency.
Martial law is in place in Mindanao until the end of the year to allow the military to tackle rebel groups loyal to Islamic State, some of which held parts of southern Marawi City through five months of war with the government last year.
The MILF is bitterly opposed to Islamic extremists and has been collaborating with government troops to fight a radical faction of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.

He said he wanted the BBL passed before Congress focuses its attention on changing the constitution to create a federal system, one of his key election platforms.

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Gunmen in Pakistan shot and killed two women working on a polio eradication campaign on Thursday, the latest in a string of attacks on efforts to protect children from the crippling and sometimes deadly disease.
No group claimed responsibility for the killings in the southwestern city of Quetta but such attacks have in the past been carried out by Islamist militants, who oppose the immunization of children as un-Islamic.
Sakina Bibi, 50, and her 20-year-old daughter, Alizah, were giving immunization drops to children when two gunmen riding on a motorcycle shot them, said police official Naseebullah Khan.
""They died on their way to a hospital,"" said Khan.
The women were taking part in an immunization campaign in five districts of Baluchistan province, Khan said. Quetta is the provincial capital.
Pakistan is one of only three countries in the world, along with Afghanistan and Nigeria, that suffers from endemic polio, a childhood virus that can cause paralysis or death.
Efforts to eradicate the disease have been undermined by opposition from militants, who say immunization is a foreign ploy to sterilize Muslim children or a cover for Western spies.
In 2015, a suicide bomber killed 15 people outside a vaccination center in Quetta in an attack claimed by the Pakistani Taliban and another militant group, Jundullah.
Suspicion of immunization drives was compounded by the hunt for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, architect of the 2001 attacks on the United States.
A Pakistani doctor has been accused of using a fake vaccination campaign to collect DNA samples that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was believed to have been using to try to track down bin Laden.
Bin Laden was killed in a covert raid by U.S. special forces in 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where he had been hiding.
Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi condemned the Thursday attack and ordered an investigation.
""Polio teams are rendering a huge national service to save our children from the crippling disease. Attack on these dedicated workers, risking their lives for their nation, is an attack on our future,"" Abbasi's office said in a statement. 
In another attack on Thursday, unidentified gunmen killed two policemen on patrol in Quetta, police said.

Baluchistan, a strategically important region bordering Iran as well as Afghanistan, is plagued by violence by Sunni Islamist sectarian groups linked to the Taliban, al Qaeda and Islamic State. It also has an indigenous ethnic Baloch insurgency fighting against the central government.

The bus was traveling along a road in the remote Aktobe region that links the Russian city of Samara to Shymkent, a city in southern Kazakhstan close to the Uzbek border.
The bus was traveling from southern Kazakhstan to Russia's Kazan, Kazakh officials said. The route is widely used to transport Uzbek workers to and from Russia where they often take work on building sites. 
Only five people managed to escape the burning vehicle, the interior ministry's emergencies department said in a statement.
The ministry said the apparent accident had happened at 10.30 a.m. (0430 GMT), but provided no details about its cause. It said senior government officials would investigate the matter.
A photograph posted online from the site showed the bus completely burnt out. Video footage also posted on the Web showed it positioned diagonally across a two-lane freeway in the middle of a snow-covered steppe, in flames and emitting heavy black smoke.
Uzbekistan's foreign ministry said in a statement its embassy staff were en route to the area, roughly midway between the Russian border and the Aral Sea.
Separately, Uzbekistan's Emergencies Ministry said it was sending a plane with its own team of doctors and rescuers to the site.

Last October, another Kazakh-operated bus carrying over 50 Uzbeks was hit by a train in Russia after getting stuck on the tracks; 17 people died in that accident.

1249,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>","Czech PM Babis, wary of who becomes president, rushes to form new government","By Jason Hovet
PRAGUE (Reuters) - New Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis is rushing to form a new government, possibly by the end of February, before a new presidential term begins.
The two candidates on the run-off presidential vote on Jan. 26-27 have diametrically opposed views on Babis' fitness for the premiership.
Babis' minority cabinet lost a parliamentary confidence vote this week, mainly because he faces allegations that, as a businessman a decade ago, he abused European Union subsidies. He denies this.
Babis, whose ANO party won three times as many votes as its nearest rival in a parliamentary election last October, said in an interview with the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes on Thursday that a political crisis could arise if he does not get a second chance.
The situation is complicated by a run-off presidential vote on Jan. 26-27 in which incumbent Milos Zeman, who has promised to allow Babis a second attempt, faces a tough challenger in academic Jiri Drahos, who says it would be unacceptable to have a prime minister facing police charges.
Babis was charged in the case but regained immunity from prosecution when he was re-elected to parliament. Lawmakers will vote on Friday whether to lift that immunity and are expected to do so.
""Certainly if we do not get a second attempt from President Zeman and the winner was Mr Drahos, who has said he would not nominate me, destabilization and a crisis could arise,"" Babis told the newspaper.
In a separate interview with the daily Pravo, published on Thursday, Drahos said he would advise Babis to step aside to help resolve the standoff and would consult leaders of political parties to find out what government could be formed with majority backing in parliament. 
Babis said ANO was holding talks with three parties about a coalition - the Civic Democrats, Social Democrats and Christian Democrats - all of whom insist the ANO leader stand aside. Babis has said such a coalition is a possibility but his party rejects the stepping-down option.
Babis said he would also lead talks with the far-right, anti-NATO and anti-EU SPD party and the far-left Communists for potential support of an ANO minority cabinet.
The anti-establishment ANO won elections with pledges to fight political corruption, raise public investment, modernize government and run the state more efficiently. 
Babis and Zeman - among the most popular politicians in the largely eurosceptic country that has battled the EU over its rejection of taking in migrants - have formed an uneasy alliance. 
Babis backs Zeman in the presidential vote but after the first round said the president should distance himself from some advisers and clearly state he is not aiming to re-orientate the country to eastern powers at the expense of western allies.

Zeman has been a polarizing figure in his first term for his leanings to far-right views on migration, brash style and focus on building relations with China and Russia.

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 04:13AM ET</span>","After Trump denial, Netanyahu clarifies remarks on timeframe for U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took a step back on Thursday from comments, challenged by U.S. President Donald Trump, that envisioned a one-year timeframe for the planned relocation of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.
An official in Netanyahu's office said the prime minister recognized that construction of a new embassy will take years but believes Washington is considering ""interim measures that could result in an embassy opening much faster"".
The official, who declined to be named, did not define those steps or mention any dates for a Jerusalem embassy to begin operating. In the past, Israeli media have speculated that, before a building is ready, the U.S. ambassador would operate part of the time out of a temporary location in Jerusalem.
Reversing decades of U.S. policy, Trump in early December recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and set in motion the process of moving the embassy from Tel Aviv, imperiling Middle East peace efforts and upsetting the Arab world and Western allies alike.
Netanyahu, according to Israeli reporters traveling with him on a trip to India, said on Wednesday: ""My solid assessment is that it will go much faster than you think - within a year from now.""
Asked about Netanyahu’s comment, Trump told Reuters in an interview that was not the case. ""By the end of the year? We’re talking about different scenarios - I mean obviously that would be on a temporary basis. We’re not really looking at that. That's no.""
The Israeli official, responding to Trump's remarks, said: ""The president and the prime minister are not saying anything different"".
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last month the embassy move was ""probably no earlier than three years out, and that’s pretty ambitious"", a timeframe that administration officials have attributed to the logistics of finding and securing a site as well as arranging housing for diplomats.

Jerusalem is home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally, as the capital of their future state.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A young protest leader calling for Hong Kong's independence from China appeared in court on the rare charge of rioting on Thursday as two co-defendants failed to show up, the latest case highlighting a new generation of opposition to Chinese rule.
The former head of radical group Hong Kong Indigenous, Edward Leung, 26, faces four charges, including rioting and incitement to riot, for his role in a 2016 Lunar New Year protest that turned violent when masked activists tossed bricks at police and burned trash cans.
Five other protesters also appeared in court on rioting and other charges.
Rioting carries a maximum jail term of 10 years. The High Court had issued arrest warrants for two other activists, including protest leader Ray Wong, who failed to appear in court. 
Activist circles say Wong has left Hong Kong while a teenage female protester is in Taiwan. 
High Court Judge Anthea Pang issued an order that prohibits the reporting of details of the case before a jury is chosen.
About 130 people were wounded in the clashes that were labeled a riot by then Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying.
The overnight demonstration began as a rally to support street hawkers but erupted into anger toward what protesters perceive as mainland China's encroachment into the city's autonomy and culture.
When a months-long ""Occupy"" street occupation failed to wrestle more democratic rights from Beijing's Communist Party rulers in 2014, a generation of young activists began pushing for outright independence, a red line for China. 
Dozens of young protesters have been jailed for ""unlawful assembly"" and other charges. Joshua Wong, 21, the public face of Hong Kong's democratic movement, was jailed for three months on Wednesday for refusing to leave a 2014 protest site.
Last year, three protesters including a University of Hong Kong student were jailed for three years for rioting, the first convictions on this charge since hundreds broke into a fight at a drug addiction treatment center in 2000. 
The financial hub was promised a high degree of autonomy when Britain handed its colony back to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, but activists see evidence of growing interference by Beijing. 
Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have repeatedly condemned calls for independence, citing the city's mini-constitution, the ""Basic Law"", which stipulates that the city is ""an inalienable part"" of China.

The hearing continues on Monday.

His administration obtained an ""excellent"" net satisfaction rating of +70, a rise of 12 points from September's ""very good"" level based on a Dec. 8-16 poll, the Social Weather Stations (SWS) said on Thursday.
Political analyst Ramon Casiple said the latest survey showed Duterte's popularity had not diminished, despite drawing international criticism for his bloody war on drugs and human rights record.
""It is related to his actions, because he implemented what he promised, starting with his anti-drugs campaign, and then the Build, Build, Build infrastructure projects, anti-corruption efforts, and now the charter change to shift to federalism,"" he said.
Seventy-nine percent of adult Filipinos said they were satisfied against 9 percent dissatisfied, resulting in a net satisfaction rating of +70, SWS said in a statement. Twelve percent were neither satisfied or dissatisfied.
The figures mirrored the same trend in Duterte's trust rating, which bounced back to ""excellent"" in December in the SWS survey, from ""very high"" three months before.
The Duterte administration's rating exceeded the previous record of +66 achieved by the administration of former President Benigno Aquino in June 2013.
It got ""very good"" scores in five of 18 ""performance subjects"" rated, such as fighting terrorism, helping the poor, infrastructure development, foreign relations and providing jobs, SWS said.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said, ""This excellent public confidence will continue to motivate the president and his team to continue working hard to lay down the foundations for a peaceful and prosperous nation.""

The administration got ""good"" scores in 11 subjects, including defending territorial rights and protecting human rights, but scored low in fighting inflation and solving the traffic problem, the SWS said.

He made the televised comments during a business breakfast ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos next week. 
Ramaphosa will lead the South African delegation there and said his ""sole purpose"" in going there was to ""sell the country"" as an investment destination. 
Ramaphosa, who was elected president of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) last month, has been signaling a departure in style and governance from the scandal-plagued administration of President Jacob Zuma.
Zuma remains the head of state but faces a push from within the party to step down.
""The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has begun to move and we welcome that. We welcome the actions they are beginning to take and we encourage them to act with urgency,"" Ramaphosa said.
South Africa's state prosecutor said on Wednesday it had served a court order on consulting firm McKinsey relating to a 1.6 billion rand ($130 million) contract with state utility Eskom it worked on with Trillian, a local company then controlled by associates of Gupta family, who are close to Zuma.
Zuma and the Guptas have consistently denied any wrong doing.
""We want deal with the rot. It is unacceptable, totally unacceptable, that companies owned by the nation and set up to benefit the people, have been hijacked, captured, by certain interests,"" Ramaphosa said in some of his strongest comments yet on a widening graft scandal that has shaken investor confidence.

Ramaphosa also admitted that reversing damaging ratings downgrades would be a ""mammoth task"".

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen has appointed his son-in-law as deputy national police chief, in a move apparently aimed at consolidating his power ahead of an election this year.
Dy Vichea, who is married to Hun Sen's eldest daughter, Hun Mana, was promoted to the post on Tuesday, according to a government decree seen by Reuters on Thursday.
The appointment comes amid political tension in the Southeast Asian nation, including a government clamp down on critics, civil rights groups and independent media.
""Prime Minister Hun Sen aims to cement total control over Cambodian government and business, and appointing his son-in-law as deputy police chief is part of that ongoing effort,"" Phil Robertson, deputy director for Asia at the Human Rights Watch group, told Reuters.
Hun Sen celebrated 33 years in power on Sunday, and has spoken of staying on for many more years.
The main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, which had attracted the support of a new generation of voters not content with what they see as the corruption and nepotism that has stalked Cambodia's politics, was dissolved in November at the request of Hun Sen's government.
Exiled critics of Hun Sen recently said they had founded a new movement following the ban but signs of division have emerged over the new group.
Interior Ministry spokesman Khieu Sopheak defended Dy Vichea's appointment and compared it with how U.S. President Donald Trump made his daughter, Ivanka Trump, his informal adviser.
""There is no law that says we can't appoint him,"" Khieu Sopheak told Reuters. 
Business and government are entwined in Cambodia and the leadership and its family members control many of its biggest enterprises. 
National police chief Neth Savoeun is married to Hun Sen's niece. Hun Sen's daughter, Hun Mana, is chairwoman of the Kampuchea Thmey Daily and Bayon TV and Radio among at least a dozen other firms. 

Hun Sen's eldest son, Lieutenant-General Hun Manet, is deputy commander of the armed forces and has for years been seen as likely to follow in his father's footsteps and become a national leader.

Speaking to reporters while flying back to Washington from a visit to the North American West Coast, Tillerson did not make clear if he would formally open the controversial building.
This month, U.S. President Donald Trump canceled a trip to London to open the embassy scheduled for next month, saying he did not want to endorse a bad deal agreed by the Obama administration to sell the old one for ""peanuts.""
Asked whether he agreed with Trump that the new embassy was in an inferior location and if the move had been a mistake, Tillerson said: ""That’s a decision that’s already been taken, so I don’t think we need to revisit it.""
Asked if he planned to inaugurate the new embassy, Tillerson said: ""On any trip, I try to make a visit to the mission, have a town hall meeting, opportunity to engage with our local folks.""
He said he had discussed his London agenda with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who had been ""loading it up"" and added: ""We don’t have the details yet, but I hope to get by the embassy.""
The cancellation of Trump's trip was a further blow to relations between Britain and the United States, for long the closest of allies. More than a year into his presidency, Trump has yet to visit London, with many Britons vowing to protest against a man they see as crude, volatile and opposed to their values on a range of issues.
Tillerson rejected the suggestion that Trump might see Britain as less useful now it was embroiled in Brexit and other political issues.
""No, not at all,"" he said. ""I mean, we still have the special relationship with the British people. As you know, President Trump was supportive of the UK’s exit from the EU. He still thinks that was the right decision for them. 
""Britain needs to focus on those Brexit negotiations right now, which is really important to them, and I think the president realizes that’s where Prime Minister May really needs to focus her attention, working through, you know, the negotiation around the exit.""
The decision to move the U.S. embassy from Grosvenor Square (NYSE:SQ) in the upmarket Mayfair area of London to a site on the south bank of the Thames was agreed in 2008 under President George W. Bush.

ABOARD U.S. GOVERNMENT AIRCRAFT (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday the United States is getting evidence that international sanctions are ""really starting to hurt"" North Korea, even as he accused Russia of not implementing all of the measures.
U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in an interview earlier on Wednesday that Russia was helping North Korea evade international sanctions and that Pyongyang was getting closer every day to being able to deliver a long-range missile to the United States. 
Tillerson told reporters the Russian failure to comply with the U.N. measures ""primarily"" concerned fuel ""but some other areas potentially as well."" He did not provide details.
Nevertheless, Tillerson said he was confident the pressure would eventually bring North Korea to the negotiating table over its nuclear and missile programs. Pyongyang has carried out nuclear and missiles tests in defiance of U.N. and other sanctions.
""We are getting a lot of evidence that these sanctions are really starting to hurt,"" Tillerson said, citing intelligence and anecdotal evidence from defectors.
He said Japan told a conference on North Korea in Vancouver on Tuesday that more than 100 North Korean fishing boats had drifted into its waters and two-thirds of those aboard them had died.
""What they learned is that they are being sent out in the winter time because there's food shortages and they are being sent out to fish with inadequate fuel to get back,"" he said.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in had attributed North Korea's recent willingness to talk to South Korea to the pain of sanctions, Tillerson told an event at Stanford University in California.
But he later said he suspected Russia may not only be failing to implement some sanctions but ""frustrating"" some of the effort to press the North.
""It's apparent to us that they're not implementing all the sanctions and there's some evidence they may be frustrating some of the sanctions,"" Tillerson said aboard his aircraft while returning from Vancouver.
CHINESE PRESSURE
China did not attend the Vancouver meeting, where 20 nations agreed to step up sanctions pressure on the North, but Tillerson highlighted Beijing's role.
""We have never had Chinese support for sanctions like we're getting now,"" he said. ""Russia's a slightly different issue, but the Chinese have leaned in hard on the North Koreans.""
Asked whether there was a humanitarian concern that sanctions were hurting ordinary North Koreans, he said: ""That's a choice the regime's making. The regime gets to decide how they allocate their available resources.""
""We are not going to take any responsibility for the fact that he (North Korean leader Kim Jong Un) is choosing to make his own people suffer,"" Tillerson said.
Asked if he was concerned that South Korea might resume some humanitarian aid to North Korea as part of the resumption of North-South talks this month, thereby weakening sanctions, Tillerson said: ""Countries will have to make their own choice, but we would be very skeptical that aid that goes into the country will necessarily relieve the suffering of the people."" 
Tillerson said that, while North Korea had a record of seeking to drive a wedge between the United States and its allies through ""charm offensives,"" Washington was supportive of the North-South dialogue.
Tillerson said of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un: ""He knows how to reach me, if he wants to talk. But he's got to tell me he wants to talk. We're not going to chase him.""
He said he was confident the sides would eventually get to the negotiating table and he wanted North Korea to know that, when that happened, the United States had ""very, very strong military options standing behind me.""

The Trump administration has said repeatedly that all options are available, including military ones, in forcing North Korea to give up its development of nuclear missiles capable of reaching the United States, although it prefers a diplomatic solution.

HATAY, Turkey (Reuters) - Turkey said on Wednesday it would not hesitate to take action in Syria's Afrin district and other areas unless the United States withdrew support for a Kurdish-led force there, but Washington denied such plans and said ""some people misspoke"".
Turkish President Erdogan has repeatedly warned of an imminent incursion in Afrin after Washington said it would help the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by the Kurdish YPG militia, set up a new 30,000-strong border force.
The plan has infuriated Turkey, which considers the Syrian YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militant group, which has fought an insurgency in southeast Turkey since 1984. The PKK is considered a terrorist group by the European Union, Turkey and the United States.
Deputy Prime Minister and Government Spokesman Bekir Bozdag told reporters after a Cabinet meeting the planned U.S.-backed force posed a threat to Turkey's national security, territorial integrity and the safety of its citizens.
""We emphasized that such a step was very wrong,"" he said. ""Turkey has reached the limits of its patience. Nobody should expect Turkey to show more patience.""
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson denied that the United States had any intention of building a Syria-Turkey border force and said the issue had been ""misportrayed, misdescribed"". 
""Some people misspoke. We are not creating a border security force at all,"" Tillerson told reporters on board an aircraft taking him back to Washington from Vancouver, where he had attended a meeting on North Korea.
""I think it’s unfortunate that comments made by some left that impression,"" he said, without giving details. ""That is not what we’re doing.""
He said Turkish officials had been told U.S. intentions were only ""to ensure that local elements are providing security to
liberated areas"".
The Pentagon said in an earlier statement it was training ""internally focused"" Syrian fighters with a goal of preventing the Islamic State group's resurgence and ensuring Syrians displaced by the war could return to their communities.
""We are keenly aware of the security concerns of Turkey, our coalition partner and NATO ally. Turkey's security concerns are legitimate,"" it said.
TANKS DEPLOYED
Some Turkish troops have been in Syria for three months after entering northern Idlib province following an agreement with Russia and Iran to try to reduce fighting between pro-Syrian government forces and rebel fighters.
The observation posts which the Turkish army says it has established are close to the dividing line between Arab rebel-held land and Kurdish-controlled Afrin.
Turkey's National Security Council said earlier on Wednesday Turkey would not allow the formation of a ""terrorist army"" along its borders.
As the council met, a Reuters reporter witnessed the Turkish army deploying nine tanks to a military base just outside the city of Hatay, near the border with Afrin, to the west of the area where the border force is planned. That followed earlier reports of a military buildup in the area. 
""When the Turkish people and Turkish state's safety is in question, when it is necessary to remove risks and destroy threats, Turkey will do so without hesitation,"" Bozdag said.
On Monday, with relations between the United States and Turkey stretched close to breaking point, Erdogan threatened to ""strangle"" the planned U.S.-backed force in Syria ""before it's even born"".
Turkey and the United States, both allies in NATO, were on the same side for much of Syria's civil war, both supporting rebels fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But a decision by Washington to back Kurdish forces fighting against Islamic State in recent years has angered Ankara.
The United States has about 2,000 troops on the ground in Syria.
Bozdag reiterated Ankara's demand that Washington cease its ""inexplicable"" and ""unacceptable"" support of the YPG.
""In the case that Turkey's demands are not met, we will take determined steps in Afrin and other regions to protect our interests. We will take these steps without considering what anyone can say,"" Bozdag said. ""When will this happen? Suddenly.""

The Cabinet also agreed to extend a state of emergency imposed after a failed 2016 coup attempt from Jan. 18, Bozdag said, in a move likely to prolong a post-putsch crackdown that saw more than 50,000 people arrested and 150,000 others sacked or suspended from their jobs.

Casino thefts in the former Portuguese colony of Macau, which rakes in gambling revenue more than five times that of the Las Vegas strip, are rare, with the majority of cases typically involving employees. 
Wynn confirmed to Reuters in an email that the matter was being handled by the police.
Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau, known as the DICJ, said it was concerned about the incident and had asked casino operators to beef up their security.
The theft, which took place this week, was carried out by a man from Macau who worked in a high-roller VIP room at Wynn's resort on Macau's teeming peninsula, media reported.
Public broadcaster TDM said police were also investigating if there were multiple suspects but did not give further detail.
Typically, Wynn casino chips can only be exchanged for cash in Wynn's casino, so anyone with stolen chips would likely try to cash in small amounts at a time rather than all at once, to avoid attracting attention.
The last major casino heists happened in 2015 and 2016 when employees working in Macau's VIP parlors stole millions of dollars from junket rooms in the casinos.
Macau's booming revenues, which totaled $33 billion last year, are underpinned by its VIP junket system, where licensed middlemen act on behalf of casinos to attract ""big whale"" spenders by arranging their travel and accommodation and handling their gambling credit.
Macau's six concessionaires Sands China, Wynn, MGM China, SJM Holdings, Melco Resorts and Galaxy Entertainment all rely heavily on the junket industry for more than half of their gambling revenues.

Earlier satellite imaging showed two large slicks, with the larger one also thicker and more concentrated, but the latest data had found four slicks ranging in size from 48 square kms (19 square miles) to 5.5 square kms (2.1 square miles), the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) said.
The large tanker Sanchi (IMO:9356608) sank in the worst oil ship disaster in decades on Sunday, raising worries about damage to the marine ecosystem. The bodies of two sailors were recovered from the ship while a third body was pulled from the sea near the vessel. The remaining 29 crew of the ship are presumed dead.
The Chinese Ministry of Transport said on Wednesday a salvage team had located the wreck, which was at a depth of 115 meters (377 feet) under sea level, and was preparing to send underwater robots to explore it.
The SOA said in its statement late on Wednesday it had collected water samples from 19 spill sites, and found water from five sites had petroleum substances at levels exceeding standards.
Clean-up teams were continuing to monitor the wreck area to assess the drift and diffusion of the oil spill and the ecological impact.
One of the slicks, about 18 kms in length and 300 meters wide, was found about 11 kms north of the sunken tanker, and another, about 20 kms long and about 500 meters wide, was found 2 kms southwest of the wreck, it said.
The Sanchi had been adrift and ablaze after crashing into the freighter CF Crystal (IMO:9497050) on Jan. 6. Strong winds pushed it away from the Chinese coast, where the incident happened, and into Japan's exclusive economic zone.
The ship was carrying 136,000 tonnes or almost 1 million barrels of condensate - an ultra-light, highly flammable crude oil.

Thousands of members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels handed in their weapons under a peace deal signed with the government in 2016 to end more than 52 years of war. The group is now campaigning in legislative and presidential elections scheduled for this year. 
""Wilmar Asprilla and Angel de Jesus Montoya were in the municipality conducting a community meeting and preparing a meeting to support the candidate for the house of representatives of Antioquia,"" the FARC said in a statement.
Community members heard gunshots from a parking lot at around 11 p.m. local time on Tuesday (0400 GMT Wednesday) and when police arrived they found the two men dead, the statement added.
A spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry said the government was looking into the situation but had no further comment at this time.
The men are just two of 30 ex-fighters who have been killed by people hoping to destabilize the peace process, the group said. Six former fighters were killed in restive Narino province in October.
The United Nations verification mission in the country, which received thousands of weapons from the FARC when they demobilized, said in a statement on Wednesday that the free exercise of political rights must be guaranteed during campaigning.
Former rebels have repeatedly raised concerns that they may be assassinated by right-wing paramilitary gangs or drug traffickers, in a replay of about 5,000 targeted killings during the 1980s, when the group first attempted to found the Patriotic Union political party.

Israeli officials declined initially to comment on the incident which was under a military gag order. Jenin residents said shooting could still be heard in the early hours of Thursday morning.
A Palestinian health ministry official identified the man killed as Ahmed Jarrar, a Hamas militant and the son of a senior Hamas commander, Naser Jarrar, who was killed by Israeli forces in 2002. 
Israeli troops have mounted a search for the killers of Rabbi Raziel Shevah, a resident of a settlement outpost near the Palestinian town of Nablus, who was shot in his car in a drive-by attack on Jan. 9.
Tensions in the region have risen since U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on Dec. 6 in which he recognized disputed Jerusalem as Israel's capital and at least 18 Palestinians and one Israeli have been killed since then.
Trump's reversal of decades of U.S. policy enraged Palestinians, who seek to create an independent state including Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Israel captured those territories in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally. It says the entire city is its eternal, indivisible capital.
Trump's announcement sparked protests and violent clashes in the West Bank and along the Israel-Gaza border.
U.S.-led peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014. A bid by Trump's administration to restart them has shown no real signs of progress. Vice President Mike Pence is due to visit the region from Jan. 20 to 23.

1264,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 06:41PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump accuses Russia of helping North Korea evade sanctions; says U.S. needs more missile defense,"By Steve Holland, Roberta Rampton and Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump complained on Wednesday that Russia was helping North Korea to evade international sanctions, signaling frustration with a country he had hoped to forge friendly relations with after his 2016 election win.
""Russia is not helping us at all with North Korea,"" Trump said during an Oval Office interview with Reuters. ""What China is helping us with, Russia is denting. In other words, Russia is making up for some of what China is doing.""
China and Russia both signed onto the latest rounds of United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea imposed last year. There was no immediate comment from the Russian embassy in Washington on Trump's remarks.
During a 53-minute interview with a fresh Diet Coke near at hand on his desk, Trump also said he was considering a big ""fine"" as part of an investigation into China's alleged theft of intellectual property; that he has lost all trust in the chief Democratic Party negotiator on immigration in the Senate; and declined to clear up conflicting reports about his use of the phrase ""shithole countries"" in a White House meeting, which caused an international outcry.
With North Korea persisting as the major global challenge facing Trump this year, the president cast doubt on whether talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would be useful. In the past he has not ruled out direct talks with Kim.
""I'd sit down, but I'm not sure that sitting down will solve the problem,"" he said, noting that past negotiations with the North Koreans by his predecessors had failed to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
He blamed his three immediate predecessors, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, for failing to resolve the crisis and, a day after his doctor gave him a perfect score on a cognitive test, suggested he had the mental acuity to solve it.
""I guess they all realized they're going to have to leave it to a president that scored the highest on tests,"" he joked.
He declined to comment when asked whether he had engaged in any communications at all with Kim, with whom he has exchanged public insults and threats, heightening tensions in the region.
Trump said he hoped the standoff with Pyongyang could be resolved ""in a peaceful way, but it’s very possible that it can’t.""
Asked whether he thought the United States needs more missile defense systems, he said, ""Yes, yes I do. We're ordering more missile defense and we're ordering more missile offense also.""
Trump praised China for its efforts to restrict oil and coal supplies to North Korea but said Beijing could do much more to help constrain Pyongyang.
The White House last week welcomed news that imports to China from North Korea, which counts on Beijing as its main economic partner, plunged in December to their lowest in dollar terms since at least the start of 2014. 
'CLOSER EVERY DAY'
Trump said Russia appears to be filling in the gaps left by the Chinese. 
Western European security sources told Reuters in December that Russian tankers had supplied fuel to North Korea on at least three occasions in recent months by transferring cargoes at sea in violation of international sanctions. Russia has denied breaching North Korea sanctions.
North Korea relies on imported fuel to keep its struggling economy functioning. It also requires oil for its intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear program.
Trump has repeatedly blamed a U.S. investigation into whether Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election for hindering an improvement in U.S.-Russian relations.
""He can do a lot,"" Trump said of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""But unfortunately we don't have much of a relationship with Russia, and in some cases it's probable that what China takes back, Russia gives. So the net result is not as good as it could be.""
Andrew Weiss, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Moscow does not share the depth of U.S. concerns over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. “It’s simply not the case, if Trump’s hands were not tied on Russia, that he and Putin could magically work together to solve the Korea crisis.”
Trump said Pyongyang is steadily advancing in its ability to deliver a missile to the United States.
""They're not there yet, but they're close. And they get closer every day,"" he said.
    North Korea said after its last intercontinental ballistic missile launch in November that the test had put the U.S. mainland within range. Some experts agreed that based on the missile’s trajectory and distance it had the capability to fly as far as Washington D.C.
They said, however, that North Korea had not yet offered any proof that it had mastered all technical hurdles, including development of a re-entry vehicle needed to deliver a heavy nuclear warhead reliably atop an ICBM.
Trump said he welcomed talks between North and South Korea over the Winter Olympics to be held in the South next month and said this could be an initial phase in helping defuse the crisis.
He would not say whether the United States has been considering a limited, pre-emptive attack to show the North that the United States means business.
""We're playing a very, very hard game of poker and you don't want to reveal your hand,"" he said.
'TOUGH-TALKING'
Trump also gave the clearest indication yet that his administration will take retaliatory trade action against China.
Trump and his economic adviser Gary Cohn, who was also in the Oval Office, said China had forced U.S. companies to transfer their intellectual property to China as a cost of doing business there.
The United States has started a trade investigation into the issue, and Cohn said the United States Trade Representative would be making recommendations about it soon.
""We have a very big intellectual property potential fine going, which is going to come out soon,"" Trump said. 
Trump said the damages could be high, without elaborating on how the numbers were reached or how the costs would be imposed. 
WASHINGTON IS ""A MEAN PLACE""
Trump was also asked about a private gathering with a bipartisan group of senators last week at which he was reported to have used a vulgar term to describe Haiti and African nations. He would not confirm whether he had said ""shithole countries,"" but described it as a ""tough-talking"" meeting.
He said he had ""lost all trust"" in Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, one of the participants who later talked publicly about Trump's comments during the meeting.
Trump criticized a proposed bipartisan deal on protecting children of illegal immigrants from deportation, calling it ""horrible."" A deal was still possible by a March 5 deadline but that ""time is running out,"" he added.
Speaking a day after his doctor recommended diet and exercise to lose 10-15 pounds (4.5 to 6.8 kg), Trump said he would prefer dieting by eating smaller portions than exercise.
""I get exercise. I mean I walk, I this, I that,"" Trump said. ""I run over to a building next door. I get more exercise than people think.""

As for the central lesson he has taken away from a year in the White House, Trump said: ""I love Washington, but it's a mean place, it's a very deceptive place.""

ATLANTA (Reuters) - A winter storm that caused at least four deaths in the U.S. South brought record low temperatures on Wednesday to parts of the region, where it coated roads with ice, snapped power lines and prompted schools to close. 
Frigid temperatures and snow were also forecast for the mid-Atlantic region and much of New England through Thursday. The National Weather Service issued winter weather advisories and storm warnings for northern Georgia into Virginia and from Massachusetts to Maine.
In Austin, Texas, a vehicle plunged more than 30 feet (9 meters) off a frozen overpass late on Tuesday, killing a man in his 40s, Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Service said on its Twitter feed. An 82-year-old woman who suffered from dementia was found dead on Wednesday behind her Houston-area home, likely the victim of exposure to the cold, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said. 
In Georgia, two people were fatally struck by a car that slid on an ice patch near Macon, local media said.
At Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the nation's busiest with a typical volume of 2,700 arrivals and departures a day, about 470 flights were canceled as of Wednesday afternoon, according to tracking service Flightaware.com. 
The sheriff's office in Oconee County, Georgia, east of Atlanta, tried humor to keep people off icy roads.
""I know you need cigarettes, beer and wine to get you through having your kids at home. Can you just do without for a day? Stay home,"" the office said on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
Wednesday's storm is not the first this winter to bring a blast of frosty weather to the South, where parts of Florida and the Louisiana coast saw their first measurable snowfall in decades.
The governors of Georgia, North Carolina and Louisiana declared states of emergency because of severe winter weather conditions, which caused multiple car accidents during rush hour.
Since Monday, more than 9 inches (23 cm) of snow has fallen in Durham, North Carolina, the National Weather Service said. 
North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned at a news briefing that cold temperatures Wednesday night would make travel conditions even more hazardous.
""The snow is pretty but don't be fooled,"" Cooper said.
In Atlanta, many people appeared to be heeding Georgia Governor Nathan Deal’s plea to stay off the roads as only a few cars crept along on typically packed highways.
A few people bundled to go out in temperatures that were well below freezing in a city known for its sweltering summer heat.
“We don’t dare try to get the car out of the garage,” said teacher Kimberly Hodges, 40, who was walking her puppy in the city’s East Atlanta Village neighborhood. “It’s a mess out here.” 
The weather in Atlanta is not expected to get above freezing until Thursday afternoon. State government offices and many schools were expected to remain closed until at least then.
In Houston, the nation's fourth most populous city, most freeways were closed on Wednesday morning after icing over, the city's Office of Emergency Management said.

In storm-hit North and South Carolina, more than 32,000 homes and businesses were without power as of Wednesday afternoon, utilities data showed.

1266,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>","With eye on Brexit talks, May to deepen security ties with France","By Elizabeth Piper and Michel Rose
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Britain and France will agree on Thursday to deepen security cooperation, a move which Prime Minister Theresa May hopes will win her goodwill in talks on leaving the European Union.
May, who was weakened by losing her Conservative Party's parliamentary majority in an election last year, wants to use a summit with President Emmanuel Macron to show Britain still has plenty to offer EU member states as she negotiates Brexit.
But in talks at Sandhurst, Britain's army officer training academy, she will be under pressure from Macron to accept more asylum seekers and to pay more for border security on the French side of the Channel.
She may also have to respond to overtures from the EU this week for Britain to change its mind and stay in the bloc, although a government spokesman ruled this out.
""Today's summit will underline that we remain committed to defending our people and upholding our values as liberal democracies in the face of any threat, whether at home or abroad,"" May said in a statement.
""And while this summit takes place as the UK prepares to leave the EU, this does not mean that the UK is leaving Europe ... A strong relationship between our two countries is in the UK, France and Europe's interests, both now and into the future.""
Neither leader wants the talks to focus on Brexit, with French officials saying the negotiations are led by Brussels, not Paris, and British aides underlining that the summit is about ""shared interests and priorities"".
Few meetings with May escape discussion of the talks on unraveling more than 40 years of union. But the two leaders will try to focus on new initiatives to enhance security and defense cooperation, including Thursday's first meeting of the five heads of British and French intelligence agencies.
""Recent terrorist attacks across Europe underline the scale of the cross-border challenge we face in keeping our citizens safe,"" a spokesman said.
""We will work together to deepen and enhance cooperation on law enforcement, security and criminal justice, to improve the safety of citizens across Europe and to strengthen our internal security capabilities."" 
BORDER AND BAYEUX
The two are also expected to commit to joint military operations including a combined expeditionary force.
Britain will pledge to send three Chinook helicopters to Mali to provide logistical support for a French counter-terrorism operation and to participate in a new European defense initiative, the European Intervention Initiative.
France, in turn, has committed to contribute troops to British-led NATO forces in Estonia in 2019.
But a potentially more pressing issue will be the border between the two countries, which under the Le Touquet agreement gives Britain a border in France - blamed by some officials for attracting migrants to Calais.
French officials said on Wednesday that the two sides would sign a new immigration treaty to complement the deal and have called on Britain to provide more money and resources to tackle migrant flows.
A spokesman for May said discussions were continuing but agreed the agreement was ""very beneficial to the UK and we value its continuation"". He added: ""If there were requests for further help in relation to security we would look at those.""
Overall, aides on both sides hope the summit will show the strength of ties between the two countries, something one French official said had become more important after the election of U.S. President Donald Trump.

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 04:58PM ET</span>","U.S. signals open-ended presence in Syria, seeks patience on Assad's removal","By David Brunnstrom
PALO ALTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday signaled an open-ended military presence in Syria as part of a broader strategy to prevent Islamic State's resurgence, pave the way diplomatically for the eventual departure of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and curtail Iran's influence.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, in a speech at Stanford University, called for ""patience"" on Assad's departure - the clearest indication yet of an acknowledgment that Russia and Iran have bolstered Assad and that he is unlikely to leave power immediately.
Billed as the Trump administration's new strategy on Syria, the announcement will prolong the risks and redefine the mission for the U.S. military, which has for years sought to define its operations in Syria along more narrow lines of battling Islamic State and has about 2,000 U.S. ground forces in the country.
While much of the U.S. strategy would focus on diplomatic efforts, Tillerson said: 
""But let us be clear: the United States will maintain a military presence in Syria, focused on ensuring ISIS cannot re-emerge,"" while acknowledging many Americans' skepticism of military involvement in conflicts abroad, Tillerson said.
U.S. forces in Syria have already faced direct threats from Syrian and Iranian-backed forces, leading to the shoot-down of Iranian drones and a Syrian jet last year, as well as to tensions with Russia.
Trump administration officials, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, had previously disclosed elements of the policy but Tillerson's speech was meant to formalize and clearly define it.
A U.S. disengagement from Syria would provide Iran with an opportunity to reinforce its position in Syria, Tillerson said.
As candidate, U.S. President Donald Trump was critical of his predecessors' military interventions in the Middle East and Afghanistan. As president, however, Trump has had to commit to an open-ended presence in Afghanistan and, now, Syria.
The transition to what appears to be open-ended stability operations in Syria could leave those U.S.-backed forces vulnerable to shifting alliances, power struggles and miscommunications as Assad's allies and enemies vie for greater control of post-war Syria.
After nearly seven years of war, hundreds of thousands of Syrians killed and a humanitarian disaster, Tillerson asked nations to keep up economic pressure on Assad but provide aid to areas no longer under Islamic State's control.
Tillerson said free, transparent elections in which the Syrian diaspora participate ""will result in the permanent departure of Assad and his family from power. This process will take time, and we urge patience in the departure of Assad and the establishment of new leadership,"" Tillerson said.
""Responsible change may not come as immediately as some hope for, but rather through an incremental process of constitutional reform and U.N.-supervised elections. But that change will come,"" he said.
Syrian opposition member Hadi al-Bahra welcomed Tillerson’s announcement but urged more details.
“This is the first time Washington has said clearly it has U.S. interests in Syria that it is ready to defend,” Bahra told Reuters.
However, he said, more clarity was needed on how Washington will force the implementation of the political process and how it “will force the Assad regime into accepting a political settlement that leads to establishing a safe and neutral environment that leads to a transition through free and fair elections.""
""SWISS CHEESE""
The top U.S. diplomat said Washington would carry out ""stabilization initiatives"" such as clearing landmines and restoring basic utilities in areas no longer under Islamic State control, while making clear that ""'stabilization' is not a synonym for open-ended nation-building or a synonym for reconstruction. But it is essential.""
Tillerson said the United States would ""vigorously support"" a United Nations process to end the conflict, a so-far stalled process, and called on Russia, a main supporter of Assad, to ""put new levels of pressure"" on the Syrian government to ""credibly engage"" with U.N. peace efforts.
The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria said on Wednesday he had invited the Syrian government and opposition to a special meeting next week in Vienna.
But it was not immediately clear how or why Moscow would heed Washington's oft-repeated demands.
James Jeffrey, a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey and Iraq who served as a deputy national security adviser to President George W. Bush, said that while Tillerson set down the broad parameters of a first comprehensive U.S. strategy for Syria, he left major questions unanswered.
“It’s full of holes like Swiss cheese, but before we just had the holes,” said Jeffrey, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Key questions that Tillerson left unaddressed, he continued, included how long Assad should remain in power and whether he would play a role in any political transition.
Tillerson praised Turkey's role in taking on Islamic State. Ties between the two countries have been strained over U.S. support for the Syrian Democratic forces, the mainly Kurdish-led militias fighting Islamic State in northern Syria with the help of U.S. forces.
The U.S.-led coalition said on Sunday it was working with the SDF to set up a 30,000-strong force that would operate along the borders with Turkey and Iraq, as well as within Syria.

Assad responded by vowing to crush the new force and drive U.S. troops from Syria. Russia called the plans a plot to dismember Syria and place part of it under U.S. control, and Turkey described the force as a ""terror army.""

Dressed in ponchos, the shamans passed rue leaves - believed to ward off evil and bring good luck - over photos of the Argentine pontiff, and stood by the ocean playing percussion instruments.
The pope lands in Peru on Thursday after finishing a trip to neighboring Chile. He will visit the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) jungle city of Puerto Maldonado and the northern city of Trujillo as well as the capital, Lima.
""I see it going very well, above all in Trujillo and Puerto Maldonado. There will be good news and we ask the pope to pray with all the Andean priests,"" said shaman Juan Osco, as he tossed flower petals over the pope's image.
""We want to congratulate Francis for being a leader with enough strength to get rid of pedophile priests,"" he said.
In Chile, Francis has faced protests from Catholics upset with his 2015 appointment of Bishop Juan Barros to head the diocese of Osorno. Barros denies accusations that he protected a priest found guilty in a Vatican investigation of abusing teenage boys.
The pope, who also faces criticism in Peru for his handling of abuse allegations against the former leaders of an elite Catholic society, met with victims of child sexual abuse in Chile and expressed ""pain and shame."" 
Seen as kinder toward indigenous people than previous Church leaders, Francis will meet with Amazonian indigenous leaders on Friday. He shared a meal with Mapuche in Chile on Wednesday.

Shamans from different indigenous groups in Peru frequently give their visions for events, politicians and soccer games.

Twenty nations hosted by the United States and Canada in Vancouver agreed on Tuesday to consider tougher sanctions to press North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has refused to give up development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States in spite of increasingly severe U.N. sanctions, raising fears of a new war on the Korean peninsula.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said top diplomats from Moscow and Beijing had not been invited to the meeting, which was made up of countries that backed South Korea during the 1950-53 Korea War, and that the events were damaging the authority of the United Nations.
""It is an absolutely unacceptable situation, when 17 countries take upon themselves the role of 'helper' to the UN Security Council and interpreter of its resolutions, thereby actually putting its authority into doubt,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
""Such events, conducted hastily and to the detriment of functioning multilateral formats, are not contributing to the normalisation of the situation around the Korean peninsula, but on the contrary, aggravating it.""
In Washington, a senior U.S. official said that the meeting had been planned for months and sought to push back against the idea that it would aggravate tensions on the peninsula.
""It is not factually accurate to say that the event was conducted hastily. This has been many months in the planning,"" said Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein, responding to the Russian foreign ministry's statement.
""We believe that this is another step forward in ensuring that the sanctions hold tight,"" he added, saying Washington would brief Beijing and Moscow. ""We all share the same view that it is time for North Korea to come to the table and let's negotiate a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.""

North and South Korea began talks last week for the first time in more than two years and agreed on Wednesday to field a combined women's ice hockey team and march together under one flag at next month's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

Kidnappings are rife in Nigeria, where domestic security is weak, though they overwhelmingly target other Nigerians. However, abductions of foreigners are not uncommon.
The foreigners were ambushed by unknown gunmen on their way from the town of Kafanchan in Kaduna state to the capital Abuja, Mukhtar Aliyu, a spokesman for the Kaduna state police, said by telephone.
Kafanchan is about 3-1/2 hours' drive northeast of Abuja.
""The two police escorts attached to them engaged the kidnappers in a fierce gun battle, which resulted in the unfortunate death of the two police officers,"" Aliyu said.
The United States embassy in Nigeria declined to comment. 
Global Affairs Canada is aware of the reports of the kidnapping of two Canadian citizens and consular officials in Nigeria are in contact with local authorities to gather additional information, spokesman John Babcock said.

LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers voted in favor of the government's legislative blueprint for Brexit on Wednesday, marking a victory for Prime Minister Theresa May over political opponents who want a softer approach to leaving the European Union.
But the legislation will now face scrutiny from parliament's largely pro-EU upper house, where May's party does not have a majority, which will intensify efforts to force a re-run of a 2016 referendum, and water down or even stop the divorce.
The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill was approved by a 324 to 295 vote in the lower house - a milestone on the long road toward cementing the legal foundations of Britain's departure from the bloc.
The bill repeals the 1972 law that made Britain a member of the EU, and transfers EU laws into British ones.
""This bill is essential for preparing the country for the historic milestone of withdrawing from the European Union,"" Brexit minister David Davis told parliament before the vote. 
""It ensures that on day one we will have a statute book that works, delivering the smooth and orderly exit desired by people and businesses across the United Kingdom and being delivered by this government.""
The bill has become the focal point for months of divisive debate about what type of EU divorce Britain should seek, severely testing May's ability to deliver on her exit strategy without a parliamentary majority.
But despite one embarrassing parliamentary defeat, several government concessions and rebellion from within her own party, May's Conservative lawmakers overcame opposition from the Labour Party and others.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn instructed his lawmakers to vote against passage of the bill because the government had not met conditions set out by the party, demanding safeguards on a range of issues including workers and consumer rights.
""This bill has never been fit for purpose,"" said Labour's Brexit policy chief, Keir Starmer, describing any attempt to persuade the government that the legislation needed to change as ""talking to a brick wall"".
LORDS SCRUTINY
The upper house, the House of Lords, will now begin months of scrutiny of the bill before it can become law. Any changes made by the lords will require approval from the lower house, and the whole process could take until May to complete.
The House of Lords contains a diverse, largely unelected, mix of political appointees, experts, and members who inherited their positions. Many lords are opposed to Brexit. 
Some of those figures are expected to try to soften the Brexit approach to include remaining in the EU's single market or a second public vote, but the most likely areas for changes involve technical and constitutional issues.
May has ruled out a second vote and says Britain will be leaving. Labour's Corbyn is also committed to following through with Brexit, albeit pushing for different priorities and aims.
Nevertheless, calls for a second referendum are expected to persist, particularly as both pro- and anti-EU politicians have mooted the possibility recently. 
EU officials and some member states have said they would welcome a change of heart from Britain.

But, barring a major change of policy from one of the country's two largest political parties, Britain remains on course to leave the bloc in March 2019.

1274,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",U.N. chief says don't harm Iran nuclear deal over unrelated issues,"By Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Wednesday that any issues not directly related to the Iran nuclear deal ""should be addressed without prejudice to preserving the agreement,"" his spokesman said amid U.S. concerns with Tehran.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that European allies and Congress have to work with him to fix ""the disastrous flaws"" in the nuclear pact or face a U.S. exit. Trump wants it strengthened with a separate agreement within 120 days.
Trump also views Iran as a rising threat in the Middle East and the United States has accused Tehran of violating U.N. resolutions by supplying weapons to Houthi rebels in Yemen. Iran has denied supplying the Houthis.
Most U.N. and Western sanctions on Iran were lifted under the nuclear deal. However, Iran is still subject to a U.N. arms embargo and other restrictions, which are not technically part of the nuclear deal.
""The (nuclear deal) constitutes a major achievement of nuclear non-proliferation and diplomacy, and has contributed to regional and international peace and security,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on the second anniversary of the implementation of the deal between Iran and key world powers.
Guterres called for concerns relating to the implementation of the nuclear deal ""to be addressed through the mechanisms established by the agreement,"" Dujarric said. 
The parties to the nuclear deal created a joint commission to handle any complaints of breaches. If the complaining state is not satisfied with how the commission addresses its concerns, it can then take its grievance to the U.N. Security Council.
If the Security Council receives a complaint of a breach it would then need to vote within 30 days on a resolution to extend sanctions relief. If it fails to vote, the sanctions would be automatically re-imposed.
Iran says its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes and that it will stick to the accord as long as the other signatories respect it, but will ""shred"" the deal if Washington pulls out.
The U.S. administrations of both Trump and his predecessor Barack Obama, together with European allies, have also raised concerns over ballistic missile tests carried out by Iran. 
Under a U.N. resolution enshrining the nuclear deal, Iran is also ""called upon"" to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years. Some states argue that language does not make it obligatory.
Iran has denied that it has missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads.

Senior U.S. administration officials said last week that Trump will work with European partners on a follow-on agreement that enshrines certain triggers that Iran cannot exceed related to ballistic missiles.

He said common interests on fighting terrorism meant this was a good time to resume talks, but both sides remained at odds over issues such as the continued detention of Yucel.
German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr added that German-Turkish relations still faced ""significant challenges,"" but Berlin was ready to continue working to ""improve relations bit by bit"".
German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu earlier this month pledged to improve a relationship that soured amid disputes over Ankara's crackdown following the failed 2016 coup and the arrests of German citizens in Turkey.
Germany, home to some 3 million people with a Turkish background, remains critical of Turkey's post-coup arrests of some 50,000 people, and the suspension or firing of 150,000 others, including teachers, judges and soldiers.
Turkey says the crackdown on alleged supporters of a network of followers of a Muslim cleric it blames for the coup is needed to shore up security, and has criticized Germany's refusal to hand over asylum seekers it says were involved in the putsch.
Differences remain over the fate of Yucel, a reporter for German newspaper Die Welt, whom Ankara accuses of spreading propaganda for the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). He denies the charge.
Gabriel has vowed to block major arms sales to Turkey until Yucel's case is resolved. But the foreign minister signaled after his meeting with Cavusoglu that Berlin would consider whether to deliver mine protection gear for armored vehicles in Turkey, an issue not linked to arrests.
Some members of Gabriel's own Social Democrats and the radical Left party have rejected any such move.
Sevim Dagdalen, a Left party lawmaker, said Germany should immediately halt all weapons exports to Turkey, voicing concerns about recent Turkish warnings about imminent military operations against Kurdish forces in northern Syria.
""Plans by Foreign Minister Gabriel to conclude new weapons deals with Turkey are a slap in the face to the resistance against Islamic State,"" she said in a statement.
Stern magazine reported on Wednesday that Gabriel had met last fall with officials from Rheinmetall about potential Turkish exports.

Rheinmetall has a joint venture with the Turkish firm BMC, and hopes to set up a factory that would build tanks, trucks and buses in the city of Karasu, east of Istanbul, it said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican presidential hopeful and former first lady Margarita Zavala pledged to curb violence and crime by pulling soldiers off the streets in a reversal of her husband's military-led drug strategy that ushered in a sharp increase in violence.
If elected this July, Zavala said she would double and strengthen the police force while withdrawing the thousands of troops that her husband, former president Felipe Calderon, began deploying at the end of 2006.
""I want ... to fortify the police in a national police system ... that allows me to gradually put the police in charge of security and let the armed forces do what they had always been doing,"" she said in an interview with Reuters.
Violence is shaping up to be a key campaign theme after murders last year surged to a record high. Well over 100,000 people have been killed in gang violence in the past decade. 
As officials grapple to control the bloodshed, President Enrique Pena Nieto last month signed into law a contentious security bill that would formally enshrine the parameters for using the military in crime-fighting.
A host of human rights groups and international organizations attacked the bill, citing reported cases of abuses by Mexico's military. 
Zavala, 50, said her plan would boost police salaries, offer merit-based promotions and certify officers under a single set of national criteria. 
""We have to give the institution dignity,"" she said. 
Zavala did not offer a potential timeline for the changes. 
The former attorney also said Mexico now faces different issues to the ones confronted by her husband's center-right administration, and criticized the current government for ""abandoning"" the police.
""There is a much more serious problem of kidnapping, extortion and arms and human trafficking,"" she said. ""If the police had kept being strengthened, today we wouldn't be talking about the problem of the security law."" 
Leftist presidential front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said he would integrate the police, army and marines and revive the public security ministry that the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) scrapped in 2012. 
Running as an independent after leaving the center-right National Action Party (PAN) in October, Zavala must collect 866,593 signatures by mid-February to land an official spot on the ballot. 

Zavala's spokesman said Mexico's national electoral institute (INE) has validated nearly 724,000 signatures thus far, although the campaign has collected more than a million in total.

STRASBOURG (Reuters) - Leading British anti-EU campaigner Nigel Farage rowed back on Wednesday from remarks favoring a second referendum on Brexit, a week after he unleashed a new round of debate and a chorus of invitations from European politicians for Britain to reconsider.
In a boisterous exchange with Irish premier Leo Varadkar, Farage, who leads the UK Independence Party in the European Parliament, said there was an establishment plot to thwart the will of British voters and keep Britain in the EU.
""You are part of course of a big attempt here and elsewhere to frustrate and to attempt to overturn Brexit,"" Farage said.
""I don't want a second referendum on Brexit. Absolutely not. But I fear that you are all working together with Tony Blair and Nick Clegg to make sure we get the worst possible deal,"" he said, referring to a former prime minister a former deputy prime minister who have campaigned for a new vote to keep Britain in.
A second referendum on Brexit has been ruled out by Prime Minister Theresa May and is also not backed by opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. Britain served its two year notice last March, putting it on course to exit the EU in 2019.
Farage's flirtation with a new vote -- he told a talk show host last week he was warming to the idea as a way to ""kill"" support for staying in the EU ""off for a generation"" -- captured imaginations in Europe, where politicians are resigned to Britain leaving but reluctant to close the path for it to stay.
On Tuesday, European Council President Donald Tusk weighed in on the debate, telling Britons that ""our hearts are still open to you"" if they change their minds.
On Wednesday, the EU's chief executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, said that the Union would still be ready to welcome Britain back into the bloc even after it leaves.
""We are not throwing out the British, we want them to stay. And if they want to, they should be able to,"" he said. ""Once the British have left under Article 50 there is still Article 49 which allows a return to membership and I would like that."" 
In parliament, Varadkar noted that Ireland held a second referendum in 2009 that reversed a 2008 vote to reject an EU treaty. It voted in favor of an amendment overturning a constitutional ban on divorce in 1995, nine years after voters had rejected it.
""I don't think it's anti-democratic for anyone to change their mind or have a second vote,"" he said.
He won applause for a speech in English, French, German and Gaelic that underlined Ireland's EU loyalty. He rejected Farage's accusation that he was taking a hard line on denying Britain full access to EU markets to damage British interests at the expense of the Irish themselves.
An adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron, who will meet May on Thursday, said that if Britons held a second referendum, France would ""look kindly"" on any request to stay.
Seb Dance, a Labour member of the European Parliament from London and staunch Brexit opponent, told the chamber: ""There are people up and down the breadth of the United Kingdom who are fighting Brexit.

""So don't count us out yet. As Farage has said, this issue is not settled.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea rejects as a ""provocation"" a U.S.-led meeting in Vancouver that discussed tougher sanctions that Pyongyang will fight, a senior North Korean diplomat told Reuters on Wednesday.
Twenty nations agreed on Tuesday to consider tougher sanctions to press North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned Pyongyang that it could trigger a military response if it did not choose negotiations.
Choe Myong Nam, North Korea's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, said the Vancouver meeting was ""harmful and dangerous."" 
""We denounce that meeting in the strongest possible terms, that is really harmful. It will not be conducive to peace and security and to the ongoing process between North and South that is aimed at creating a peaceful environment, easing tensions and promoting reconciliation between the North and the South,"" Choe said in an interview.
""We are truly committed and determined to do what we can to fight against sanctions,"" he said.
Asked about the possibility of a U.S. strike against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Choe said: ""We have all the capacity to deter such maneuvers on the part of the hostile forces. We are ready for dialogue and confrontation. We are ready for both.""
But he said that North Korea is also determined to make the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea a success. 
""EVENT OF KOREAN NATION""
""We regard this as an event of the Korean nation, not just of South Korea, (something) which should be jointly and brilliantly demonstrated to the world,"" he said.
A delegation of North Korean Olympic officials will arrive soon in Switzerland for talks scheduled at the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne on Saturday, Choe added.
North Korea has proposed that the United Nations human rights office (OHCHR) send a mission to South Korea to interview North Korean restaurant workers ""abducted"" in April 2016, as well as their families in North Korea, Choe said. 
""Our proposal is to make sure OHCHR undertakes a mission to both sides and finally do what they can do to secure the repatriation of these women.""
A U.N. human rights spokeswoman was unable to confirm receipt of North Korea's Sept. 28 letter about the proposed visits, addressed to U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
Choe, asked if the North Korean restaurant workers were an obstacle to family reunions of Koreans separated by the divided peninsula, said that for family reunions to go ahead, the restaurant workers would need to be repatriated.
""We wouldn't say it is a condition. It is a principled matter. South Korea has no right or qualification to talk about reunions of separated families,"" he said.
""We urge South Korea to repatriate the abducted DPRK women citizens immediately without any preconditions, if they are truly interested in improving inter-Korean relations and truly interested in moving things forward in the right direction.""

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A delegation approved by the Taliban's supreme leader visited the Pakistani capital this week for exploratory talks on restarting peace negotiations to end Afghanistan's 16-year war, two senior officials in the movement said.
It was unclear if any progress was made in the unofficial meetings with a representative of a prominent Afghan politician. Many previous attempts have failed to revive direct talks that ended nearly as soon as they started in 2015.
The Islamabad talks on Monday followed another back-channel meeting over the weekend in Turkey between individuals with Taliban connections and representatives of Hizb-i-Islami, the party of a former Taliban-allied commander who last year laid down arms to join Afghan politics. 
A spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said on Wednesday he was not aware of the Islamabad talks, while the Taliban did not respond to queries. Both sides on Monday denied participating in the Turkey talks. 
However, two senior Taliban officials said on condition of anonymity that supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada had approved Monday's exploratory meeting in Islamabad on restarting talks to end the war that kills thousands of Afghans each year.
Akhundzada is widely believed to be in hiding in Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the Turkey meeting had no legitimate Taliban representatives in attendance.
""This is an intelligence game that aims at defaming and damaging the real peace process in Afghanistan,"" he said in a statement that referred to the Taliban position that true negotiations can only happen once all foreign troops leave.
SAFE HAVENS
Washington has piled pressure on to Pakistan to persuade the insurgents' leaders to negotiate as well as crack down on alleged Taliban safe havens inside the country - tactics that Pakistan has said are incompatible.
The three-member Taliban delegation from Qatar included Shababuddin Dilawar and Jan Mohammad Madani from the Taliban's political office in Qatari capital as well as the brother-in-law of Mullah Jacoob, son of the late Taliban founder Mullah Mohammad Omar, the sources said.
They met representatives of Afghan politician Pir Syed Hamid Gilani, head of the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan and the son former High Peace Council chief who died last July, a senior aide to Gilani confirmed on condition of anonymity. Gilani's office did not respond to queries.
The Taliban's Haqqani network last week released 14 Afghan army soldiers in the eastern province of Paktia as a goodwill gesture ahead of the talks, according to both the Taliban officials and the aide to Gilani. 
In his latest report to the United Nations Security Council last month, the U.N. secretary general said there had been ""no meaningful progress towards a peace settlement"".
Under a new strategy announced last year, the United States has stepped up air strikes and boosted assistance to Afghan government forces fighting the Taliban to try to break a stalemate and force the insurgents to the negotiating table.
Though the Afghan government still controls less than two-thirds of the country, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Wednesday touted the new strategy as a success and specifically mentioned possible future direct talks with the Taliban.
""The U.S. policy on Afghanistan is working,"" Haley told reporters in New York on Wednesday after travelling to Kabul at the weekend with the U.N. Security Council. ""We are seeing that we're closer to talks with the Taliban and the peace process than we've seen before.""
She said Afghan officials had told the envoys that since the U.S. strategy was put in place ""they're starting to see the Taliban concede, they are starting to see them move towards coming to the table"".

Haley said that the entire peace process was Afghan-led and owned, adding: ""We don't think that we need to facilitate the peace process, we think we need to support the peace process.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Militias in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo are uniting in opposition to President Joseph Kabila, a senior U.N. official there told a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday.
In 2017, a brutal conflict in Congo's southwestern Kasai region drew international attention and condemnation because of reports of atrocities by pro-government militias. Less attention was paid to escalating violence by armed groups in eastern provinces bordering Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Burundi and Zambia.
""What we hear is that whilst initially some of these armed groups were in it for themselves - they would burn a village, and pillage, rape, burn and scorch the earth - it seems now that they have more of a political agenda,"" said Jean-Philippe Chauzy, chief of mission for the International Organization for Migration in Congo.
""We now have it seems a coalition of various militia groups - it's a myriad, a cluster of those illegal irregular armed groups, about 70 of them at the last count, probably even more - that seem to be coalescing on the political agenda, which is one of transition without President Kabila."" 
Kabila has refused to step down, despite his mandate expiring in 2016, and has delayed an election until December 2018.
The eastern militias were hard to track, with constantly changing identities and areas of control. Chauzy said they may have benefited from the Congolese army's deployment to Kasai.
In December U.N. peacekeepers had to repel an offensive against the town of Uvira, less than 20 miles from the Burundian capital Bujumbura on Lake Tanganyika, and a similar attack could happen again, he said. 
""The assault on Uvira was not really repelled by the Congolese army but by MONUSCO, the U.N. forces in DRC, who deployed attack helicopters and sank some of those boats, because it was more of a naval assault.""
He declined to comment on remarks by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, blaming the United Nations for ""preserving terrorism"" in Congo.
Chauzy said reports of violence were continuing, with shots fired early on Wednesday around the airport in the Kasai city of Kananga, where four died in January.
Earlier this month an attack by armed groups on a military encampment in North Kivu province left ""scores dead"", a World Health Organization report said.
IOM said the humanitarian situation in Congo had reached breaking point, with a huge gap in funding, 7.7 million people suffering an acute food emergency and 4.3 million displaced.

This month flash floods hit the capital Kinshasa, killing 45 and spreading cholera.

1281,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",Hungary outlines 'Stop Soros' legislation against immigration,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's nationalist government outlined legislation on Wednesday to tackle illegal immigration that it says is undermining European stability and has been stoked in part by U.S. financier George Soros.
Right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban is embroiled in an escalating feud with Soros, who has rejected an extended Hungarian government campaign against him as ""distortions and lies"" meant to create a false external enemy.
Orban is expected to secure a third straight term in a general election due on April 8. 
The legislative package, dubbed ""Stop Soros"" by government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs, includes mandatory registration of some non-government organizations that ""support illegal immigration"", according to an emailed government position paper.
Kovacs told a news conference that a 25 percent tax would be imposed on foreign donations that such NGOs collect, and activists could face restraining orders that preclude them from approaching the EU's external borders in Hungary. Those borders have been fortified since a migrant influx in 2015.
Kovacs added that third-country nationals could also be subject to a restraining order anywhere in the country.
Details were not immediately clear as the bills will only be published and submitted for public debate on Thursday.
But pro-government media reported that the bills could lead to a ban on Soros, who has U.S. and Hungarian citizenship, entering the country.
Soros, 87, is a Hungarian-born Jew whose longtime support for liberal and open-border values in eastern Europe have put him at odds with right-wing nationalists, especially in Hungary.
Orban's government said in its position paper that it opposed migration through ""every means possible.""
""Illegal mass immigration is a problem that affects Europe as a whole, posing serious security risks,"" it said. 
Asked about implications for Soros himself, Kovacs said: ""If Soros is found to have engaged in such activity, meaning he organizes illegal immigration, then the rules will apply to him."" An aide for Kovacs declined to elaborate.
Last year, the Orban government introduced a measure requiring NGOs that get money from abroad to register with the state, raising alarm in the European Union and United States.
The European Commission said late last year it was taking Budapest to the EU's top court over its NGO laws as well as a higher education law that targets Central European University in Budapest founded by Soros.
Orban is locked in a series of running battles with the EU, where Western member states and the Brussels-based executive Commission decry what they see as his authoritarian leanings, the squeezing of the opposition and the free media.

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Suspected Boko Haram suicide bombers killed 12 people and injured 48 others in an attack on Wednesday on the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri, officials from the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) for Borno said.
In recent weeks, Nigeria's military has embarked on an offensive against the Islamist insurgency in the northeastern state of Borno, the epicenter for much of the conflict, which began in 2009. 
That has not stopped Boko Haram's attacks, which target both civilians and the military.
Two bombers struck a market in the Muna Garage area on the outskirts of Maiduguri late on Wednesday afternoon, the SEMA officials said.
Muna Garage is the site of a camp for displaced people and a frequent target of Boko Haram attacks.
In the wake of the attack, the smell of burned blood lingered while parts of the market were still ablaze, according to a Reuters witness.
On Monday, a Boko Haram faction released a video purporting to show some of the girls kidnapped from the town of Chibok nearly four years ago, as well as a downed Nigerian military aircraft and a group of policewomen abducted last year.

ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish court acquitted the jailed head of a pro-Kurdish opposition party on Wednesday of insulting the interior minister, a small victory for a man already jailed for 14 months and facing more than 142 years in prison on terrorism charges.
Appearing in an Ankara courtroom for the second time in weeks, Selahattin Demirtas dismissed his impending terrorism trials as a sham and said he had been tried in the court of public opinion by a media beholden to President Tayyip Erdogan.
""I am a lawyer of 27 years and this is not a trial. My hearings were held by the mainstream media and this is now my execution,"" Demirtas, the co-head of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), told the court.
The court acquitted him of insulting Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu in a 2015 speech, ruling that his comments were protected because he had been appealing to public opinion during a campaign.
Demirtas had accused Soylu of forming teams to train local members of the ruling AK Party to manipulate the outcome of a 2015 parliamentary election. 
""The speeches were aimed at appealing to the public during an election campaign and do not carry the properties of insult,"" the lead judge told the court.
Turkish authorities accuse Demirtas and other detained members of the HDP of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency against the state and is classed by Turkey, the United States and the European Union as a terrorist organization. They deny any links.
SECURITY CONCERNS
Wednesday's hearing was moved to a remote courthouse some 40 kilometers (25 miles) outside Ankara amid security concerns. The governor's office banned all demonstrations in the capital city on the grounds that crowds may be targeted by terrorists.
Last week Demirtas, a former human rights lawyer, made his first public appearance since his arrest, standing before an Istanbul court on charges of insulting Erdogan, in a separate case that carries an additional four years in prison.
Hundreds of supporters turned out for that trial. 
A second hearing against Demirtas scheduled for Wednesday - concerning comments he made in October 2015 insinuating that the government had had foreknowledge of deadly bombings that targeted Kurdish supporters - was adjourned until April 18th.
Court have not allowed Demirtas to attend hearings for his other cases citing security reasons, and he has refused to take part via video link.
Demirtas's HDP, the third-largest party in the Turkish parliament, has been hammered by a crackdown that followed an abortive coup in Turkey in July 2016. About 50,000 people, including soldiers, journalists, academics and civil servants, have been arrested in that crackdown. 
The HDP says as many as 5,000 of its party members have been detained, while several of its lawmakers have also been stripped of their parliamentary status.

Human rights groups and Turkey's Western allies say Erdogan has used the putsch as an excuse to quash dissent. The government says the purges are needed to thwart mounting threats to national security.

1284,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Swedish PM does not rule out use of army to end gang violence,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden will do whatever it takes, including sending in the army, to end a wave of gang violence that has seen a string of deadly shootings, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said in Wednesday.
Sweden's murder rate is relatively low in international terms, but gang violence has surged in recent years and Swedes are worried that the police are unable to cope. 
In 2016, the latest year for which official statistics are available, 106 people were murdered in Sweden, a country of 10 million.
But Swedish TV reported there were over 300 shootings, mostly in turf battles between gangs over drugs, protection rackets and prostitution. 
Four people were shot dead in the first week of this year. One man died after picking up a hand grenade outside a subway station in a suburb of Stockholm.
Law and order is likely to be a major issue in a parliamentary election scheduled for September with the populist, opposition Sweden Democrats linking public concern about the rising crime rate to a large increase in the numbers of immigrants.
""It would not be my first option to bring in the military, but I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to make sure that serious, organized crime is stamped out,"" Lofven told news agency TT.
The government has promised police an extra 7.1 billion crowns ($880 million) through 2020, toughened laws on gun crimes and made it easier for the police to monitor private phone calls and emails, among other measures.
But a report by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention shows increasing numbers of Swedes worried about crime with confidence falling in the police and the judicial system.
""People are shot to death in pizza restaurants, people are killed by hand grenades they find on the street,"" Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson said in parliament on Wednesday.

""This is the new Sweden; the new, exciting dynamic, multicultural paradise that so many here in this assembly ... have fought to create for so many years,"" he said sarcastically.

At the end of last year, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said he would redeploy some troops to North Africa from Iraq and Afghanistan, requiring parliament to reopen to give its consent, despite having already closed ahead of the March 4 national election.
Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party, which is in opposition, backed the resolution, while the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement refused its support, saying the measure would prevent whoever wins the election from setting their own foreign policy priorities.
In the resolution on foreign missions for this year, Italy plans to spend 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) on 31 missions in 21 countries. Only a portion of the funding was approved in the budget and additional money will have to be set aside by the end of September.
The focus on Africa comes as Italy is seeking to stop migrants from reaching its shores. The mostly African immigrants first cross the Sahel states to reach Libya, where they set off in boats for Italy. More than 600,000 have come in the past four years.
The Niger mission was announced on Dec. 28 as Italy joined France and the United States, which already have troops there, in efforts to help President Mahamadou Issoufou better control Niger's territory and borders. 
Gentiloni said the mission would ""guarantee stability in the area and fight illegal trafficking of migrants"".
Some 400 soldiers are expected to work in Libya, up from about 370, and, as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Italy will send 60 troops to Tunisia to improve border control and fight terrorism.
The number of troops in Afghanistan will be halved to about 750, while about 200 soldiers will be withdrawn from Iraq.

ROME (Reuters) - Britain's Cambridge University rejected on Wednesday any suggestion that one of its tutors might have been implicated in the death of graduate student Giulio Regeni, who was killed in Egypt in 2016.
Italian magistrates questioned tutor Maha Abdelrahman in Cambridge last week and seized her computer and cell phone as part of their investigation into the murder of Regeni, who was tortured and killed while carrying out research in Cairo.
While there is no suggestion that Abdelrahman was involved in his death, investigators had pushed for months to question her about why Regeni had chosen his research subject and whether she had put him in harm's way.
She has yet to speak publicly about Regeni, but Cambridge Vice-Chancellor Stephen Toope sent a message on Tuesday to university academics stoutly defending her actions.
""It is very disturbing ... to find that she has been the victim of seemingly concerted efforts to implicate her directly in Giulio's death,"" said the statement.
""Public speculation about Dr Abdelrahman's involvement in the case has been inaccurate, damaging and potentially dangerous,"" Toope added. ""It demonstrates a lack of understanding of scholarly aims and methods.""
A Cambridge spokesman said Abdelrahman was not available for comment.
Judicial sources in Rome, speaking off the record, have complained about how long it took them to organize the meeting with Abdelrahman. A senior source said Abdelrahman had shed no new light on the case last week and added that this was ""disappointing"".
Toope said both Abdelrahman and the university had repeatedly offered to help with the case. ""In light of her willingness to assist, the public campaign of denigration, fanned by political expediency, is shameful,"" he said.
Regeni had been looking into Egypt's independent labor unions for his thesis and attracted the suspicion of the Cairo government before his disappearance, sources told Reuters in 2016.
Security and intelligence sources told Reuters that Regeni was arrested in Cairo on Jan. 25, 2016, and taken into custody. His disfigured body was found in a ditch more than a week later. Egyptian officials have denied any involvement in his killing.
Italian media have quoted anonymous sources as saying the magistrates were interested in whether Abdelrahman played a role in commissioning Regeni to research the delicate topic and whether she had warned him of the danger.
A senior Italian legal source told Reuters the tutor had told magistrates Regeni had picked his own research subject. 
Toope said Regeni was ""an experienced researcher"" who knew Egypt and spoke fluent Arabic.
""It is not uncommon for academic research in the humanities and social sciences to impinge on politically sensitive issues,"" he said. ""He was using standard academic methods to study trade unions in Egypt.""
Toope said Cambridge would continue to assist investigators, saying the university wanted to see justice for Regeni and also the reputation of its scholars safeguarded.

""This brutal killing calls for justice. But justice will not be served by undermining the very thing that drove Giulio in his brief but inspiring academic career, the search for truth.""

The suspects are accused of fraudulently obtaining Polish tourist visas for Syrians so they could fly to Poland from the Gulf and then cross into Germany to apply for asylum, said spokesman Markus Pfau. 
A third suspect could be detained later on Wednesday, he said.
Immigration remains a politically charged issue in Germany after Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to open the doors to more than one million migrants and refugees in 2015 and 2016. 
Merkel has vowed to prevent a repeat of the unprecedented flows that overwhelmed Europe's border controls at that time and numbers have fallen sharply, but Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said on Tuesday they were still too high. [nL1N1PB0K6]
Wednesday's raids targeted 15 sites in Berlin and six other states as part of a joint German-Polish investigation launched in spring 2017.
The investigation, aided by Polish border authorities, found the gang was charging 8,000 euros ($9,778.40) per person to obtain a visa, and had earned a total of more than 300,000 euros ($366,690.00).
Germany's de Maiziere said the successful raids showed the importance of border controls, adding that Poland had also taken additional measures. He did not elaborate. 
About 48,000 asylum seekers from Syria arrived in Germany in 2017, according to data published on Tuesday, adding to almost half a million Syrian refugees who arrived in the previous two years.

The fighting erupted on Monday after one of the city's many armed groups launched an attack at Mitiga Airport in an apparent effort to secure the release of prisoners held in an adjacent prison. At least 20 people were killed and 60 wounded.
""Mitiga's air space remains closed and it is up to the authorities to decide when it will be reopened,"" the airport administration said in a short statement on Wednesday.
Petro Air, which operates flights to Libyan oil fields, also said all its flights at Mitiga were still suspended. 
A number of planes parked there were damaged during the clashes, including an A319 Airbus belonging to Afriqiyah Airlines, an Airbus A330 operated by Libyan Airlines, two Boeings operated to Buraq Air, and two jets operated by Libya Wings.

Some aircraft were moved for safety reasons across the capital to Tripoli's international airport, which has been closed since 2014 due to damage from earlier fighting.

1290,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 11:23AM ET</span>",Palestinian teen ordered held until end of Israeli military trial,"By Ali Sawafta
OFER PRISON, West Bank (Reuters) - A 16-year-old Palestinian girl, hailed as a hero by Palestinians for hitting and kicking Israeli soldiers outside her home, will remain in detention until the end of her trial for alleged assault, an Israeli military court ruled on Wednesday.
Ahed Tamimi was arrested after she was filmed confronting an Israeli officer and a soldier outside her home in a village in the occupied West Bank on December 15 following what Israel says was a stone-throwing assault on its troops.
A video of the encounter showed Tamimi slapping an officer and punching a soldier next to him in the face. Both men, who were also kicked by the teenager, wore helmets and combat gear and tried to deflect her blows, but remained largely passive.
The soldiers had deployed during a weekly Palestinian protest in the village against Israeli policy on settlements in the West Bank, one of the most heated issues in efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, frozen since 2014. 
London-based Amnesty International noted the altercation took place on the same day Tamimi's 15-year-old cousin was hit in the head by a rubber bullet fired by an Israeli soldier.
Right-wing Israelis have debated whether the troops had appeared weak by opting not to strike back. The Israeli army said they acted professionally by showing restraint.
The case has made Tamimi into a potent symbol for Palestinians, and a commentator in the Israeli left-wing newspaper Haaretz said Israel risked turning her into the ""Palestinian Joan of Arc"".
Charges filed on Jan. 1 against Tamimi included aggravated assault, rock-throwing, incitement and participation in ""violent riots"". No plea was entered at the hearing. 
Tamimi's lawyer, Gaby Lasky, said the court, convening at Israel's Ofer prison near the Palestinian city of Ramallah, dismissed arguments that continued detention would violate Tamimi's rights as a minor and concluded she would pose a danger if released on bail.
""They decided the trial will begin on the thirty-first of January, but although she is only sixteen years old, the court believes that her indictment is enough to keep her in detention until the end of the trial,"" the attorney told reporters.
An adult found guilty of assaulting a soldier could be jailed for up to 10 years, but such an outcome would be unlikely for a minor.
Calling for Tamimi's release, Amnesty said on Monday that nothing Tamimi had done against armed soldiers wearing protective gear ""can justify the continuing detention of a 16-year-old girl"".
Tamimi, whose father is a prominent Palestinian activist, made news two years ago when she was pictured biting a soldier who tried to arrest her younger brother.
Palestinians want the West Bank for a future state, along with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Most countries consider as illegal the Israeli settlements built in the territory which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

Israel disputes that its settlements are illegal and says their future should be determined in peace talks with the Palestinians.

1291,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Two-year race for top ECB jobs start next week,"By Balazs Koranyi and Jan Strupczewski
FRANKFURT/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone officials could pick a new European Central Bank vice president within weeks, kicking off two years of flux at the top of one of Europe's most vital institutions and previewing a tussle to replace ECB chief Mario Draghi in 2019.
Germany is seen as eager to claim the presidency at last, two decades after the ECB's creation, but the hawkish views of its obvious candidate, Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, will count against him in some member states, euro zone sources say.
Also, women seem unlikely to claim either of the two top jobs in a male-dominated institution, and whatever the outcome, the reshuffle must be conducted alongside the delicate task of raising interest rates and unwinding a 2.55 trillion euro money-printing program without provoking an upheaval on markets.
Having played a leading role in fighting off the euro zone's debt crisis, the ECB has been a pillar of the bloc's five-year economic recovery and changes in its executive and supervisory boards could test its role as an anchor of trust in European Union institutions. 
Draghi relied on the ECB's - and his own - credibility in 2012 when he promised to do 'whatever it takes' to preserve the euro. Then three years later he presided over the launch of the scheme to stimulate growth by flooding the financial system with cash via bond purchases.
In doing this, he was arguably the key figure in holding the 19-member currency bloc together in its darkest hour. When the Italian completes his non-renewable, eight-year term in November 2019, his successor will be in the spotlight from day one. 
First to go at the bank will be Vice President Vitor Constancio of Portugal in May, followed next year by bank supervisor Daniele Nouy, chief economist Peter Praet, Draghi himself, and executive board member Benoit Coeure.
Finance ministers will launch the process to choose a new vice president on Monday and may make a decision in February. This could offer clues about political positions in the contest to replace Draghi, euro zone officials told Reuters. 
Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos, so far the only publicly known candidate, is favorite for the number two job. With EU spoils shared around the regions, selecting a southern European would signal that Draghi's job will go to northern Europe, possibly Germany, the officials, who asked not to be named, said. 
One source noted that the chair of the euro zone finance ministers' group has just passed to a Portuguese.
""Southern Europe got the Eurogroup presidency so if they also get Constancio's job, then Draghi's position would have to go north to keep the regional balance,"" the source said. ""Then, it's likely to be France and Germany fighting it out.""
GERMANS
Picking the Bundesbank chief for the ECB presidency may be tricky, even though Germany is Europe's biggest economy and Weidmann is considered a top-notch central banker.
He has alienated some officials with his opposition to the ECB's ultra easy monetary policy, which is credited with reviving economic growth. Some regarded this as disloyalty in a time of crisis.
The ECB has to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in unwinding that policy and raising rates from record lows without major dislocation.
Weidmann has also ruffled some political feathers, engaging in public exchanges with former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi by criticizing Rome's performance in cutting its debt.
After joining the losing side in the ECB's biggest decisions to stimulate the economy, Weidmann could also struggle to unite the Governing Council, which rarely takes votes and strives for the broadest possible consensus. 
""De Guindos is a done deal (for the vice presidency),"" another source said. ""But while Germany might have a claim on the Draghi job, Weidmann is considered too hawkish. So some people say a German 'yes', but Weidmann 'no',"" a further euro zone official said.
That would leave Berlin with three options: fight for Weidmann, select another German or give up the ECB and seek top jobs at the European Commission. The positions of the president, foreign policy chief and economic and monetary affairs chief all come up next year.
Other Germans touted by analysts and euro zone sources as potential candidates include European Stability Mechanism managing director Klaus Regling, university professor Volker Wieland and Marcel Fratzscher, the head of economic research institute DIW Berlin. 
Weidmann has often said that a discussion about succession was premature and nationality should not affect the decision. No candidate has publicly expressed interest in Draghi's job.
FRANCE?
French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau, a German speaker with extensive ties to Germany, is also a potential candidate to replace Draghi. Villeroy is seen as acceptable to German Chancellor Angela Merkel but France has already occupied the ECB presidency, meaning he would face an uphill battle. 
In a possible compromise, Dutchman Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the outgoing Eurogroup head, could also be considered, some of the sources said.
Another factor is the dearth of high ranking female policymakers. Only two women serve on the 25-member rate-setting Governing Council and one of them, Sabine Lautenschlaeger, would have to quit if a fellow German replaced Draghi. This would be to avoid having two people from the same country sitting on the executive board.
Lautenschlaeger, a specialist in bank regulation, could not take the top job either as under ECB rules, the president must come from outside the board on which she already sits. 
Possible women that may be considered for board seats include Irish central bank Deputy Governor Sharon Donnery, Italian economist Lucrezia Reichlin or France's Sylvie Goulard.

The ECB also needs a new chief economist next year with Irish central bank chief Philip Lane and Estonia's Ardo Hansson mentioned as potential candidates. In a nod to smaller member states, Finland's Olli Rehn - widely seen as a successor to central bank chief Erkki Liikanen - could be considered for a board position, the sources said.

Mark Weber, director of the California-based Institute for Historical Review, has questioned the scale of the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were killed.
""You are the subject of an exclusion decision taken personally by the Home Secretary on 28 April 2015 on Unacceptable Behaviour ground,"" the letter to Weber dated Dec. 22 from Britain's Home Office said.
Prime Minister Theresa May, who became premier in 2016 amid political turmoil prompted by a shock referendum vote to leave the European Union, was Home Secretary at the time of the decision.
""She personally directed that you should be excluded from the United Kingdom on the grounds that your presence here is not conductive to the public good,"" according to the 2015 decision. 
The Home Office said it had no address for him when the decision was first made.
Weber said he learned he was banned from entering Britain while waiting at Madrid's airport to board a flight to London, where he intended to change planes for a flight to Los Angeles.
In a letter emailed to the Home Office, Weber said that the quotes attributed to him by the ministry were ""second hand information that is, at least in part, inaccurate, untrue or distorted"". 
Weber in a 2009 article entitled ""How Relevant is Holocaust Revisionism?"" said he had devoted much time to critically reviewing the what he termed the Holocaust narrative. 
But he said Holocaust revisionism had proved to be a hindrance to the real struggle against what he called ""Jewish-Zionist"" power.

1296,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Police search offices of Belgian company supplying passports to Africa,"By Philippe Engels and David Lewis
BRUSSELS/NAIROBI (Reuters) - Police on Wednesday searched the headquarters of Belgian company Semlex, which supplies passports to various African countries, and the home of its CEO, Albert Karaziwan. About a dozen officers arrived at Semlex's office in Brussels and at Karaziwan's house in the city early in the morning. By early afternoon, the search was still continuing.
A spokesman for Belgium's federal prosecutor said: ""We are carrying out those searches in a case of possible money laundering and corruption."" He declined to give further details.
Karaziwan did not comment when contacted by telephone. ""Stop your dramas ... Thank you and goodbye,"" he said before hanging up. A lawyer for Semlex did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
Earlier this week, authorities in the Comoros Islands, an archipelago off the east coast of Africa where Semlex has supplied identity documents since 2007, canceled 170 passports that the government said had been improperly issued to foreigners, including many Iranians. The passports, supplied by Semlex, had been issued between 2013 and 2016 by a previous government.
The current government of the Comoros last week also withdrew a diplomatic passport issued to Karaziwan by a previous administration that had appointed him a roving ambassador.
The action by authorities in Belgium and the Comoros follows two Reuters reports examining the activities of Semlex in Africa, where the private Belgian firm has landed contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
Semlex and Karaziwan did not respond to requests for comment on those reports. In December, when the second report was published, Francois Koning, a lawyer representing Semlex, said Reuters was being manipulated by a third party trying to damage the company.
Last April, Reuters detailed how Semlex won a contract to produce biometric passports in Democratic Republic of Congo. The deal greatly increased the price citizens have to pay for passports, and documents showed a Gulf company owned by a relative of Congo's president received a significant chunk of the revenues. The Congolese presidency did not respond to Reuters inquiries on that story.
Soon afterwards, Belgian prosecutors said they were investigating the deal.
In December, Reuters examined Semlex's operations in other African nations, in particular the Comoros. According to emails, contracts and other documents seen by Reuters, Semlex secured deals through political connections, at times without going through public tenders, and sometimes while making payments to intermediaries. Karaziwan was involved in the sale of Comoros citizenship via a Dubai-based company, according to sources familiar with the matter and documents seen by Reuters.
A week after the article was published, Semlex issued a statement saying it had no role in the issuing of passports. It said that role was purely the prerogative of the local authorities. 
Comoros authorities continue to investigate the matter. The government said it has sought help from Interpol and the United States for more information about some foreigners who had bought Comoros passports. At least two buyers of Comoros passports were people alleged by U.S. authorities to have violated sanctions against Iran, Reuters found. Reuters could not determine how these individuals secured the passports.
Between 5,000 and 10,000 Comoros passports may have been bought by foreigners who underwent minimal vetting, a Western diplomat in the region told Reuters this week. ""There was no way of knowing who people were,"" the official said. ""We are concerned this is being used to skirt Iranian sanctions."" 
A list of Comoros passports canceled this week indicates that many were held by Iranian-born foreigners.

1297,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>","Defend culture but shun violence, pope tells Chile's indigenous Mapuche","By Philip Pullella and Rodrigo Charme
TEMUCO, Chile (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged Chile's indigenous Mapuche people on Wednesday to shun violence, saying unity was the best weapon against ""the deforestation of hope,"" as they struggle to defend their culture and reclaim ancestral lands.
""Violence eventually turns a most just cause into a lie,"" he told an exuberant crowd of about 150,000 mostly Mapuche on a military airfield in southern Chile.
In the run-up to his visit, the Araucania region that is the heartland of the Mapuche has been hit by repeated attacks by protesters who have burned or bombed churches, logging trucks and schoolhouses. On the morning of Francis' arrival, a church, a schoolhouse and three helicopters used to fight fires in the heavily forested region were set on fire.
Groups tied to Mapuche causes have claimed responsibility for past attacks, though it is not clear to what extent they have broader support among indigenous communities and there was no sign of dissent in Wednesday's joyful crowd.
At the start of a Mass, Mapuche dressed in traditional garb of colorful weaved ponchos and headbands made of silver trinkets played indigenous wind instruments and small drums.
They chanted and danced before the altar as if to bless and welcome the important visitor and during the Mass a traditional horn was used instead of bells to accompany the most sacred parts of the liturgy.
""A culture of mutual esteem may not be based on acts of violence and destruction that end up taking human lives,"" Francis said after starting his homily with the Mapuche phrases for ""Good morning"" and ""Peace be with you.""
ANCIENT GLORY, MODERN POVERTY
Indigenous communities of south-central Chile have long accused the state and private companies of taking their ancestral land, stripping it of natural resources and using heavy-handed enforcement against their communities.
Around 600,000 Mapuche live in Chile, many in the forested, hilly provinces ringed by volcanoes and lakes of Araucania and Bio Bio, roughly 400 miles (650 km) south of Santiago.
""Solidarity ... is the only weapon we have against the 'deforestation of hope,"" Francis said. He quoted national poets on the struggles of Chileans and the beauty of their land.
Mapuche relations with the state and settlers of European descent have been fractious since the Chilean army invaded the territory of the Mapuche in the late 19th century.
""I hope that the pope gives us the opportunity to tell the world our story,"" said Isolde Reuque, a Mapuche leader from Temuco. ""It's the Chilean government that needs to resolve our problems, not the pope.""
Francis, whose homily was interrupted repeatedly by applause and at times by the blowing of tribal instruments, asked for a moment of silence for those who had suffered ""so much pain and injustice"" in the past.
Last year, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet asked for forgiveness from the Mapuche community for such ""errors and horrors."" 
Her government accelerated a land transfer program that gives property titles to indigenous communities, and launched initiatives to improve infrastructure and access to drinking water in remote areas.
Still, the Araucania region that is home to the majority of the country's Mapuche is the poorest in the country, with nearly a quarter of its residents living below the poverty line, according to a 2015 survey by Chile's Ministry of Social Development.
A recent, high-profile hunger strike by four Mapuche men accused of setting fire to an evangelical church in 2016 raised the profile of the issue among Chileans.
The Maquehue airfield near Temuco, where the pope celebrated Mass on Wednesday, was one of the principal detention and torture centers of the Araucania region during the early days of the 1973-1990 dictatorship of the late Augusto Pinochet after the overthrow of democratically elected President Salvador Allende. 
""(This place) was the site of grave violations of human rights. We offer this Mass for all those who suffered and died, and for those who daily bear the burden of those many injustices,"" Francis said.

After the Mass, Francis was sharing a meal with Mapuche representatives before he was due to return to the Chilean capital to meet young people and university students.

The program was helping Kenya plant trees, restore degraded land and protect water catchment areas in highland forests, which are major sources of water that flows into Lake Victoria and the Nile basin.
Stefano Dejak, the EU ambassador to Kenya, said Tuesday's killing of the man, and the shooting of another, in Embobut forest in the west of the country, came after the bloc had told the government it would reconsider financial support if the use of force against innocent locals persisted. 
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported on its website that three UN Special Rapporteurs had expressed concerns about the recent reports of evictions of Sengwer inhabitants, the EU said in a statement.
It said the dead man was a member of the Sengwer, an indigenous group in the area. 
""The conservation work on the water towers was never expected to involve any evictions or use of violence,"" it said in a statement.
Judi Wakhungu, the Kenyan minister of environment and natural resources, said she did not have a formal report of the incident the EU referred to. 
There was a security operation led by the ministry of the interior in the area to flush out cattle rustlers, criminal elements and militias who hide in the forest, she said. 
""We are going to assess how exactly we can improve the prevailing security situation... Thereafter we will see how we can move the project forward once we are satisfied that normalcy has returned,"" she told Reuters, adding the EU would be involved.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 10:18AM ET</span>",Top German Social Democrats urge party to back coalition talks with Merkel,"By Michelle Martin
BERLIN (Reuters) - Leading German Social Democrats (SPD) urged delegates on Tuesday to back coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and warned that shunning another tie-up would further damage the party's already dire ratings.
SPD members will vote on Sunday on whether to back full-blown coalition talks with the conservatives. Last week they agreed to a coalition blueprint but some in the party have bashed, saying it does not bear sufficient hallmarks of their party and that they would be better off in opposition.
The SPD leadership has unanimously agreed to recommend they be given a mandate to pursue coalition talks.
SPD General Secretary Lars Klingbeil told Die Zeit newspaper's online edition that he understood the widespread scepticism in his party about agreeing to a re-run of the 'grand coalition' that governed Germany in the last four years, but warned against the alternative.
""Before voting at the party congress SPD delegates should be aware that there are only two realistic scenarios: negotiating further or new elections,"" he said.
The SPD had planned to reinvent itself in opposition after a poor election showing in September but was persuaded to enter coalition talks with the conservatives when Merkel's attempt to form a coalition with two smaller parties failed in November.
The latest INSA poll showed the SPD slipping to 18.5 percent, its worst ever result in that particular survey, and weaker still than the 20.5 percent it fetched in September's election - which was its poorest post-war performance. 
Merkel needs the SPD to back the alliance if she is to shore up a fourth term after 12 years at the helm. Refusal by SPD delegates to hold further talks could lead to new elections or a minority Merkel-led government for the first time in the post-war era. 
Edgar Franke, a spokesman for the SPD's conservative ""Seeheimer Kreis"" wing, said if his party refused to join a grand coalition, it risked sliding to 15 or 16 percent in a new election.
""And it won't recover from that in the long term,"" Franke told Focus magazine.
The most divisive issues for the two blocs concern taxes, pensions, migration and healthcare but both parties are aware that a grand coalition is one of the last options on the table.
The coalition question has split the SPD, with branches in Berlin and the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt recommending their members vote against, and Brandenburg and Hamburg in favor of coalition talks.
Those against also argue that such an arrangement would allow the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) to become the largest opposition party. 
Nevertheless there is a consensus at the top of the party that it should enter formal coalition talks, and this received a boost on Wednesday when a dozen SPD mayors from big cities called on delegates to vote in favor.
""We should not reject the opportunity to form Social Democratic policies for people, which is contingent upon participating in government,"" the mayors in a joint statement. 
SPD leader Martin Schulz has gone on a charm offensive in the biggest state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) to get its backing for talks but Norbert Roemer, head of the SPD's parliamentary group there, said results of the exploratory talks did not make clear enough that there would be a fresh start. 
He told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung: ""In our party - and this is true of me too - there's a lot of mistrust of Ms Merkel and her troops.""
Paul Ziemiak, head of the conservatives' youth wing, urged the SPD to agree to a grand coalition, telling Tagesspiegel newspaper the SPD needed to stop talking about itself and adding: ""Our country is at stake.""

PRISTINA (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to Kosovo warned the country's leaders on Wednesday they would bear harsh consequences if parliament votes to scrap a war crimes court linked to its violent independence struggle.
A parliamentary committee, meanwhile, put off decision on whether to put forward a vote to scrap legislation on setting up the court, which would try ethnic Albanians accused of war crimes against Serbs during the 1998-99 conflict.
The initiative was previously shelved in December under U.S. and European Union pressure, but since revived. 
U.S. Ambassador Greg Delawie told reporters that the initiative was ""a terrible example"" of self-centered interests prevailing ""over the common good and Kosovo's interests"".
""The politicians ... despite their denials, would be subject to specific and harsh consequences should the initiative succeed,"" Delawie said.
Last week the European Union warned Kosovo - which aspires to closer links with the EU - that its relations with the bloc would suffer if it scrapped the law.
German and French envoys lobbied Kosovo leaders in Pristina last week not to abolish the Specialist Chamber set up in 2015 to try ex-Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) guerrillas for alleged atrocities in the war that led to independence from Serbia.
Proponents of doing away with the court say it is mandated only to prosecute ethnic Albanians and that it would duplicate the work of other courts dealing with war crimes during the 1990s break-up of old Yugoslavia.
Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, President Hashim Thaci and parliamentary speaker Kadri Veseli are former KLA commanders and could potentially be indicted by the court or called as witnesses, some Kosovo Albanian media reported.
""Kosovo needs to be willing to close this chapter of history even if it means holding some of its wartime leaders to account,"" Delawie told reporters.
A 2011 report for the Council of Europe linked leading Kosovo figures – notably Thaci – to gruesome crimes against Serbs, including trade in organs harvested from prisoners of war. Thaci has denied any wrongdoing.
The court, based abroad in The Hague to minimise the risk of witness intimidation and judicial corruption, has yet to hear any cases.

The United States is Kosovo's staunchest ally but Pristina also hopes for eventual association with the EU. To that end, the EU has told Pristina it must first root out rampant corruption and organized crime, prosecute war crimes and normalize relations with its neighbors including Serbia.

MITROVICA, Kosovo (Reuters) - More than 2,000 people gathered in Kosovo's northern town of Mitrovica on Wednesday to pay respects to a Serb leader whose killing inflamed tensions between the neighbors. 
Oliver Ivanovic, 64, was shot dead with six bullets on Tuesday in front of his party office in Mitrovica, a town bitterly divided between ethnic Serbs and Albanians. 
He was facing a retrial over the killings of ethnic Albanians during the 1998-99 war. Serbia condemned the killing as an act of terrorism but the president declined to say whether he believed the killing was ethnically motivated.
Ivanovic came to prominence shortly after the war as one of the Mitrovica ""bridge-watchers"", Serbs who sought to prevent ""infiltration"" by Albanians over the Ibar River bridge into the northern half of the town.
Kosovo Serbs, mainly from Mitrovica, gathered at Ivanovic's party office on Wednesday, lighting candles before they escorted his coffin to the outskirts of the town, from where a car will take it to Belgrade where the funeral will take place.
A Serbian Orthodox church bishop held a service before the procession left. A man holding a wooden cross with Ivanovic's name on it led the procession through the streets of Mitrovica. 
""Every single person who wants normalcy and the city to be without crime and political crime and pressure and insecurity came to bid farewell to Oliver,"" said Spomenka, 40, an office clerk, who declined to give her family name.
An EU-sponsored dialogue on the normalization of ties between Serbia and Kosovo was suspended on Belgrade's request after the killing. A Serbian official said they only would go back to negotiations once the penetrator was brought to justice. 
The European Union, NATO and the United States urged Serbia and its former province, which won independence a decade ago, to recommit to establishing normal relations, key for both countries to progress toward EU accession. 
""Ivanovic’s murder yesterday was a tragedy for Kosovo,"" the U.S. ambassador to Kosovo, Greg Delawie, told journalists. ""No one should take advantage of this crime for political ends."" 
POLICE INVESTIGATION
Kosovo police said they had tracked down the owners of a burned car believed to be linked to killers and were interviewing potential witnesses. No one heard shots as, according to investigators, the gunman likely used silencer.
Autopsy results released on Wednesday showed he had been shot with six bullets.
Bridge-watchers such as Ivanovic were often involved in ethnic violence in the early post-war period, after NATO air strikes drove out Serbian forces accused of killing and expelling Kosovo Albanian civilians in a counter-insurgency campaign.
After the group disbanded, Ivanovic entered politics and became known for advocating dialogue and compromise with Kosovo Albanians, while still rejecting Kosovo's sovereignty. 
In 2016 he was sentenced to nine years in prison for killing Albanians during the 1998-99 war, but was released last year after a retrial was ordered. The retrial was ongoing.
Serbian officials dismissed the accusations against Ivanovic and said the process against him was staged.
For years the north of Kosovo with up to 50,000 Serbs, functioned in a legal limbo, part of Kosovo but de facto under the control of Serbia in defiance of Kosovo's NATO and European Union overseers.

Florian Bieber, Florian Bieber, a Balkans expert at the University of Graz, said the impact of Ivanovic's murder would ""depend on how it will be instrumentalized and used"".

JERUSALEM/GAZA (Reuters) - A cut in U.S. funding for a U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees will affect regional security and could put vital health, educational and food services at risk, its chief said on Wednesday, adding he would appeal for world donations.
Washington said on Tuesday it would provide $60 million to the U.N. Relief and Welfare Agency while keeping back a further $65 million for now. The U.S. State Department said UNRWA needed to make unspecified reforms.
Palestinians, already angered by U.S. President Donald Trump's Dec. 6 recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, denounced the decision, which could deepen hardship in the Gaza Strip.
At one of UNRWA's food distribution centers in Gaza, Palestinians loaded sacks of flour, sugar and rice, canned food and oil into cars and onto donkey carts and spoke of harder times ahead.
""I live on food aid,"" said Bassam Inshasi, a father of seven. ""The situation is already difficult and it will become more difficult.""
More than half of the two million people in the Gaza Strip, where the unemployment rate is 46 percent, are dependent on support from UNRWA and other humanitarian agencies.
UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krähenbühl said he would appeal to other donor nations for money and launch ""a global fundraising campaign"" aimed at keeping the agency's schools and clinics for refugees open through 2018 and beyond.
""At stake is the dignity and human security of millions of Palestine refugees, in need of emergency food assistance and other support in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and the West Bank and Gaza Strip,"" he said in a statement. 
Krähenbühl said 525,000 boys and girls in 700 UNRWA schools could be affected by the fund cut, as well as Palestinian access to primary health care, but he pledged to keep facilities open through 2018 and beyond.
""The reduced contribution also impacts regional security at a time when the Middle East faces multiple risks and threats, notably that of further radicalization,"" he said.
UNRWA was established by the U.N. General Assembly in 1949 after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war that followed Israel’s creation. It says it currently aids five million registered Palestinian refugees in the Middle East.
TRUMP THREAT 
In a Twitter post on Jan. 2, Trump said that Washington gives the Palestinians ""HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect."" Trump added that ""with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?""
While U.S. officials did not link the decision to Trump's tweet, they made a point often advanced by him, saying the United States had been UNRWA’s single largest donor for decades.
Trump's aides initially debated whether to cut off all UNRWA aid, an unidentified U.S. official said, but those opposed argued that could further destabilize the region.
""Any reduction of U.S. aid to UNRWA will not succeed in imposing the American positions, which are biased in favor of the occupation,"" the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, referring to Israel, said in a statement.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has called for a gradual cut in UNRWA funding and transferring its responsibilities to the U.N. global refugee agency, voiced measured support for the U.S. step.
But he appeared to acknowledge it could leave Israel - which maintains tight restrictions on the movement of people and goods across its border with Hamas Islamist-controlled Gaza - with a potential humanitarian crisis on its doorstep.
Netanyahu this month proposed gradually dismantling UNRWA, arguing it ""perpetuates the Palestinian problem"", and moving funds to the UNHCR agency. UNRWA said the Palestinian refugee crisis stems from the failure of Israel and the Palestinians to agree a solution for Palestinian refugees. [L8N1P206F]

Asked on Wednesday by Israeli reporters accompanying him on a diplomatic trip to India whether he supports the U.S. funding cut, Netanyahu said: ""Of course, but I still suggest, because I think there are certain needs, to do what I have said ... every step taken also contains some risk.""

1303,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",Germany and Poland look to experts on reparations row,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany and Poland said on Wednesday they would consider setting up a commission to explore Polish calls for reparations for German actions during World War Two.
Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has revived the issue of war compensation although the government has stopped short of making an official demand.
New Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz and his German counterpart, Sigmar Gabriel, said at their first meeting they did not want the issue to harm bilateral relations.
Both ministers stressed the importance of the relationship between the neighbors and EU partners but acknowledged that the question of reparations was not going away.
""We have a clear legal position that all questions about reparations have been cleared up,"" Gabriel said, adding that Poland's democratically elected government accepted that in the early 1990s after the fall of Communism.
""But there is no point in talking about the legal situation if there is a debate within society in a neighboring country,"" he said. 
""One way ahead could be to ask experts to look at this,"" he said, making clear there was no concrete plan so far and the makeup of such a panel would have to be decided but it may constitute historians and lawyers.
Six million Poles, including three million Polish Jews were killed during the war and the capital Warsaw was razed to the ground in 1944 after a failed uprising in which 200,000 civilians died. 
After the war, the victorious Allies awarded Poland a large swathe of German land as compensation for Polish territory annexed by the Soviet Union in the east. 
""We want to have this debate,"" said Czaputowicz, who said he accepted Gabriel's suggestion. 
Relations between Poland and Germany have improved in recent years but have taken a knock since the nationalist-leaning PiS won a parliamentary election in 2015. 

The PiS, which says Berlin wields too much influence within the European Union, frequently talks about Poland's suffering under the German occupation in an effort it says aims to promote patriotism.

During exchanges in Strasbourg, Varadkar rejected an accusation by the UK Independence Party's Nigel Farage that he was conspiring with the likes of former British premier Tony Blair to thwart Britain's departure from the European Union by resisting London's efforts to keep full access to EU markets.
Varadkar cited close cultural ties between Ireland and Britain, including his own immediate family, as a reason why he was arguing for the closest possible relationship between the EU and Britain after Brexit next year. But he insisted London could not keep EU rights while rejecting some of its obligations.
""I'm certainly not party to any plot against the United Kingdom,"" he told reporters. ""I'm a friend of the United Kingdom.""
Farage, the former UKIP leader who still leads the party in the EU legislature, accused Varadkar of risking Irish trade with Britain out of loyalty to an EU integration project which he said would unravel further after Brexit. He suggested Varadkar was pushing for Britain to reverse its referendum vote to leave.
Having revived debate in Britain this month about a second referendum by saying he believed that one was increasingly likely, Farage noted how Ireland reversed its veto of the EU's Lisbon Treaty by holding a second referendum in 2009:
""You are part of course of a big attempt here and elsewhere to frustrate and to attempt to overturn Brexit,"" he told Varadkar. ""I don’t want a second referendum on Brexit. Absolutely not. But I fear that you are all working together with Tony Blair and Nick Clegg to make sure we get the worst possible deal.""
Varadkar told reporters he had never met Blair though had encountered Clegg, a former deputy prime minister. He insisted, however, that it would be counter-productive for him as a foreigner to tell Britons what they should do.
Nonetheless, he added, Ireland had reversed referendum decisions before, including to overturn a ban on divorce, and might soon reverse a previous referendum vote curbing abortion:
""I don't think it's anti-democratic for anyone to change their mind or have a second vote. But any decision on the second referendum must only be one for the UK parliament and the UK people.""
British Prime Minister Theresa May, who campaigned against Brexit in 2016, has insisted that she will see it through, despite a flurry of statements this week by EU leaders that they would welcome Britain changing its mind. 

During an earlier debate in Strasbourg on Wednesday, EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker said he would also welcome Britain applying to re-join the bloc in the future.

1306,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Vandal-proof statue of Thatcher outside UK parliament could be rejected again,"LONDON (Reuters) - A second attempt to erect a statue of Britain's former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher outside parliament, just six months after a first proposal was thrown out over vandalism fears, looks set to fail after officials recommended it be rejected.
The life-size-and-a-half statue of Thatcher by sculptor Douglas Jennings would be erected on a climb-proof four-meter plinth and could be quickly boarded up if needed.
""Sockets have been placed in the granite plinth to accommodate scaffold poles to allow the statue to be more easily encased in hoardings during demonstrations or other potentially sensitive times,"" Westminster City Council planning officers noted in a summary of the proposal.
Thatcher, who ruled Britain from 1979-1990, died after suffering a stroke in 2013. She was the country’s first woman premier, its longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century, and won three consecutive national elections for the Conservative Party.
But her attempts to arrest Britain's post-war decline by smashing the trade unions and privatizing the country's national assets made her a deeply divisive figure.
Another sculpture of her was decapitated in 2002 at Guildhall Art Gallery in London by a man who attacked it with a metal pole.
The proposed new 300,000-pound ($414,000) work was commissioned by the Public Memorials Appeal charity after Thatcher's death.
But council officials said objections had been received on the basis of possible vandalism, that the subject was too divisive to have a statue erected in her honor and that there was already a statue of Thatcher in the nearby House of Commons.
They recommended that the council's planning sub-committee reject the proposal when it meets next week on the grounds that it also contravenes guidelines on the number of statues in the area and the policy that 10 years should elapse between the death of a subject and the erection of a statue.
""The proposed statue should therefore only proceed if there is an exceptionally good reason to justify exemption to our normal guidance,"" they wrote.

If approved, however, it would be the second statue of a woman in Parliament Square (NYSE:SQ) after this year's planned unveiling of a monument to suffrage campaigner Dame Millicent Fawcett.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the home of Mahatma Gandhi on Wednesday, saying modern India's founding father and promoter of peace was an inspiration for humanity.
Netanyahu is making the first visit by an Israeli prime minister in 15 years and the nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has rolled out the red carpet, seeing Israel as an ally in the fight against terrorism.
Modi hosted the Israeli leader in his home state of Gujarat where hundreds of people waving Indian and Israeli flags lined up the streets as the motorcade passed.
The two men, accompanied by Netanyahu's wife, Sara, went to Gandhi's ashram on the banks of a river where Netanyahu tried his hand at a spinning wheel, a pastime Gandhi made popular while he was jailed during British colonial rule. 
""An inspiring visit to the hearth of one of humanity's great prophets of inspiration - Mahatma Gandhi"", Netanyahu and his wife wrote in the guest book.
Netanyahu and Modi have pledged to deepen economic and security ties in a more open embrace of the relationship which New Delhi had long kept at a low profile, largely for fear of upsetting Arab nations on which it depends for oil. 
Modi said India's cooperation with Israel was diverse and benefited both countries. On Tuesday, Netanyahu said the two countries were discussing ways to strengthen cooperation to fight the menace of radical Islam that they both faced.
On Thursday, Netanyahu will travel to Mumbai to join a memorial event for the parents of an 11-year-old Israeli boy who was among the 166 people killed during an attack by Pakistan-based militants in 2008. 
Ahead of that trip, a small group of people staged a protest in Mumbai holding placards denouncing Netanyahu and accusing him of atrocities against Palestinians.
Arabs and Muslims across the Middle East, the European Union and the United Nations have all opposed the U.S. President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital last month as an incendiary move in a volatile region and Palestinians said Washington was abandoning its leading role as a peace mediator.
Israel, by contrast, applauded Trump's move. Netanyahu said it was ""an important step towards peace"" and it was ""our goal from Israel's first day"".

CARACAS/SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela (Reuters) - A wave of looting by hungry mobs across Venezuela has left streets of shuttered shops in provincial towns and pushed some store owners to arm themselves with guns and machetes, stirring fear that the turmoil could spread to the capital Caracas.
Worsening food shortages and runaway inflation have unleashed the spate of pillaging since Christmas in the South American country, in which seven people have reportedly died.
The unrest was sparked by shortages of pork for traditional holiday meals, despite socialist President Nicolas Maduro's promise of subsidized meat to alleviate shortages. 
Looters have ransacked trucks, supermarkets and liquor stores across the nation of 30 million people, which ranks as one of the most violent in the world.
The plunder is heaping more pain on battered businesses, raising questions about how much longer they can survive. Venezuela, once one of Latin America's richest countries, is suffering a fifth straight year of recession and the world's highest inflation rate, which the opposition-run Congress says topped 2,600 percent last year. 
In the first 11 days of January alone, some 107 lootings or attempted lootings have taken place, according to the Venezuelan Observatory for Social Conflict, a rights group. 
In one of the most dramatic incidents, a mob slaughtered cattle grazing in a field in the mountainous western state of Merida. 
Skeptical that authorities can protect them, shopkeepers in the Andean town of Garcia de Hevia in the neighboring state of Tachira have taken matters into their own hands. 
""We're arming ourselves with sticks, knives, machetes, and firearms to defend our assets,"" recounted William Roa, the president of the local shopkeepers' association. 
Roa, who owns a restaurant and liquor store, estimated that more than two-thirds of stores in the small town near the Colombian border were shut. 
""A person spends the night in each store and we communicate using WhatsApp groups, coordinating by block 24 hours a day,"" he said. 
In Ciudad Guayana, a former industrial powerhouse on the Orinoco river in eastern Venezuela, many stores remain closed after a wave of nighttime lootings. 
Garbage fills the streets and few cars circulate, though buses crammed with people crisscross town looking for places to buy food.
Businessmen in Caracas now fear the lootings, so far concentrated in the poorer and more lawless provinces, will spread to the sprawling capital, with its teeming hillside slums. 
The owners of patisserie Arte Paris, in the city's gritty downtown, reinforced the storefront with metal shutters last month. They now only stock ingredients like sugar for a handful of days and have considered hiring a costly nighttime guard. 
""The fear is real,"" said Sebastian Fallone, one of the owners, as men and children begged patrons for food. ""I leave at night without knowing what I will find the next morning."" 
'NO HOPE' 
Government critics say Maduro's refusal to reform the OPEC nation's floundering economy is to blame for the chaotic fight for survival in the country home to the world's largest crude reserves. 
With a presidential election looming this year, Maduro retorts that Venezuela's oil-reliant economy is under attack by U.S.-backed saboteurs seeking to stoke conflict and discredit socialism in Latin America. 
While videos of ransacking have gone viral, Maduro's government has stayed largely mum. The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for information on the scale and impact of the looting.
The unrest has also stoked fears Venezuelan society could unravel as chaos sets in, fuelling mass emigration to nearby South American countries or a full-blown social explosion at home.
""Small-scale protests will be numerous and increasingly violent; any of these protests could contain the spark to serious unrest,"" said consultancy Teneo Intelligence in a note to clients about the year ahead in Venezuela. 
In an effort to curb voter anger over inflation, the government agency tasked with ensuring ""fair prices"" ordered some 200 supermarkets to slash their rates this month, triggering frenetic buying. 
Roadside lootings have also scared truck drivers, disrupting the food distribution chain that is traditionally slower anyway in January because of holidays.
For Mery Cacua, manager of La Gran Parada, a supermarket chain in Tachira's state capital San Cristobal, it has become too much to handle. 
""We're closing in two weeks. There's no hope anymore,"" said Cacua, adding she and her siblings had not yet mustered the strength to break the news to their 87-year-old father, who founded the business 60 years ago. 
The family does not know what to do but is considering starting from scratch in Colombia. 
Venezuelan supermarkets that remain open are often a shadow of what they once were. Many shelves are barren and poor Venezuelans increasingly mass outside stores, imploring entering shoppers to buy them goods. 

""What are they going to loot here? There's nothing. The warehouse is empty,"" said an employee at a big supermarket in Caracas, as a colleague behind him filled empty shelves with water bottles to make them look stocked.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' justice department ordered investigations on Wednesday into possible criminal liability of Rappler, a news site known for challenging the government that has been dubbed a ""fake news outlet"" by the country's controversial president.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on Monday it had revoked Rappler's license for violating the constitution's restrictions on foreign ownership of media, ruling that one of its American investors had the power to influence its operations, despite not owning any shares.
Rappler is permitted to continue operating pending appeal, but the SEC decision prompted outrage among human rights and media groups, which accused President Rodrigo Duterte of punishing Rappler for its reporting. Duterte has denied that and his aides say media freedom is not under attack.
Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre said Rappler had clearly broken an anti-dummy law under existing corporate regulations, so it was necessary for it to be thoroughly investigated by the department for other violations.
""We are going to see if there are other laws violated by anybody in connection with this decision of SEC,"" Aguirre told reporters at a groundbreaking ceremony for a new justice facility on Wednesday.
According to a department order seen by Reuters, Aguirre also granted the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) the authority on Wednesday to investigate and build a case against Rappler ""and if evidence warrants, to file the appropriate cases against those found liable"".
Rappler's acting managing editor, Chay Hofilena, described it as ""a fishing expedition, and pure and simple harassment.""
""It's all the more clear and blatant what the government's agenda is: they're dead-set to get Rappler and kill press freedom.""
DISLIKED BY DUTERTE
Aguirre's order contradicts other government officials, who have insisted the administration is not going after Rappler.
The government says the SEC, an independent body, initiated the investigation into Rappler's ownership, but the SEC has confirmed that it was acting on the request of Solicitor General Jose Calida, a close associate of Duterte.
Duterte on Tuesday furiously rejected suggestions that he had influenced the SEC's decision and took aim at Rappler for what he called fake news and stories ""pregnant with falsity"". 
Aguirre said the president had no hand in the legal action the justice department was taking, insisting it was its job to prosecute when criminal or civil cases came its way.
Rappler chief executive Maria Ressa told news channel ANC earlier on Wednesday that it was ""ludicrous"" to say that one of its two American investors, Omidyar Network, created by eBay founder and entrepreneur Pierre Omidyar, had any control over the news site, or veto powers on company decisions.
Rappler said its filings to the SEC in 2015 made clear that just like several other media outlets, foreigners had invested in some of its Philippine Depositary Receipts (PDR), but did not own any shares, or have a say in operations.
Presidential legal counsel Salvador Panelo said the SEC case against Rappler was not part of a strategy of Duterte to stifle dissent. 

""He doesn't hate criticism. What he hates or reacts against is false information or news,"" Panelo told ANC.

Museveni leveled the criticism in a statement after meeting U.N. officials investigating an ambush of peacekeepers in eastern Congo last month that left 15 dead and 53 wounded.
The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist rebel group that has been operating in the chaotic eastern Congo jungles for years, was widely blamed for the attack.
""The United Nations is responsible for preserving terrorism in the Democratic Republic of Congo,"" Museveni told U.N. investigators, according to the statement from his office. 
It did not elaborate and Museveni's spokeswoman did not respond to calls seeking an explanation. There was no immediate comment from the United Nations. 
The attack was described by U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres as the worst on the world body in recent history. 
Set up in 2010, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo called MONUSCO is the global body's largest but has struggled to neutralize a patchwork of rebel and militia factions in eastern Congo and has previously drawn criticism from Museveni. 
A few days after the ADF attack, Uganda carried out air and artillery strikes on the group's camps. Kampala said it had intelligence the rebels were planning hostile acts against it. 
The East African country, which has a history of meddling in lawless eastern Congo, is eager to prevent the ADF from re-entering Uganda's oil-rich western region as the resulting insecurity could force out investors. 
Uganda is aiming to start pumping crude in its west in 2020.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia's parliament met on Wednesday in a first step toward forming a new government dominated by the question of whether sacked former leader Carles Puigdemont can return as president and continue his push for independence from Spain.
Puigdemont's supporters have suggested the former journalist could rule the wealthy region via video link from self-imposed exile in Brussels, to where he fled in October to avoid arrest for charges including sedition and treason.
The Spanish government had imposed direct rule on the region, whose economy is bigger than that of Portugal, after the previous Catalan administration led by Puigdemont made a unilateral declaration of independence.
However, a regional election in December returned a slim majority to secessionist parties in terms of seats.
In a sign of strength for the parties seeking a split from Spain, Catalan lawmakers on Wednesday elected pro-independence politician Roger Torrent as speaker of the regional parliament.
Torrent was the preferred candidate for speaker of the two main pro-independence parties, Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Republican Left of Catalonia). 
But the secession movement has also been weakened by the fact that five members of parliament, including Puigdemont, are in Brussels while three are in custody for their role in an illegal independence referendum in October.
Late on Tuesday, the two main pro-independence parties said they would back Puigdemont as presidential candidate. A first vote to choose a new leader is likely to take place on Jan. 31. 
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has dismissed the possibility that Puigdemont could rule by Skype as absurd and the Catalan parliament's own legal experts have ruled that any president must be physically present in parliament.
However, the ultimate decision lies in the hands of the Catalan parliamentary committee which will be formed on Wednesday. Rajoy has said he will contest in the courts any move to allow Puigdemont to return to power.
The seats of absent lawmakers were marked with giant yellow ribbons on Wednesday. Even if these lawmakers are unable to vote, the pro-independence parties will still have more weight in parliament than those favoring unity with Spain.
Pro-independence supporters gathered outside the parliament on Wednesday waving red and yellow Catalan flags.
""I know that we are going to have a lot of problems with the Spanish government but we are going to do it,"" said demonstrator Dolors Esplugas. ""On Jan. 31, Carles Puigdemont is going to be appointed."" 
Uncertainty over the region's future has led to thousands of companies, including two of the country's top banks, moving their headquarters from Catalonia to elsewhere in Spain.

The independence drive has also increased tension between Madrid and Barcelona, divided people the region, and caused resentment in much of the rest of Spain.

The treaty will ""complement"" but not replace the 2003 Le Touquet border agreement, which has drawn criticism in France after the town of Calais became a hub for migrants and refugees on their way to Britain, just 33 km (20 miles) across the English Channel.
France wants Britain to provide more money and resources to tackle the migrant flows and has suggested that the Le Touquet accord may have to be ended if a compromise or a new set of arrangements can't be reached.
Under Le Touquet, Britain has its border in France and France runs border checks in Britain, a deal that French officials say favors the United Kingdom.
Both parties can withdraw from the treaty, which would mean a return to hard national borders. That move that would symbolically cut Britain off from the continent just as it is implementing Brexit.
A French official said issues of unaccompanied children, asylum requests, border police cooperation and possible British support to the economic development of the Calais region will be part of the new agreement, which is still being discussed.
""We'll boost British financial support to the securitization of transport infrastructure, border police and security and we'll raise this question of economic development,"" the presidential adviser said.

Britain scrambled two Royal Air Force Typhoon jets on Monday to intercept Russian planes near the United Kingdom's airspace, a defense ministry spokesman said, the latest incident where British forces had been deployed because of concern over a Russian military incursion. 
When asked for comment on the maneuvers, a spokesman for the Russian embassy in London said such statements from the British defense ministry were part of a public relations exercise aimed at undermining Russia's image.
""We consider these and similar statements as a PR exercise, meant to demonstrate some assumed 'aggressiveness' from Russia, as well as panache of certain British politicians,"" the embassy said in a statement in English.
""No incursion into UK airspace has ever taken place, and no Russian plane has been forced to land or even change its course,"" it said. ""Russian planes carry out the routine flights in international airspace."" 
Relations between Russia and Britain are strained. May last year accused Moscow of military aggression and in December, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said there was abundant evidence of Russia meddling in foreign elections.
The Kremlin, which under Vladimir Putin has clawed back some of the global influence lost when the Soviet Union collapsed, has denied meddling in elections in the West. It says anti-Russian hysteria is sweeping through the United States and Europe.
""We will take the necessary actions to counter Russian activity,"" May said in a speech at the Guildhall in London’s financial district on Nov. 13.
The Russian embassy said May was speaking about vigilance without dealing with the real threats, which it didn't specify.
""This imitation game, in the pattern of PM Theresa May’s speech ... is about showing off vigilance rather than dealing with real threats,"" the embassy spokesman said.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani authorities on Wednesday arrested a suspect in the rape and murder of a 7-year-old girl that ignited nationwide protests and outrage over allegations of government inaction, two police officials said.
Police found Zainab Ansari's body in a garbage dumpster in Kasur district near the eastern city of Lahore last week, four days after she was reported missing.
Residents of the area have said the murder was the 12th such incident in a year, and has fueled fears a serial rapist killer might be on the loose.
Two people were killed in Kasur last week when police fired at hundreds of angry protesters, who said negligence on the part of the authorities was behind the repeated killings. 
The two police officers told Reuters the authorities had arrested a man who was being treated as a prime suspect, after police had questioned dozens of people in the case. 
""Evidence we're getting leads us to believe that he is the man,"" said one officer, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to disclose investigation details. 
Shahbaz Sharif, the chief minister of Punjab province, where Kasur is located, visited the town on Wednesday and held a meeting with officials on the investigation.
Sharif did not confirm the arrest in his remarks to media after the meeting, but said the police and other law enforcement agencies were close to solving the case, promising a breakthrough within ""days or hours"". 

Sharif has offered a reward of 10 million Pakistani rupees ($90,000) for anyone who provides information about the killer.

Cambodian politics has been in turmoil since the dissolution of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) last year, following the arrest of its leader, Kem Sokha, on treason charges he says were politically motivated.
Sam Rainsy, a former CNRP leader now living in exile in France, called for a postponement of the July election, at which Prime Minister Hun Sen is now expected to easily extend his 33 years in power.
The vote should only be held once it can ""meet minimum international standards"", Sam Rainsy wrote in a social media tweet. 
""This would avoid both violence and Cambodia becoming a pariah state,"" he added.
Western countries have condemned the dissolution of the opposition party and said the election cannot be credible, but there has been little open public reaction to the decision, with many CNRP supporters saying they are afraid to protest.
Government spokesman Phay Siphan accused Sam Rainsy of trying to create fear.
""This is a threat to the whole of Cambodia against holding the election,"" he told Reuters. ""There is no necessity to delay the election. Elections in Cambodia have never been postponed.""
Sam Rainsy, a veteran foe of Hun Sen, recently announced the formation of a new opposition group - the Cambodia National Rescue Movement (CNRM), but some Cambodia-based members of the now banned opposition party have criticized the decision.

Sam Rainsy has lived in France since 2015 to avoid a series of convictions he says were politically motivated.

SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria's main opposition party filed a motion of no-confidence in Prime Minister Boyko Borissov's government on Wednesday over lack of progress in fighting corruption but the attempt is likely to fail.
The center-right government is backed by a small populist party and if the bloc abstains in next week's vote the Socialist Party (BSP) motion will fall 41 votes short of the number it needs to topple the coalition in the 240-seat parliament.
Borissov's GERB party and junior coalition partner, the nationalist formation United Patriots, have 133 votes along with the populist Will party.
""The no-confidence vote is not sabotage but a response to 83 percent of Bulgarian citizens who think this is their number one problem,"" Socialist party leader Kornelia Ninova said.
""Combating corruption is a pro-European policy, not an anti-European one. It is better to be alone against corruption than a be part of the status quo that defends corruption,"" Ninova said.
The European Commission has repeatedly rebuked the country for failing to prosecute and sentence corrupt officials.
Bulgaria, the European Union's poorest country, assumed the six-month, rotating presidency of the bloc two weeks ago for the first time since it joined the EU in 2007.
Last week demonstrations, some with an anti-corruption theme, blocked the capital Sofia as the country hosted ceremonies for the start of its EU presidency.[nL8N1P44SF]
""While the vote has little chance of succeeding, public protests are likely in the coming weeks,"" Otilia Dhand of Teneo Intelligence wrote in an analyst note.
""Borissov's efforts to maintain domestic political calm may strain coalition relations, increasing medium-term risks for government stability,"" Dhand said.
Corruption has reduced foreign investment since communism collapsed in Bulgaria in 1989 and the EU has kept Sofia as well as neighboring Romania outside its Schengen zone of passport-free travel citing failings over its fight against graft.
On Friday, Bulgaria's parliament overturned a presidential veto on anti-graft legislation, clearing the way for the creation of a special unit to investigate individuals occupying high public office as well as assets and conflicts of interest.

The standoff between President Ashraf Ghani and Balkh Governor Atta Mohammad Noor has threatened to destabilize the fragile Western-backed administration in Kabul and raised fears the government could try to use force to break the stalemate.
Pence spoke to Ghani about Washington's new South Asia strategy and afterwards posted a message on Twitter saying he had emphasized support for the Afghan government ""to engage (with) Balkh Governor Atta and conduct peace transition of leadership"",
Noor is one of the most prominent of a number of powerful regional leaders who have been a thorn in the side of Ghani, a former World Bank official named president after a disputed election in 2014.
The confrontation, amid increasing political maneuvering ahead of presidential elections next year, has been colored by the ethnic rivalries that have become increasingly prominent in Afghan politics.
Noor is a leader of Jamiat-i Islami, a party mainly supported by Persian-speaking ethnic Tajiks in the north who have become increasingly resentful of Ghani, a Pashtun, whom they accuse of favoring his own ethnic group, which is mainly based in the south and east.
Negotiations between the president's office and officials from Jamiat have been going on for weeks, so far without result and Western diplomats in Kabul are concerned the standoff could degenerate into violence.
As well as damaging the government, the uncertainty has threatened to undermine the new U.S. strategy of stepping up pressure on the Taliban through air strikes and increased support to Afghan security forces to try to force the insurgents to the negotiating table. 
On Monday, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson, said that the United States and the international community wanted to see a peaceful solution.
""We respect and support all Afghans and we hope, of course, internal political resolutions will occur so that we can move forward,"" he told reporters at the margins of a change of command ceremony in the southern province of Helmand.

""If this is sorted out, this is a big win because it demonstrates to all Afghans that differences can be resolved non-violently through a political process.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The phones at U.S. sexual assault hotlines have been ringing in record numbers as the #MeToo social movement spurs victims to reach out for help, sending organizations scrambling to keep up.
Calls spiked when the movement began in October, with people waiting up to three hours to talk to someone at the country's largest one, the National Sexual Assault Hotline. 
The number of calls to the hotline operated by the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) surged 25 percent in November from a year earlier, and another 30 percent in December, according to RAINN. Its 209,480 total calls in 2017 were the most for any year since its founding in 1993.
Last fall, actress Alyssa Milano of the television show ""Charmed"" asked women who had been sexually assaulted or harassed to post ""Me Too"" in response to allegations made against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. 
Weinstein, accused of sexual abuse by dozens of women, has denied having nonconsensual sexual contact with anyone. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm the accusations.
At the national hotline's call center, the lights that workers flip on to indicate they are on the phone never seemed to turn off, said Celia Gamboa, a manager at the national hotline. The chat app most callers prefer was flooded with messages, she said. The #MeToo movement almost always came up.
""It wasn't just a one-time thing,"" Gamboa said. ""We're just going to continue to see that type of flow into the future.""
RAINN added 40 employees to its staff of 200 and stepped up volunteer recruiting, said CEO Scott Berkowitz. That has helped chip away at the wait times, he said.
Elsewhere, Network for Victim Recovery of D.C. saw a spike in calls about sexual harassment. Executive Director Bridgette Stumpf said that unfortunately, the center can often only recommend private attorneys for people whose harassment did not include violence, adding such help may be too expensive for many victims.
The DC Rape Crisis Center now sees an average of 70 people a week seeking legal, physical or psychological help, up from 30 to 40 before #MeToo, said Executive Director Indira Henard. It also saw a bump in donations last fall following the #MeToo postings. 

""It is for the record books,"" Henard said. ""I don't believe there has ever been a time in our history when we talked about sexual violence and its impact this way.""

Oskar Groening, known as the ""bookkeeper of Auschwitz"", was sentenced to four years in prison in 2015 for being an accessory to murder at Auschwitz. But he has not yet started his sentence due to a dispute about his health.
No one at the prosecutor's office in Lueneburg, where Groening's trial took place in 2015, was immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters.
In December Germany's constitutional court ruled Groening must go to jail, rejecting arguments from his lawyers that imprisonment at his advanced age would violate his right to life.
Groening's court battle was seen as one of the last major trials related to the Holocaust, during which some 6 million Jews were murdered by Adolf Hitler's regime.
Prosecutors said Groening - who did not kill anyone himself while working at Auschwitz - had helped support the regime responsible for mass murder by sorting bank notes seized from trainloads of arriving Jews.

Groening admitted he was morally guilty for the work he carried out at Auschwitz, which included sending bank notes he found in Jews' luggage to SS offices in Berlin, where they helped to fund the Nazi war effort.

The government will remain in office in a caretaker capacity after the compulsory step, pending negotiations on forming an alternative administration that could take weeks or months as parties shun Babis while he battles allegations he abused an EU subsidy program a decade ago as a businessman. 
""The government approved its resignation and I will ask for an appointment with the president so that I can deliver the resignation personally,"" Babis said.
President Milos Zeman has said he will give Babis another go at forming a government. 
The president's spokesman said Zeman would accept the resignation by the end of the working week.
Police allege Babis, the country's second-richest person, hid ownership of one of his companies a decade ago to win a 2 million euro subsidy, mostly from European Union funds, meant for small businesses. He denies wrongdoing.
He was charged in the case but regained immunity from prosecution when he won a lower house seat in an October general election in which his ANO party was the winner by a wide margin but failed to reach a majority.
Parliament will decide whether to lift Babis' immunity on Friday.
The other eight parties in parliament have so far rejected any form of cooperation with ANO, though its decisive victory means it is almost certain to be in any viable government, with or without Babis at the helm.
Several parties have signaled they might discuss governing with ANO, especially if Babis was not prime minister, a condition he has so far refused to meet.
Government talks could also drag on because of the possible departure of Zeman as president, whose reelection bid is facing a formidable challenger in academic Jiri Drahos.

Pictures of the office of the group, Memorial, in Nazran, a town in the Russian region of Ingushetia which borders Chechnya, showed the blackened interior of an office strewn with fire-damaged debris.
Memorial is under pressure in the Muslim-majority North Caucasus region after police in Chechnya detained the head of its office there this month and accused him of possessing a large quantity of cannabis, a crime punishable by up to 10 years in jail.
Concerns about the case of the detained activist, Oyub Titiev, who has written to President Vladimir Putin saying that he was framed and that the police planted the drugs in his car, prompted the United States and Europe to call for his release.
Memorial has angered authorities in Chechnya by reporting disappearances, torture and punitive house burnings there. Titiev's predecessor, Natalia Estemirova, was kidnapped and shot dead in 2009. Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Chechnya, has said allegations that Chechen authorities use illegal violence are false and invented to secure foreign grants.
Memorial said it had captured some of the overnight arson attack on CCTV which showed two masked men breaking into its office with petrol cans and called on the authorities in Ingushetia to investigate the attack as an act of terrorism.
""The work of Memorial's representative office in Ingushetia is exclusively dedicated to human rights problems on the territory of Ingushetia and in no way linked to Chechnya,"" Memorial said in a statement.
""Nonetheless, it's obvious to us that there is a link between the arson attack with those forces who are trying to destroy the work of Memorial in Chechnya and squeeze Memorial out of the entire North Caucasus region.""

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>","As Trump heads to Davos, survey points to rising risk of war","By Noah Barkin 
BERLIN (Reuters) - The risk of political and economic confrontations between major powers, including outright military conflicts, has risen sharply, according to a survey released by the World Economic Forum (WEF) days before its annual gathering in Davos.
The Global Risks Report highlighted several top risks for 2018, including environmental threats from extreme weather and temperatures, economic inequalities and cyber attacks.
But most remarkable was the surge in geopolitical concerns after a year of escalating rhetoric between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that has arguably brought the world closer to a nuclear conflict than it has been in decades.
Trump is due to give a speech on the closing day of the WEF, an annual event in the Swiss Alps which runs from Jan. 23-26 and will attract 70 heads of state and government, as well as celebrities, CEOs and top bankers.
The survey of nearly 1,000 experts from government, business, academia and non-governmental organizations showed 93 percent expect a worsening of political or economic confrontations between major powers in 2018, including 40 percent who believe those risks have increased significantly.
Some 79 percent see a heightened risk of state-on-state military conflict. In addition to the threat of a conflict on the Korean peninsula, the report pointed to the risk of new military confrontations in the Middle East.
It cited a rise in ""charismatic strongman politics"" across the world and said political, economic and environmental risks were being exacerbated by a decline in support for rules-based multilateralism.
WRONG DIRECTION
The report pointed to Trump's decisions to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and the TPP trade agreement and his threat to pull out of a deal between Western powers and Iran designed to curb its nuclear program.
""The risks we are trying to grapple with here require multilateral solutions but we are moving in the other direction,"" said John Drzik, president of global risk and digital at the consultancy Marsh, which helped compile the report.
While geopolitical worries rose sharply, the environment topped the list of concerns, with extreme weather events seen as the single most prominent risk in 2018 after a year of unusually frequent Atlantic storms, including Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico.
With global growth recovering, concerns about the economy were down sharply. Still, the report described income inequality as a ""corrosive problem"" in many countries and warned against complacency over the economic environment given high debt levels, low savings rates and inadequate pension provisions.
""A widening economic recovery presents us with an opportunity that we cannot afford to squander, to tackle the fractures that we have allowed to weaken the world's institutions, societies and environment,"" said Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF.

""We must take seriously the risk of a global systems breakdown.""

TAIPEI (Reuters) - A Chinese carrier group has sailed through the narrow Taiwan Strait that separates the self-ruled island from its giant neighbor but no unusual activity was detected, Taiwan said on Wednesday, amid heightened tension with Beijing.
Beijing has taken an increasingly hostile stance toward Taiwan since the election two years ago of President Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. 
China suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence, though she has said she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to ensuring peace.
In recent months, China has stepped up military drills around Taiwan, alarming Taipei. China says the exercises are routine, but that it will not tolerate any attempt by the island to declare independence.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said a group of Chinese ships led by the Liaoning aircraft carrier entered the southwestern part of the Taiwan Strait in the early hours of Tuesday, though it stayed on the Chinese side of the waterway.
As of midday on Wednesday the carrier group had left Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone heading in a northerly direction, the ministry said, adding it had monitored the group's movements throughout.
""While the group was passing through the Taiwan Strait there were no abnormal activities, and people can rest easy,"" it added.
China's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the Soviet-era Liaoning, China's first aircraft carrier, has passed through the Taiwan Strait before on its way to and from exercises in the South China Sea.
While heavily traveled by commercial shipping and flights, the Taiwan Strait is also a sensitive military zone.
This month, Taiwan complained about China launching a new air route for civilian flights that runs close to two groups of Taiwan-controlled islands off the Chinese coast in the strait, saying it threatened regional security and aviation safety.
China does not need Taiwan's permission to open new air routes, a government spokesman said on Wednesday, denying there was a safety risk.
Taiwan said on Friday the new flight path was so close to the middle line of the Taiwan Strait that it would affect Taiwan air force exercises and other flight operations.
""The planes can come very close to each other,"" an official added, referring to other connecting routes that China has opened and where Taiwan civilian flights already operate.
""It becomes a very dangerous situation if we do not consult with each other."" 

China, which considers Taiwan a wayward province, snapped official communication with its government after Tsai took office.

Ankara has warned in recent days of an imminent military operation in Afrin, one of three autonomous cantons under the control of Kurdish forces and their allies.
""Afrin will not be alone,"" the PYD said in a statement, vowing that all of northern and eastern Syria would stand with it.
Since the conflict began in 2011, the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and its allies have set up autonomous cantons in the north of the country. Their sphere of influence expanded after they joined forces with the United States to fight Islamic State - although Washington opposes their autonomy plans.
""We call on the international community...to take responsibility toward more than a million people living in Afrin,"" the PYD said.
The party - the YPG's political affiliate - urged the United Nations to take immediate action to turn Kurdish-led parts of northern and eastern Syria into a safe zone.
""The Turkish regime...has become a threat to any solution to the Syrian crisis,"" it added.
The YPG and Turkish forces inside Syria have accused each other of shelling around the Afrin region in recent days.
Turkey views the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) which has fought an insurgency in southeast Turkey since 1984.
The U.S.-led coalition said this week that it is building a new 30,000-strong border force with its Syrian militia allies in the north, a plan that has infuriated NATO ally Ankara.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan pledged to crush the new force before it came into existence.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnamese executives on trial for losses at a scandal-hit state oil firm used their final statement in court on Wednesday to apologize to the ruling Communist Party, media said, as Vietnam's biggest corruption trial for years draws to a close.
The trial of 22 former PetroVietam employees, which ends on Monday, is part of a crackdown on fraud and mismanagement that government critics say is politically motivated and targeting those close to former prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung.
The crackdown intensified last year after Dung lost a power struggle in 2016 against Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong.
The defendants included Dinh La Thang, a former politburo official and chairman of PetroVietnam, and Trinh Xuan Thanh, the former chairman of PetroVietnam Construction whom Germany accuses Vietnam of kidnapping from a Berlin park in a scene reminiscent of Cold War disappearances.
Dinh La Thang, the most senior Vietnamese politician to be put on trial in decades, said he would like to ""bow and say sorry"" to the Communist Party, to which he remained ""absolutely loyal"", according to the VNExpress newspaper.
Thang, who faces 14 to 15 years in jail over allegations of deliberate misconduct, quoted an earlier comment from General Secretary Trong, who said officials accused of wrongdoings should be encouraged to correct their own mistakes instead of being ""beaten to death"", VNExpress reported.
""I trust the party leadership and the fair and objective judgment of the court,"" Thang said.
Foreign media were not permitted to attend the trial.
In his final statement, Trinh Xuan Thanh also asked the People's Court of Hanoi to send his apology to General Secretary Trong. Thanh faces a life sentence over allegations of misconduct and embezzlement.
""The lawyers have said clearly that the evidence was fuzzy and conflicting,"" the Phap Luat newspaper quoted Thanh as saying in reference to the charges.
Germany says Thanh was seeking asylum there but was forcibly repatriated by Vietnam last August. Germany expelled two diplomats over the incident, but Vietnam says police arrested Thanh after he turned himself in voluntarily.
In his final statement, Thanh thanked prison officials for helping him gain the weight he lost at the start of his detention.

In a separate case linked to the crackdown on fraud and mismanagement, a fugitive Vietnamese tycoon Phan Van Anh Vu, 42, was arrested in Hanoi this month after being deported from Singapore. Vu, who was also trying to get to Germany, told his lawyers he worked for Vietnamese intelligence.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Twenty nations agreed on Tuesday to consider tougher sanctions to press North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned Pyongyang it could trigger a military response if it did not choose negotiations.
A U.S.-hosted meeting of countries that backed South Korea during the 1950-53 Korea War also vowed to support renewed dialogue between the two Koreas ""in hopes that it leads to sustained easing of tensions"" and agreed that a diplomatic solution to the crisis was both essential and possible.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has refused to give up development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States in spite of increasingly severe U.N. sanctions, raising fears of a new war on the Korean peninsula.
The United States and Canada co-hosted the day-long meeting in Vancouver to discuss ways to increase pressure on Kim.
U.S. officials have reported a debate within the Trump administration over whether to give more active consideration to military options, such as a pre-emptive strike on a North Korean nuclear or missile site.
Tillerson brushed off a question about such a ""bloody nose"" strike, telling a closing news conference: ""I’m a not going to comment on issues that have yet to be decided among the National Security Council or the president.""
However, he said the threat posed by North Korea was growing.
""We all need to be very sober and clear-eyed about the current situation ... We have to recognize that the threat is growing and if North Korea does not chose the pathway of engagement, discussion, negotiation, then they themselves will trigger an option,"" Tillerson said.
""Our approach is, in terms of having North Korea chose the correct step, is to present them with what is the best option – talks are the best option; that when they look at the military situation, that's not a good outcome for them.""
""It is time to talk, but they have to take the step to say they want to talk.""
The Vancouver meeting pledged to ensure that U.N. sanctions already in place were fully implemented and the participants said in a joint statement they agreed ""to consider and take steps to impose unilateral sanctions and further diplomatic actions that go beyond those required by U.N. Security Council resolutions."" They gave no details.
Tillerson said all countries needed to work together to improve interdiction of ships attempting to skirt sanctions and said there must be ""new consequences"" for North Korea ""whenever new aggression occurs.""
He said the meeting had agreed that China and Russia, which did not attend the Vancouver talks and sharply criticized them, must fully implement U.N. sanctions.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Canada and the United States were demonstrating a “Cold War mentality"" that would divide the international community and damage chances of an appropriate settlement on the peninsula.
“Only through dialogue, equally addressing the reasonable concerns of all parties, can a way to an effective and peaceful resolution be found,” Lu added.
U.S. officials say discussion of a military strike option has lost some momentum since North and South Korea held formal talks for the first time in two years this month and Pyongyang said it would send athletes to the Winter Olympics that South Korea will host next month.
'NOT TIME FOR REWARD'
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said in Vancouver that the world should not be naive about North Korea's ""charm offensive"" in engaging in talks with the South.
""It is not the time to ease pressure, or to reward North Korea,"" he said. ""The fact that North Korea is engaging in dialogue could be interpreted as proof that the sanctions are working.""
South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said she hoped the dialogue would continue well beyond the Olympics, but stressed that existing sanctions must be applied more rigorously.
Tillerson said North Korea must not be allowed ""to drive a wedge"" through allied resolve or solidarity and reiterated Washington's rejection of a Chinese-Russian proposal for the United States and South Korea to freeze military exercises in return for a freeze in North Korea's weapons programs.
A senior State Department official said U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis briefed the Vancouver participants over dinner on Monday and stressed the U.S. preference for a diplomatic solution, while keeping a military option on the table.
""It was a chance to raise people's confidence that we have thought through this, that we definitely prefer a diplomatic solution,"" the official said.
Russia and China have been accused of not fully implementing the U.N. sanctions, something they deny.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking on Tuesday in the West African state of Sao Tome, said everyone should cherish the present easing of tension on the Korean peninsula.
But history shows that each time tensions ease, there could be interference or backsliding, Wang added.
""Now is the time to test each side's sincerity,"" he said. ""The international community must keep its eyes wide open, and see who is really the promoter of a peaceful resolution to the peninsula nuclear issue and who will become the saboteur who causes a return to tensions.""

A U.S. official said Susan Thornton, the State Department's senior diplomat for East Asia, would travel to Beijing from Vancouver to brief China on the outcome. He said he expected Tillerson to provide readouts to his Russian and Chinese counterparts.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A mostly Muslim county in western China has banned children from attending religious events over a winter break, an education bureau said in a notice posted online, as authorities step up control of religious education.
School students in Linxia county in Gansu province, home to many members of the Muslim Hui ethnic minority, are prohibited from entering religious buildings over their break, a district education bureau said, according to the notification.
Students must also not read scriptures in classes or in religious buildings, the bureau said, adding that all students and teachers should heed the notice and work to strengthen political ideology and propaganda.
Reuters was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the notice. 
A man who answered the telephone at the Linxia education bureau hung up when Reuters asked about the notice. A woman at the district education bureau declined to comment on the document's authenticity.
Xi Wuyi, a Marxist scholar at the state-backed Chinese Academy of Social Scientists and an outspoken critic of rising Islamic influence in China, shared the picture and welcomed the apparent move by the authorities.
With the notice, the county was taking concrete action to keep religion and education separate and sticking strictly to education law, she said on the Weibo social media platform.
New regulations on religious affairs released in October last year, and due to take effect in February, aim to increase oversight of religious education, and provide for greater regulation of religious activities.
Last summer, a Sunday School ban was introduced in the southeastern city of Wenzhou, sometimes known as ""China's Jerusalem"" due to its large Christian population, but Christian parents found ways to teach their children about their religion regardless. 
Chinese law officially grants religious freedom for all but regulations on education and protection of minors also say religion cannot be used to hinder state education or to ""coerce"" children to believe.
Authorities in troubled parts of China, such as the far western region of Xinjiang, home to the Turkic-speaking Uighur Muslim minority, ban children from attending religious events.
But religious communities elsewhere rarely face blanket restrictions.
Fear of Muslims influence has grown in China in recent years, sparked in part by violence in Xinjiang.
The Chinese-speaking Hui, who are culturally more similar to the Han Chinese majority than to Uighurs, have also come under scrutiny from some intellectuals who fear creeping Islamic influence on society.

Satellite imaging showed a slick of 69 square km (26.6 square miles) and a second 40 square km (15.4 square miles) slick, which is less thick and not as concentrated, the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) said in a statement.
The large tanker Sanchi (IMO:9356608) sank in the worst oil ship disaster in decades on Sunday, raising worries about damage to the marine ecosystem. The bodies of two sailors were recovered from the ship while a third body was pulled from the sea near the vessel. The remaining 29 crew of the ship are presumed dead. 
In a statement on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport said the salvage team had located the wreck, which was at a depth of 115 meters (377 feet) under sea level, and were preparing to send underwater robots to explore it.
The SOA said vessels have taken 31 water samples in the area around the wreck containing black grease with heavy oil smells, and a concentration of petroleum that exceeds some seawater quality standard limits.
Clean-up teams continue to monitor the wreck area to assess the distribution and drift of the oil spill and the ecological impact.
The Sanchi had been adrift and ablaze after crashing into the freighter CF Crystal (IMO:9497050) on Jan. 6. Strong winds pushed it away from the Chinese coast, where the incident happened, and into Japan's exclusive economic zone.
The ship, which was carrying 136,000 tonnes or almost 1 million barrels of condensate - an ultra-light, highly flammable crude oil - sank after several explosions weakened the hull.
On Tuesday, Japan's environment ministry said it does not see much chance that the spill will reach its shores.

The demonstrators gathered late on Tuesday in Mrauk U township in the northern part of Rakhine to mark the end of the Arakan kingdom, the secretary of the Rakhine state government, Tin Maung Swe, told Reuters.
The violent demonstration underscores the challenges facing Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a country where dozens of ethnic groups have been clamoring for autonomy since independence from Britain in 1947.
Some 4,000 people surrounded a government building after the annual ceremony marking the demise of the Arakan kingdom over 200 years ago, Tin Maung Swe said. Organizers did not seek approval from local authorities for the gathering, he said. 
""The police used rubber bullets initially but the crowd didn't leave. Finally the security members had to shoot. The conflict happened when some people tried to seize guns from the police,"" he said. 
Tun Ther Sein, regional MP from Mrauk U, said some of the critically injured protesters were taken to the state capital of Sittwe, a three-hour drive south of the ancient town studded with Buddhist temples. 
The Rakhine, also known as Arakanese, are one of the 135 officially recognized ethnic groups in Myanmar. Their identity is closely connected to the once powerful Arakanese kingdom along the Bay of Bengal, which was conquered by the Burmese kingdom in 1784. The kingdom was once an important stop on the old silk trade route.
Tensions in Rakhine have risen since a sweeping Myanmar army operation in August inflamed communal tension and triggered an exodus of over 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's military court on Wednesday dropped the prosecution of an 85-year-old academic who had been accused of royal insult for questioning the truth of a 17th century elephant-back battle, he and his lawyer said.
Under Thailand's strict lese majeste law against defaming, insulting or threatening the monarchy, Sualak Sivaraksa could have been jailed for up to 15 years if found guilty over the accusation, which related to a university seminar in 2014.
He had questioned whether a battle had really taken place in which Thai national hero King Naresuan the Great is said to have killed a Burmese prince. King Naresuan ruled from 1590 to 1650.
Thailand's junta has made increasing use of the lese majeste law since seizing power in 2014 and the dismissal of the case before prosecution was a rarity.
Sulak gave thanks to King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who succeeded his revered late father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in 2016.
""I think this case has stopped because of the grace of the king. I asked many people for help and no one dared. So I petitioned the king,"" Sulak told reporters at the court.
His lawyer, Puangtip Boonsanong, said the court had cited lack of evidence as the reason for dropping the case.
Neither the court nor the police made any comment.
At least 94 people have been prosecuted for lese majeste and as many as 43 have been sentenced since the 2014 coup. Most of the others prosecuted are still facing trial.
The lese majeste law does not apply to past or deceased kings but is sometime loosely interpreted and used to defend the royal establishment. 
In 2013, the Supreme Court sentenced a man to two years in prison over a comment he made in 2005 about King Mongkut, who reigned from 1851 to 1868, because it could have affected the then king.
King Naresuan's elephant battle is highly celebrated in Thai official history and is commemorated each year by the military as the Royal Thai Armed Forces Day.

Despite being a self-proclaimed royalist, Sulak was arrested and charged with royal defamation against King Bhumibol in 1984 for criticizing the monarchy. The case was later withdrawn following international pressure.

""So far 33 skulls have been found. All discovered in the same area,"" said a government official in the Pacific state of Nayarit, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
It was not yet clear who the skulls belonged to or why they were buried in three shallow graves, the official said.
Investigations have been underway at the site in southern Nayarit since Saturday and further discoveries of human remains are possible, he said.
Nayarit has been one of the states hit hardest by an increase in gang-related killings, which helped push murders to a record high in Mexico in 2017.
Much of the killing stems from a power struggle between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, a gang based in neighboring Jalisco state, and their rivals in the Sinaloa Cartel of captured kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.
U.S. authorities arrested Nayarit's attorney general in San Diego last year on drug trafficking charges.

The agency, citing the recently formed Presidency of State Security, identified the man as Abdullah bin Mirza Ali al-Qallaf and said he was killed during a security operation on Monday night at a farm between the restive Shi'ite Muslim communities of Awamiya and Qudaih.
""He was in a silver Hyundai Sonata with fake license plates and when security forces tried to stop him, he refused to comply and opened fire toward security men who responded in kind to neutralize his danger, and as result he was killed,"" SPA said.
It said no security forces personnel were hurt.
Security forces found a Kalashnikov rifle, a pistol, ammunition, a military uniform and masks inside the car, the agency said.
Mirat al-Jazeera, an online newspaper that often reflects Shi'ite views, said Qallaf's name had not appeared on lists of wanted people issued by Saudi authorities since protests began in eastern Saudi Arabia, where many members of the Shi'ite minority live.
Awamiya has long been a flashpoint between the Sunni-led government and Shi'ites complaining of discrimination, a charge Saudi Arabia denies. Tension has increased since Nimr al-Nimr, a prominent Shi'ite cleric convicted of inciting violence, was executed in 2016.
Authorities last year tore down the old town of Awamiya known as al-Musawara, which dates back more than 200 years, saying the narrow streets had become a hideout for militants believed to be behind attacks on security forces in the oil-producing region.
In its place, authorities said they plan to build a modern community with shops and offices.

NHK issued an erroneous alarm on its website on Tuesday evening, saying North Korea appeared to have launched a missile and urging people to take shelter. A similar gaffe caused panic in the U.S. island state of Hawaii at the weekend.
Japan's public broadcaster put out another message on its website within five minutes correcting itself and said no government warning, known as a ""J-alert"", had been issued.
""The J-alert system is information of extreme importance in maintaining the security and safety of the people, so we've asked that they ensure this does not happen again,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference.
There have been no reports of panic or other disruptions following the NHK report.
NHK said the false alert was sent by mistake when it was trying to issue another news flash. 
The broadcaster declined to say what the other news flash was about, but some domestic news outlets issued bulletins at around the same time about the latest recipients of a Japanese literary award.
NHK is looking into measures to prevent a recurrence but could not comment on specific details because the plan had not been firmed up yet, an NHK spokeswoman said.

The false alert was also sent to mobile phone users of NHK's online news distribution service. It was not clear how many of its 300,000 users have a function to let news alerts pop up on the cellphone screen when activated, NHK said.

1342,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 12:04AM ET</span>",Hong Kong democracy leader Joshua Wong jailed a second time for 2014 protest,"By Venus Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, 21, was sentenced to a second jail term of three months on Wednesday for what a judge described as his ""leading"" role during some of the 2014 pro-democracy ""Umbrella Movement"" street demonstrations.
Wong and 19 other demonstrators were found guilty of criminal contempt of court because they refused to obey a court injunction order to leave a protest zone in late November 2014.
The protest was part of the biggest populist uprising for decades in Hong Kong and posed a spirited challenge to Beijing's Communist Party leaders in demanding full democracy.
For more than two months, tens of thousands of mostly student and young demonstrators camped out in tents on major highways, defying government, police and Chinese demands to leave. Umbrellas became a symbol of defiance after protesters used them as shields against police pepper spray and batons.
High Court Judge Andrew Chan said that even though Wong only stayed in the protest area for 90 minutes on the day in question, ""his involvement in obstructing the clearance operation was deep and extensive. He played a leading role on that day"".
""In view of his overall involvement, I am of the view that the only appropriate punishment ... will be one of immediate imprisonment,"" said Chan.
Another activist, Raphael Wong, was also jailed, while the remaining protesters, including former student leader Lester Shum, received suspended sentences. 
""Thank you your honor for your ruling. Our determination to fight for genuine universal suffrage will not waver,"" stated Raphael Wong in the courtroom before being taken away.
Lawyers for both the Wongs said they would appeal, but they were denied an immediate request for bail. 
Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 amid promises that the Asian financial hub would enjoy a high degree of autonomy under a so-called 'one country, two systems' arrangement.
A perceived tightening of control by Beijing's Communist Party leaders in recent years, however, has fueled a groundswell of pro-democracy activism aimed at defending the city's constitutionally enshrined freedoms. 
While a spirited young generation has given Hong Kong's flagging push for democracy fresh impetus, some 100 key activists have, or could be, jailed in upcoming trials, in what critics say is an attempt to counter the movement's momentum. 
Upon learning about the sentence from his lawyers shortly before the court hearing started, Joshua Wong looked up from behind the dock, squeezed his eyes shut and sighed. Wong chose not to fight the charge in the spirit of civil disobedience. 

Wong had begun serving a six-months imprisonment sentence last August for a separate unlawful assembly charge, but he was granted bail by Hong Kong's highest court, which heard the appeal against the sentence on Tuesday. It would decide upon the case on a later date.

Presidential spokesman Heinz Hiemann said Acisclo Valladares would take on the economy portfolio from Victor Asturias, Alcides Obregon would replace Enio Galicia at social development and Alonzo Vargas would step in for Sydney Samuels in environment.
Hiemann gave few details on the reasons for the changes but said Galicia was being replaced for poor implementation of the budget, Samuels because he wanted to step down and that Valladares had the ""necessary experience"" for the job.
Morales has been under pressure in Guatemala since a U.N.-backed anti-corruption body attempted to impeach him for engaging in alleged campaign finance irregularities in 2015. Morales has denied the accusations.

Filing charges against the officers marks the Navy's latest effort to address the problems that led to collisions involving its warships in Asia, in which 17 sailors were killed.
The Navy has already dismissed several senior officers, including the commander of the Seventh Fleet, as a result of the collisions.
Evidence supporting the charges against the commanders and several lower-ranking officers who served on the ships will be reviewed soon in investigative hearings, according to the Navy's statement.
""The announcement of an Article 32 hearing and referral to a court-martial is not intended to and does not reflect a determination of guilt or innocence related to any offenses,"" the statement added.
The commanding officer of the USS John S. McCain guided missile destroyer, which collided with a merchant ship near Singapore in August, faces charges of dereliction of duty, hazarding a vessel and negligent homicide, the statement said.
The commanding officer and three other officers on the USS Fitzgerald guided missile destroyer, which collided with a Philippine container ship in June, face charges including dereliction of duty, hazarding a vessel and negligent homicide, the Navy said.
Results from Navy investigations released in November found that both accidents were the result of human error by sailors aboard the ships, but determined that no single person could be blamed for the accidents.

Beyond the courts-martial, the Navy is conducting additional administrative actions for members of both crews, including non-judicial punishment for four crewmembers of each vessel, according to the Navy statement on Tuesday.

Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration said that as of September 2019, it would eliminate the temporary protected status, or TPS, that allows some 200,000 Salvadorans to live in the United States without fear of deportation.
Presidential communications chief Eugenio Chicas said El Salvador was in talks to see how Salvadorans could be employed in Qatar, a wealthy country of some 2.6 million people that is scheduled to host the soccer World Cup in 2022.
""The kingdom of Qatar ... has held out the possibility of an agreement with El Salvador whereby Salvadoran workers could be brought across in phases (to Qatar),"" Chicas told reporters.

El Salvador's foreign minister, Hugo Martinez, is in Qatar until Friday and said in a statement that Salvadorans could work in engineering, aircraft maintenance, construction and agriculture.

Martinez also noted that Qatar had offered to provide health services to the Central American country, which is struggling with a weak economy and gang violence.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday said it would withhold about half the initial aid it planned to give a U.N. agency that serves the Palestinians, two weeks after President Donald Trump questioned the value of such funding.
In announcing that it would provide $60 million to the U.N. Relief and Welfare Agency (UNRWA) while withholding a further $65 million for now, the U.S. State Department said the aid group needed to make unspecified reforms.
Palestine Liberation Organization official Wasel Abu Youssef immediately criticized the move, casting it as a deliberate U.S. effort to deny the Palestinians their rights and linking it to Trump's widely criticized Dec. 6 decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was unaware of any cut in aid but he was ""very concerned"" about the possibility because it ""is an important factor of stability.""
UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krähenbühl said in a statement that the reduced U.S. contribution ""threatens one of the most successful and innovative human development endeavors in the Middle East."" 
The decision to keep back some money is likely to compound the difficulty of reviving Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and to further undermine Arabs' faith that the United States can act as an impartial arbitrator.
The last talks collapsed in 2014, partly because of Israel’s opposition to an attempted unity pact between the Fatah and Hamas Palestinian factions and to Israeli settlement building on occupied land that Palestinians seek for a state, among other factors.
""UNRWA has proven time and again to be an agency that misuses the humanitarian aid of the international community and instead supports anti-Israel propaganda, perpetuates the plight of Palestinian refugees and encourages hate,"" said Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations.
Even if Washington provided the additional $65 million, the $125 million total would be well below the $355 million that a U.S. official said it gave UNRWA in the 2017 fiscal year ended Sept. 30. 
While saying the decision would sustain schools and health services, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert echoed Trump in calling on other nations to provide more money because he believes the United States pays more than its share.
The State Department wrote a letter notifying UNRWA of the decision, spokeswoman Nauert said. She said that while UNRWA reforms were a condition of releasing more money, the aid decision was ""not aimed at punishing"" anyone.
In a Twitter post on Jan. 2, Trump said that Washington gives the Palestinians ""HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect."" Trump added that ""with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?""
While U.S. officials did not link the decision to Trump's tweet, they made a point often advanced by him, saying the United States had been UNRWA’s single largest donor for decades.

Trump's aides initially debated whether to cut off all UNRWA aid, an unidentified U.S. official said, but hose opposed argued that could further destabilize the region.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former Central Intelligence Agency officer was arrested at a U.S. airport on Monday night in connection with charges that he illegally retained highly classified information, the U.S. Justice Department said Tuesday.
Jerry Chun Shing Lee, a U.S. citizen who now lives in Hong Kong, used to maintain a top secret clearance and began working for the CIA in 1994. 
The Justice Department said that in 2012, FBI agents searched his hotel rooms during trips to Virginia and Hawaii. They discovered he had two small books containing handwritten information on details such as the true names and numbers of spy recruits and covert CIA employees.
He was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. 
The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. But Lee made his first court appearance on Tuesday before a federal magistrate judge in Brooklyn. The judge ordered Lee held without bail.
A federal public defender who represented Lee at Tuesday's hearing declined to comment.
According to an affidavit filed by an FBI agent, Lee, 53, served in the U.S. Army from 1982 through 1986 and worked for the CIA from 1994 through 2007.
The FBI agent wrote that Lee and his family left Hong Kong in August 2012 to travel to northern Virginia. Along the way, they stayed in hotels where the FBI found the books.
The small books were discovered inside Lee's luggage, sealed in a small clear plastic travel pack. 
The handwritten information inside ranged in terms of classification, but the agent said at least one page contained top secret information, ""the disclosure of which could cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the United States.""
The agent also noted that classified cables Lee wrote while he was a case officer describing his interactions with CIA assets were reflected in the two books.
Lee was interviewed by the FBI five separate times in 2013 and never disclosed he had the books. He also met with former CIA colleagues around that time without returning the materials to the government, the Justice Department said.

By Frank Pingue
(Reuters) - Four-time Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles said on Monday she was sexually abused by former USA Gymnastics team physician Larry Nassar, the latest in a list of female athletes to accuse the doctor of misconduct.
The 20-year-old American, who was a key member of the U.S. team that won gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics, joins a number of top-level gymnasts who have accused Nassar of abuse, including Gabby Douglas, Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney.
""I too am one of the many survivors that was sexually abused by Larry Nassar,"" Biles, 20, wrote in a letter posted on her Twitter account. ""Please believe me when I say it was a lot harder to first speak those words out loud than it is now to put them on paper. There are many reasons that I have been reluctant to share my story, but I know now it is not my fault."" Nassar's attorney, Matt Newburg, said he had no comment on the latest allegations. Nassar was sentenced last month to 60 years in prison on federal child pornography charges and is set to be sentenced this week in Michigan after pleading guilty to additional counts of criminal sexual conduct related to allegations he assaulted girls under the guise of medical treatment. ""It is not normal to receive any type of treatment from a trusted team physician and refer to it horrifyingly as the 'special' treatment,"" Biles wrote. ""This behavior is completely unacceptable, disgusting, and abusive, especially coming from someone whom I was TOLD to trust."" Biles, who won a record three successive world all around titles before winning four gold medals at the 2016 Rio Olympics, said the alleged incidents left her broken and the more she tried to ""shut off the voice in my head the louder it screams."" She has been an elite gymnast since 2011 and after taking a break to enjoy life away from the gym, she is now training and planning to make her return at the U.S. Classic in late July with the goal of competing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. 
""It is impossibly difficult to relive these experiences and it breaks my heart even more to think that as I work towards my dream of competing in Tokyo 2020, I will have to continually return to the same training facility where I was abused,"" wrote Biles.

PERRIS, Calif. (Reuters) - The 13 siblings found starving in a filthy California home, some of them shackled to furniture, were getting food and treatment after being rescued from a ""horrific"" ordeal that could leave them scarred for years, authorities said on Tuesday.
Police were investigating the circumstances under which the parents - David Allen Turpin, 57, and Louise Anna Turpin, 49 - had subjected their children to abuse behind the doors of their darkened, foul-smelling home, Captain Greg Fellows of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said. 
The couple, who three times had traveled to Las Vegas to renew their wedding vows at an Elvis chapel, was arrested on Sunday. Each was charged with nine counts of torture and 10 counts of child endangerment and held on $9 million bail, with a court hearing scheduled for Thursday.
Authorities were alerted after one of the children, an emaciated, 17-year-old girl, called police after escaping through a window of the house in Perris, a city about 70 miles (115 km) east of Los Angeles.
""I wish I could come to you today with information that would explain why this happened,"" Fellows said, explaining the investigation was ongoing. ""But we do need to acknowledge the courage of the young girl who escaped from that residence to bring attention so they could get the help they so needed.”
The teen used a deactivated cellphone to call police, Fellows said. Cellphones deactivated for service can still make calls to the 911 emergency number, police said.
Police said they found three of the couple's 13 children, who range in age from 2 to 29, chained inside the filthy residence in a suburban housing tract. 
Police noticed the children were malnourished, Fellows said, calling conditions ""horrific."" Even so, he said, the mother appeared ""perplexed"" about why the police were there.
""If you can imagine being 17 years old and appearing to be a 10-year-old, being chained to a bed, being malnourished, and injuries associated with that,"" Fellows said. ""I would call that torture."" 
Authorities were seeking court authorization to take custody of the children. The state Child Protective Services agency was assisting in an investigation. 
Some of the children were being fed and were in stable condition at a hospital, officials said.
The family has lived at the house since 2014, where the parents home-schooled their children, Fellows said. Six of the couple's children are minors, while the other seven are over 18, according to neighbors, meaning they are adults under the law.
Kimberly Milligan, 50, who lives across the street from the family, said she only saw the infant in the mother's arms and three other children since she moved in across the street two years ago, describing them as small and pale. 
""Why don't we ever see the kids?"" Milligan said she asked herself. ""In hindsight, we would have never thought this. But there were red flags. You never don't hear or see nine kids.""
Two years ago, while walking around the neighborhood admiring Christmas lights, Milligan said she had encountered three of the Turpin children and complimented them on the manger with a baby Jesus set up outside the house. She said the children froze, as if by doing so they could become invisible. 
""Twenty-year-olds never act like that,"" she said. ""They didn't want to have a social conversation.""
Nicole Gooding, 35, who has lived in the neighborhood for three years, said the first time she saw the family was two months ago when the mother and children were cleaning up their yard, which was full of weeds and overflowing trash cans. 
""I had never seen them at all until that day,"" she said.
MARRIAGE RENEWAL VOWS
The parents home-schooled the children strictly and required them to memorize long passages from the Bible, David Turpin’s parents, James and Betty Turpin of West Virginia, told ABC News.
The California Department of Education gave the Turpin address as the location of the Sandcastle Day School, with David Turpin as principal.
In 2010, David Turpin left his job at  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) , a company spokeswoman said. He also worked as an engineer at  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) . Both are aeronautics and defense companies.
Unable to keep up with the family's expenses, Turpin filed for bankruptcy in 2011, an attorney who represented him, Ivan Trahan, told Reuters on Tuesday. 
At the time, the lawyer said, the couple spoke highly of their children. A Northrop spokesman declined to say whether Turpin was currently employed there.
""We are deeply troubled by the nature of the allegations against Mr. Turpin,"" Northrop's Mark Root said in a statement.
David and Louise Turpin appeared to have had marriage-renewal ceremonies at least three times, in 2011, 2013 and 2015, at an Elvis Presley-themed chapel in Las Vegas, according to the chapel's YouTube page. One video shows the couple exchanging renewal vows in front of an Elvis impersonator. 
Another video showed 10 female children in matching purple plaid dresses walking down the aisle ahead of Louise toward David, who waited anxiously at the altar with two male children in suits.
A third male child dressed in a suit appeared later in the video during various dance performances with the Elvis impersonator and the family.
An Elvis Chapel representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
A joint Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that appeared to have been created by the parents showed the couple at the same chapel dressed in wedding clothes, surrounded by the 13 children. 

David Turpin's parents told ABC News they were ""surprised and shocked"" by the allegations, saying they could not understand ""any of this.""

The jury had earlier told the judge it was at an impasse, said Charles Shearson, a lawyer for one of the three defendants.
In July 2013, the downtown section of the town of Lac Megantic was destroyed following the derailment of a Montreal Maine & Atlantic Railway Ltd train carrying crude oil.
Locomotive engineer Tom Harding, 56, operations manager Jean Demaître, 53, and rail traffic controller Richard Labrie, 59, face charges of criminal negligence causing death in the crude-by-rail disaster, according to court documents.
The three worked for the now-defunct Montreal Maine & Atlantic railway which operated the runaway train that was carrying 7.7 million liters of volatile Bakken crude oil, according to a 2014 accident report. 
The derailment sparked calls to improve rail safety in North America, with Canada ending the use of one-man crews to move dangerous goods and enhancing protection standards for tank cars used to transport crude by rail.
The trial comes amid an expected resurgence in rail shipments of less volatile Canadian crude in 2018 as tight pipeline capacity is pushing more oil onto railroads. 
The jury, which has been in deliberations for six days, had previously asked Quebec Superior Court Judge Gaetan Dumas for a dictionary and to clarify judicial matters, like the concept of ""reasonable doubt,"" local media reported. Their request for the dictionary was refused.
All three pled not guilty and did not testify during the trial in Sherbrooke, Quebec.

PRISTINA/BELGRADE (Reuters) - Kosovo Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic, who was standing trial over the killings of ethnic Albanians during the 1998-99 war, was shot dead on Tuesday in what Serbia called an act of terrorism. 
The killing increased tension between Kosovo and Serbia, and a round of European Union-sponsored dialogue on normalizing relations that was due to take place in Brussels was suspended at Belgrade's request.
The European Union, NATO and the United States urged both sides to remain calm, and Kosovo's authorities to bring the killers to justice. They also urged Serbia and its former province, which won independence a decade ago, to recommit to establishing normal relations.
After an emergency session of Serbia's National Security Council, President Aleksandar Vucic called the killing ""an act of terrorism"" and said Belgrade must be included in the investigation. He declined to say whether he believed the killing was ethnically motivated. 
Ivanovic, 64, was gunned down in front of his party office in Mitrovica, a town bitterly divided between ethnic Serbs and Albanians, shortly after 8 a.m. (0700 GMT). Doctors in hospital failed to revive him.
There were no witnesses and no shots were heard, suggesting the weapon had been fitted with a silencer, Serbian media reported. Tanjug news agency quoted his lawyer as saying Ivanovic had been shot at least five times.
Police found a burnt-out Opel car in the town after the shooting and suspected it was linked to the attack. They offered 10,000 euros ($12,200) for significant information, and provided a secure phone line.
The Kosovo government, which includes former commanders of ethnic Albanian guerrillas who rose up against Belgrade's repressive rule in the late 1990s, also condemned the attack.
""The killing of Oliver Ivanovic challenges the law and any attempt to establish law and order throughout the entire territory of Kosovo,"" it said in a statement.
Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj warned that the killing could be ""misused"" for political ends.
Kosovo's National Security Council also met, and said authorities might seek help from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
""BRIDGE-WATCHERS""
Known as a relative moderate among mainly ultra-nationalist Kosovo Serb politicians, Ivanovic became one of the chief interlocutors for NATO, U.N. and EU officials based in Kosovo to help steer it towards stable democracy and rule of law. 
In 2016, he was convicted of war crimes linked to the killings of four ethnic Albanians during the 1998-99 war and jailed for nine years. But after a retrial was ordered last year, he was released.
Serbian officials dismissed the accusations against Ivanovic and said the process against him was staged. 
Ivanovic came to prominence shortly after the war as one of the Mitrovica ""bridge-watchers"", Serbs who sought to prevent ""infiltration"" by Albanians over the Ibar River bridge into the northern half of the town.
The bridge-watchers were often involved in ethnic violence in the early post-war period, after NATO air strikes drove out Serbian forces accused of killing and expelling Kosovo Albanian civilians in a counter-insurgency campaign.
The group later disbanded but many members moved into organized crime. Ivanovic entered politics and became known for advocating dialogue and compromise with Kosovo Albanians, while still rejecting Kosovo's sovereignty. 
Some 40,000-50,000 ethnic Serbs live in northern Kosovo, resisting integration with the rest of the mainly ethnic Albanian country.
Relations between Serbia and Kosovo have been tense since 2008, but in 2013 both parties agreed to participate in EU-sponsored reconciliation talks, a condition for both to progress towards membership of the bloc.
Hundreds gathered in front of Belgrade's biggest church to light candles to Ivanovic. 
""Ivanovic was an honest politician, which is a rare quality, and a great Serb. He was one the few who could bring Serbs and Albanians together,"" said 28-year-old carpenter Aleksandar Petrovic.

The Russian-made MI-17 helicopter, carrying eight army personnel and two civilians, crashed on Tuesday morning on route from the town of Caucasia. Staff onboard the helicopter were set to inspect army gasoline storage facilities.
""The hypothesis is of an accident, it is being investigated,"" General Juan Vicente Trujillo, head of the army's aviation division, told journalists, ruling out an attack as the cause of the crash. 
The National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group, which recently restarted attacks after the end of a ceasefire with the government, is active in the area.

Colombia reached a peace agreement with the now-disbanded Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group last year, ending five decades of war. But the ELN, FARC dissidents, right-wing ex-paramilitaries and crime gangs remain active.

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 02:52PM ET</span>",Split Social Democrats could sink Merkel's coalition plans,"By Madeline Chambers and Tom Käckenhoff
BERLIN/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - The leader of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) tried on Tuesday to quash a grassroots rebellion against a blueprint agreed with Angela Merkel's conservatives to enter formal talks on a ""grand coalition"" which could scupper her plan for a fourth term.
After five days of talks, SPD leader Martin Schulz agreed a framework deal with Merkel and Bavarian conservatives on Friday. But before he can start official negotiations he needs the backing of his party in a vote at a conference on Sunday.
Convincing them is proving difficult. Two regional branches have already said they do not back his deal. Many rank and file members accuse Schulz of selling out to Merkel and failing to win a signature policy to take to coalition talks, such as a major healthcare reform or tax hikes for the rich. 
Schulz is touring the country to convince his party base.
Speaking to reporters before meeting SPD members in the western city of Duesseldorf, Schulz said the coalition blueprint had enough ""political substance"" to start detailed negotiations.
""We want to put the SPD into a position ... in which it can make our country better,"" Schulz said. Two dozen young SPD members protested against another grand coalition, or ""Groko"", government with Merkel's conservatives, holding up placards reading ""Groko is rubbish"" and ""Groko never again.""
In a live Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) broadcast, Schulz said the party had a duty to look at how it could improve the life of people.
""We are living in the world of (U.S. President Donald) Trump, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, (Turkish President Tayyip) Erdogan. We live in a world of dictators who make the world's breath pause with their crazed ideas ... And we have the chance to make Europe a bit more social, peaceful and just.""
If the SPD rejects entering talks on Sunday, the prospect looms of a new election or a minority government under Merkel, both unwelcome options for stability-loving Germans.
Defeat would also almost certainly mean the end of Schulz's leadership of the SPD. 
Uncertainty over the shape of the government in Europe's biggest economy is worrying investors, nearly four months after an election in which the conservatives had their worst result since 1949 and the SPD their worst since World War Two. Both of the parties that have dominated Germany for generations bled support to the far right AfD, which joined parliament for the first time, becoming the third biggest bloc. 
Many in the SPD are wary of a re-run of the grand coalition which ruled under Merkel between 2013 and 2017. A junior role leaves them in her shadow, unable to win credit from voters.
The SPD had vowed to go into opposition after its dismal election result but was forced to reconsider in the interest of national stability after Merkel was humiliated by the collapse of three-way talks on a coalition with other parties. 
Coalitions under Merkel - http://tmsnrt.rs/2AdhTpO
STRONG FEELING
Highlighting the strength of feeling, regional party branches in Berlin and the state of Saxony Anhalt have already signaled their opposition to the deal.
""A renewed grand coalition cannot be the result of talks. We reject the start of coalition negotiations with the conservatives,"" said the motion by Berlin's SPD chief Michael Mueller which was passed.
It said proposals on home building, rents and migration and integration were unsatisfactory, and expressed disappointment over the absence of plans to shake up the health system.
The SPD's youth wing, Jusos, opposes the deal and its head, Kevin Kuehnert, is undertaking his own ""NoGroKo Tour"".
However, it is difficult to predict the outcome of Sunday's vote as the regional results are not binding. At the Bonn congress 600 delegates are free to vote how they wish.
Both states that have rejected the agreement so far are relatively small. Schulz is trying to woo delegates in the biggest state, North Rhine-Westphalia, which has more than a quarter of the votes, in a series of events this week.
Trade unions, some other localities and the state of Brandenburg, have already said they back the deal.
Some leading SPD members argue Sunday's vote is only on the blueprint for a final deal and details can still be negotiated. After any final coalition deal, the SPD's 443,000 members will be balloted.
Some conservatives have expressed confidence that the SPD will back the blueprint. ""I can only recommend moving at top speed,"" said Bavarian conservative Alexander Dobrindt. 
""I look forward to starting coalition negotiations on Monday,"" he said, adding his only concern was the ""masochistic way"" the SPD had of talking down its successes.

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will hog the limelight at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos next week, but behind the scenes some of the world's leading diplomats will be working on some of humanity's knottiest conflicts.
Trump is expected to arrive on Jan. 25 and make a speech on Jan. 26 at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT). Eight U.S. Secretaries and cabinet members will also be at Davos.
""The U.S. footprint this year will be quite considerable,"" WEF president Borge Brende told Reuters.
""What we have heard so far is that he wants to meet with business people from Europe and also from the rest of the world, and he wants to then share with all of the participants his outlook for 2018.""
Trump's visit has created extra interest because Davos is emblematic of the globalisation that he criticized heavily during his election campaign, and its collaborative ethos is at odds with his ""America first"" isolationism.
WEF founder Klaus Schwab told a news conference that a theme this year would be the future of global co-operation relating to trade, environment, the fight against terrorism, tax systems and competitiveness. 
""In this context, it’s absolutely essential that we have President Trump with us,"" he said.
Trump will be just one of a record line-up of political leaders, from Angolan President João Lourenço to Zimbabwe's Emmerson Mnangagwa.
One invitee who has yet to confirm is Germany's Angela Merkel.
""She is very much welcome if that is her decision,"" said Brende, who stepped down as Norway's foreign minister late last year to take up his WEF role.
He is beefing up the political ambitions of Davos, a retreat more commonly associated with power-broking by wheeler-dealer billionaires.
Among the hundreds of meetings will be closed-door special ""diplomatic sessions"" devoted to conflicts and reconciliation, including Syria, Somalia, Venezuela, Israel-Palestine, the Korean peninsula and the Western Balkans. 
""I think it would be a lost opportunity with so many leaders at the start of the year if we didn’t also address peace and reconciliation questions in Davos,"" Brende said. 
Davos attendees include King Abdullah of Jordan, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Al-Hamdallah and Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
""I hope that there will be at least discussions on the situation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and we will have a lot of key players in that ecosystem in Davos,"" Brende said, adding that business leaders from both sides would call for a peace solution at Davos. 

The exclusive venue gives key political actors the chance to meet out of the public eye, or to communicate indirectly, he said.

The station gave no further details. There were no reports of casualties or damage.
The Iranian-aligned Houthis have fired several missiles at the kingdom, and while these have not caused any serious damage they have served to deepen tensions between Riyadh and its arch rival Tehran.
Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of supplying missile parts and expertise to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and other parts of the country during its civil war. Iran denies the charge.
Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition that has been fighting the Houthis in neighboring Yemen since March 2015, after the movement drove Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile.
Saudi Arabia said on Nov. 4 it had intercepted a ballistic missile over Riyadh's King Khaled Airport, an attack that led the coalition to close air, land and sea access to Yemen in a move it said was meant to stop Iranian supplies to the Houthis.
The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced over two million and brought much of the country to the brink of famine.

Vessels belonging to the Italian coastguard and finance police, the European Union anti-smuggling operation, Sophia, and ships run by humanitarian groups took part in 11 rescue operations, a statement said.
No details about the nationalities of those rescued were given, nor was there further information about the deaths.
Though hundreds of thousands of migrants have reached Europe via Italy after setting off in boats from North Africa over the past four years, it is unusual to see so many rescued on a single day during the winter when the seas tend to be rough.
So far this year 974 migrants had reached Italy by sea, down from 2,393 during the same period last year, the Interior Ministry said earlier on Tuesday before the latest rescues.
Immigration is one of the hot-button issues ahead of a national election on March 4. The ruling Democratic Party has pointed to a sharp fall in arrivals from Libya since July as proof that it is now managing what before seemed like an endless flow of migrant boats.
Arrivals fell by a third last year to 119,000 compared with a year earlier, and they tumbled by two thirds in the second half of the year. The declines came after a deal with the Tripoli government sealed in February, which foresaw aid and training for the Libyans to fight people smuggling and to bolster their coastguard.
More than 20,000 are estimated to have died attempting the crossing to Italy in the past four years, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates, making it the deadliest border for migrants in the world.
The Northern League, which is a member of the center-right coalition leading in polls ahead of the vote, on Monday vowed to stop the migrant ""invasion"".

""We believe the suspects spied on institutions and persons in Germany on behalf of an intelligence unit associated with Iran,"" said Frauke Koehler, a spokeswoman for the Federal Prosecutors Office.
The investigation was prompted by a tip-off from Germany's domestic intelligence service, the spokeswoman said, adding that no suspects had been arrested.
She declined to comment on a report by German magazine Focus that the suspects were spying on Israelis in Germany. 
No one could be immediately reached for comment at the Iranian Embassy in Berlin.
Germany last month summoned Iran's ambassador to warn Tehran against spying on individuals and groups with close ties to Israel, calling such acts an unacceptable breach of German law. The move came after the conviction of a Pakistani man for spying for Iran in Germany went into force.

State news agency SANA said the detainees had been held for between eight months and three years in the suburb east of Damascus where almost 400,000 people have been under siege by President Bashar al-Assad's forces since 2013.
Eastern Ghouta is the last major rebel position close to the capital.
In late December a deal was reached between Damascus and the rebels to evacuate critical medical cases in exchange for detainee releases. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross said in December that 29 of the most serious cases had been allowed to enter government territory for treatment under the deal.
SANA said a number of detainees were also released at the end of December under the deal. 
Around 600 people remain on the medical evacuation list, the U.N. World Health Organization said. 
A U.N. official in Syria confirmed the release of around 24 people to Reuters, saying they were civilians who had been kidnapped by rebels and that some of them had been held for up to three years. 
The map of Syria's seven-year conflict has been decisively redrawn in favor of Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies during the past two years.
They have recaptured major population centers in western Syria from rebels seeking to overthrow him and pushed back Islamic State in the east. 
Backed by Russian strikes, Syrian government forces have escalated military operations against Eastern Ghouta in recent months, seeking to tighten a siege that residents and aid workers say is a deliberate use of starvation as a weapon of war, a charge the government denies. 
Eastern Ghouta is suffering severe shortages of food, fuel and drinking water, World Food Programme spokesperson Bettina Luescher said on Tuesday.
""We have seen many cases of severe malnutrition, some of the people have been eating animal fodder and garbage. The plight of people, we have flagged that before, is really amazing, how they survive,"" she said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's new government after its March presidential election should invest more in education and healthcare to help spur economic growth, the World Bank's chief executive officer said on Tuesday.
President Vladimir Putin, in power for 18 years, is widely expected to win a further six-year term in the March election and to reshuffle his government.
""What we agree is that the new political cycle opens opportunities for new policy ideas to be brought forward,"" World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of an economic forum in Moscow.
""The key point is investment in people, in education, in health, in quality of social services. The government recognizes that, (but this is) not yet quite reflected in the share of education and health in GDP,"" she added.
Earlier on Tuesday Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the Rossiya 24 TV channel the government was considering an overhaul of the tax system, partly in order to generate more funds for investment in education, healthcare and infrastructure.
Russian state spending on education and health each accounted for less than four percent of national output in 2017, Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said in an interview with Russia's RBC TV last year.
These levels of spending are well below those seen in most Western countries.
Georgieva, a Bulgarian national and a former deputy head of the European Commission, said Russia had successfully reined in once stubbornly high inflation, helping to boost consumer confidence, and adopted a fiscal rule that had reduced its vulnerability to oil price fluctuations.
""The question is, what more Russia can do to lift up growth further?""
The World Bank expects the Russian economy to expand by 1.7 percent this year, when the global economy is seen growing by 3.1 percent. In 2019 the bank sees Russia's economic growth picking up to 1.8 percent.
Georgieva also urged Russia to invest more in new technologies, though it is still under Western economic sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis and its economy is still hampered by relatively low global energy prices.
World Bank data shows only 10 percent of Russian companies report innovation playing a significant role in their business in contrast to 30-40 pct in member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

""We believe that Russia can catch up with the world in terms of growth provided that some of these critical public policy shifts and investments are being made,"" Georgieva said.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's center-left leader Matteo Renzi is no longer the politician he once was, the chief executive of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said on Tuesday, indicating their once strong ties had withered.
Renzi resigned as prime minister in 2016 after losing a referendum on electoral reform. Although he remained in charge of the ruling Democratic Party (PD), he has struggled to regain the political initiative and is trailing in the opinion polls ahead of a March 4 national election.
""I always liked him as a person. I don't understand what has happened to him,"" Fiat Chrysler's Sergio Marchionne told Italian reporters at the Detroit auto show. ""The Renzi that I used to support hasn't been seen for a while,"" he added.
There was no immediate response from Renzi. As head of one of Italy's iconic companies, Marchionne's comment will carry far in the country.
Renzi raised eyebrows when he struck up a close rapport with Marchionne during his three years in government, defying the leftist tradition of standing arm-in-arm with the unions rather than big bosses.
An unapologetic Renzi explained the shift by saying his priority was to help job creators and accused unions of looking after the interests of pensioners rather than workers.
Hardliners quit the PD last year, complaining that the party had shifted too far to the right. They have created a breakaway group called Free and Equal which has hurt Renzi in the polls.
After winning 40 percent in European parliamentary elections in 2014, the PD is now predicted to win only around 23 percent backing in March against some 37 percent for the center-right bloc and 27 for the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. [nL8N1OS2Q2]
""Renzi has squandered political capital and has failed basically,"" said Giovanni Orsina, professor of modern history at Rome's Luiss University, predicting further schisms within the PD if it loses more ground in the forthcoming election.
While Renzi's own approval rating has dropped in line with that of his party, other PD heavyweights still enjoy strong support -- notably Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, who emerged as Italy's most respected politician in a weekend poll.
The Ixe survey said Gentiloni had a 35-percent approval rating, against 27 percent for the next most popular leader, the head of 5-Star, Luigi Di Maio.
Renzi hinted on Sunday that he might not thrust himself forward once more as prime minister should the PD pull off a shock win in March, raising speculation that he might endorse instead the mild-mannered Gentiloni in an effort to win votes.
French President Emmanuel Macron and European economic and financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici have both warmly praised Gentiloni in recent days, making clear that he is their preferred candidate to regain power.

""It is up to Italians to decide how to vote, but let me say that Europe has been very lucky to have Gentiloni and I hope we can continue the work that we have started,"" Macron told a news conference in Rome last week. [nL8N1P65AU]

Perez, a photogenic ex police officer who once starred in an action film, last year used a stolen helicopter to attack government buildings and stole weapons from a military base in what he called a rebellion against President Nicolas Maduro. 
He appeared with a bloody face in nearly a dozen Instagram videos early on Monday, saying he was surrounded by authorities shooting at him with grenade launchers even though he was promising to surrender.
Interior Minister Nestor Reverol in a press conference said seven ""terrorists"" including Perez were killed in the operation outside Caracas along with two police officers involved in the raid. He said Perez' group had attacked first and that officials had acted in self-defense. 
Maduro's socialist government has described Perez as a ""fanatic, extremist terrorist"" and had been carrying out a manhunt for him since last June. 
Government critics initially questioned whether Perez' attacks were staged in cahoots with the government to justify a further crackdown on the opposition. 
But his death prompted an outcry over what critics called an extrajudicial killing and turned him into a martyr for hard-line foes of Maduro. 

""Honor and glory to those brave citizens who gave their life for their ideals,"" tweeted former Caracas mayor Antonio Ledezma, now in exile in Spain after himself being jailed on charges of leading a coup against Maduro.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African authorities want global consultancy McKinsey and a local firm controlled by business friends of President Jacob Zuma to repay 1.6 billion rand ($130 million) they earned from a contract to advise state utility Eskom.
Tuesday's announcement deepens the financial and reputational harm done to McKinsey in the country over the case, and the opposition said it was a fresh example of Zuma's role in state corruption.
Officials are investigating whether McKinsey knowingly let funds from the utility be diverted to Trillian management consultancy as a way of securing the deal to advise Eskom in 2016. The firm was at the time controlled by Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, three brothers close to Zuma.
The move to recover money from McKinsey and Trillian comes after a court last month granted prosecutors the authority to freeze 1.6 billion rand of assets over the Eskom turnaround program.
It is one of the first instances in which the government has acted publicly against the brothers, who an anti-corruption watchdog has accused of using their friendship with Zuma to siphon off public funds.
As such, it reflects Zuma's weakened position since he was replaced last month by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa as head of the ruling African National Congress. Ramaphosa won the closely fought party vote on a pledge to root out corruption in government.
""The 1.6 billion, we are asking that they pay that back. That precisely relates to the Eskom contract,"" Knorx Molelle, a senior prosecutor from the National Prosecuting Authority's Asset Forfeiture Unit (NPA) told eNCA television.
Molelle said the Authority was not about to seek arrests or court summonses prior to the end of an investigation. The NPA did not respond to a request for comment.
Mmusi Maimane, leader of South Africa's largest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said the Guptas and Zuma should be prosecuted for their role in state corruption.
""It is no secret that President Zuma is deeply compromised and implicated in this matter through his well-known relationship with the Guptas,"" Maimane said in a statement.
A spokesman for McKinsey said on Monday the firm would cooperate with authorities in their investigations and that it was ready to return the roughly 1 billion rand it had earned for advising Eskom.
McKinsey launched an internal investigation into its handling of the partnership with Trillian and says it ceased work with the firm in March 2016 after due diligence showed links to the Guptas.
Its comments contradict the account given to Reuters in November by four sources familiar with the Eskom deal. They said McKinsey continued working with Trillian for four months after learning of its links to the Guptas.
McKinsey has lost several prominent clients including South Africa's Standard Bank since the scandal broke.
Trillian, the junior consultant on the Eskom contract, did not respond to a request for comment. When contacted in November, Trillian denied wrongdoing relating to the Eskom contract.
Zuma this month said he would set up a commission of enquiry into allegations of influence-peddling by the Gupta brothers.
Both Zuma and the Guptas deny wrongdoing. Zuma's spokesman did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",World Bank joins IMF in criticism of Ukraine's anti-corruption draft law,"KIEV (Reuters) - The World Bank has joined the International Monetary Fund in criticizing a Ukrainian draft law to create an anti-corruption court, the newspaper Ukrainska Pravda reported on Monday, citing a letter from the lender to the presidential administration.
In response to international pressure to speed up the process, President Petro Poroshenko submitted a new draft law to parliament in December, but the IMF and now the World Bank say the legislation is not in line with recommendations from the Venice Commission, a European rights and legal watchdog.
Ukraine's Western backers have long called for the authorities to establish an independent court to handle corruption cases. Slow progress has delayed the disbursement of foreign loans. 
The World Bank's country director, Satu Kahkonen, has written to the presidential administration to express the bank's concerns about parts of the bill, Ukrainska Pravda said, publishing what it said was the text of the letter in full.
""We believe that the draft law requires the following revisions to bring it into alignment with the recommendations of the Venice Commission and satisfy the requirements of the World Bank's estimated $800 million Policy-Based Guarantee to support key reforms in Ukraine,"" she said, in a letter dated Jan. 15.
Among its recommendations, it says the court's future jurisdiction needs to be better aligned with that of anti-corruption investigators and prosecutors. 
The World Bank in Ukraine did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Ukrainska Pravda report.
The letter cited echoes one sent by the IMF to the president's office earlier in January which warned that the draft law did not guarantee the independence of the court.
The presidential administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
On Monday, in response to the IMF's letter, it denied the law was not in line with Venice Commission recommendations and said the authorities had the political will to create an independent anti-corruption court. 
Since its 2013-14 pro-European uprising, Ukraine has received $8.4 billion from the IMF and over $5 billion from the World Bank among other backers, helping it to return to growth of over 2 percent in 2016.
However the disbursement of funding was held up last year over perceived backtracking on reform commitments that raised doubts about the authorities' will to eliminate corruption and modernize the economy.

1367,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 11:29AM ET</span>",U.S. warily eyeing new Russian air defenses in Crimea,"By Phil Stewart
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States is assessing the security implications of Russia's latest deployment of S-400 air defenses to Crimea, a U.S. military official said on Tuesday, adding it could give existing Russian defenses more resilience.
""It's not good. It doesn't bode well,"" a senior U.S. official at the U.S. military's European Command said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""We certainly are paying attention to it and what that means, as far as the security of the Black Sea.""
Moscow's deployment on Saturday added a second division of S-400 surface-to-air missiles in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, triggering economic sanctions by the European Union and United States.
It deployed its first division of S-400s in the spring of 2017 near the port town of Fedosia. The new division will be based next to the town of Sevastopol and will control the airspace over the border with Ukraine, the RIA news agency reported.
The U.S. military official acknowledged that it was difficult to assess the goal of the deployment. Any air defenses of that kind, however, add Russian military capability to Crimea, providing additional resilience and, potentially, coverage.
""If the intent should arise, it gives opportunities to either defend a little bit more of the Black Sea or to advance from there,"" the official said, without predicting any future Russian actions.
""We look at it as just another affirmation of their will to use military force."" 
NEW FIGHTING
Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists have accused each other in recent days of ramping up attacks in their conflict. 
Five Ukrainian servicemen have been killed so far this year and another roughly 20 were wounded, according to Reuters calculations based on daily data from the Ukrainian military.
The new air defense system, designed to defend Russia's borders, can be turned into combat mode in less than five minutes, Interfax news agency quoted Viktor Sevostyanov, a commander with Russia's air forces, as saying.
Russian officials have criticized a U.S. decision announced in December to provide Ukraine with defensive weaponry, which officials said included Javelin anti-tank missiles. 
Washington has argued in the past that such weapons cannot effectively be used to take territory and U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford said during a trip to Brussels this week that the move was strictly defensive.
""Our government believes that a nation has the right to defend itself and the support that we've provided to Ukraine was directly focused on areas where they had capability gaps,"" Dunford said.

1368,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 11:09AM ET</span>",Palestinians see Gaza peace dividend pass them by,"By Nidal al-Mughrabi
GAZA (Reuters) - Life began to look up for Gaza's Palestinians when reconciliation between its Hamas Islamist rulers and the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority in October brought a drop in crippling prices.
Three months on, discount stickers still adorn goods from clothes to cars but few of the two million people in the enclave blockaded by Israel are buying.
Although Hamas handed administrative control to the Western-backed PA, which lifted tax surcharges Hamas had imposed on businesses, making room for the price cuts, the rival leaderships are still arguing.
The result is that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads the PA, has not reversed a 30 percent wage cut he imposed in April on 60,000 civil servants who stayed on the PA's payroll when the authority lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007.
Many of those employees are now mired in debt to banks for loans they took out to get by.
The salary reductions ""deprived the Gaza market of $160 million in the past eight months"", said Maher al-Tabbaa, an official with the Chamber of Commerce.
For individuals, the consequences are stark. In a Gaza pharmacy this week, Umm Ahmed considered which medicines on the prescription she had been given for her son she could afford.
""Even in my dreams I never thought we would live through such misery,"" she said as she chose two painkillers and left more expensive antibiotics in the drug store.
Tabbaa said any economic improvement in Gaza was largely dependent on Israel lifting the tight border restrictions it imposed after Hamas took power, a view that echoes World Bank reports over the years.
Israel cites security concerns for the measures, which include a naval blockade, an almost blanket ban on exports from the territory and restrictions on the import of items such as steel in case militants use them to make arms or fortifications.
Battling an Islamist insurgency in the Sinai desert that borders Gaza, Egypt, the main mediator of inter-Palestinian reconciliation, also invokes security considerations in keeping its border with the enclave largely closed.
INTERNATIONAL CONCERN
Many countries, concerned over deepening economic hardship in Gaza, have urged more open borders.
The World Bank said in September alleviating restrictions on the movement of goods and people would allow critical trade to rebuild infrastructure and economy, both hit hard by a seven-week war between Israel and Gaza militants in 2014.
Some 550 Gaza traders had permission to enter Israel as of December 2017, a drop of 85 percent since late 2015, according to a Palestinian committee that transfers entry requests to Israeli authorities.
Israel has said some permits were used to arrange smuggling of material, weapons or money to militants.
The World Bank projected real GDP growth of 4.0 percent in Gaza for 2017, not enough to prevent a near stagnation in real per capita income and an increase in unemployment.
Tabbaa put current unemployment in Gaza at 46 percent.
WEAK SALES
""Metro"" the second largest supermarket in Gaza, said sales had dropped to their lowest point since the business opened several years ago.
""People are only buying the very basic things, the most important of the important stuff,"" Khalil al-Yazji, one of the owners, said. ""We are unable to cover operating costs.""
The supermarket has dropped some staff and cut back on imports, fearing new stocks would only expire on the shelves.
In Gaza's once bustling Old Market, spice store owner Mamdouh Zeineldeen said he might have to close his business.
""Markets are collapsing, just like reconciliation,"" he said.
The effects of armed conflict and economic woes in Gaza are also evident at Kerem Shalom, the only commercial crossing between Israel and the territory.
Some 800 to 1,000 truckloads of goods for Gaza pass through Kerem Shalom every day, but Tabbaa said that number dropped to 400 in recent weeks after merchants cut imports due to weak consumer demand.
Tensions have also risen since President Donald Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy on Dec. 6 by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Sixteen Palestinian protesters have been killed in clashes with police and Gaza militants have launched 18 cross-border rockets or mortar bombs into Israel, which has responded with air strikes. The exchange of fire has largely avoided casualties, but two Palestinian gunmen were killed in one retaliatory strike. [nL8N1P433C]
Israel closed Kerem Shalom on Saturday, a day before it destroyed what it said was a Hamas attack tunnel running underneath the facility.
The crossing reopened on Tuesday but further easing looks unlikely.
Hamas and the Palestinian Authority are still divided over the fate of 40,000 to 50,000 employees hired by Hamas since its 2007 takeover of Gaza. Security is another key sticking point, with Hamas still running the police and internal security in Gaza after handing administrative control to the PA.
Peace talks between Israel and Abbas's Palestinian Authority collapsed in 2014 and Palestinian unity was supposed to strengthen Abbas's hand in his bid to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza.
But Israel has balked at the reconciliation efforts, saying it would not negotiate with a Palestinian government dependent on support by Hamas, a group that advocates its destruction.

1369,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",Bosnia to investigate suspected Serb paramilitary group,"By Maja Zuvela
SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Bosnia's security agencies are investigating a Serbian right-wing group which the national government said on Tuesday was a paramilitary unit formed to create ""a problem"" for those opposed to Bosnian Serb President Milorad Dodik.
Members of Serbian Honour caused uproar when they marched in full combat gear in the Bosnian Serb capital Banja Luka during a Jan. 9 military parade to mark a national holiday in one the country's two autonomous regions. 
The parade was staged as a challenge to a ruling by Bosnia's Constitutional Court to ban the holiday as it discriminated against the country's other ethnic groups. Bosnia is split into the Federation, shared by the Bosnian Croats and Muslim Bosniaks, and the Serb-dominated Serb Republic. 
Serbian Honour is registered in neighboring Serbia but has an informal wing in the Bosnian Serb Republic, whose leaders say they are in the process of registering as a charity there.
""For me this is a paramilitary formation,"" Security Minister Dragan Mektic told a news conference on Tuesday. ""The way they showed up is dangerous and their claims to be a charity are ridiculous.""
Dodik's office said the reports were false and dangerous.
Mektic, member of a party that opposes Dodik, said the group was formed to ""sow fear"" and ""pass a pre-election message that those who oppose the current government will have a problem"". 
A national election is due in Bosnia in October. 
Dodik's SNSD party, which had been the dominant Bosnian Serb party at regional and national levels since 2006, saw its popularity slide in the last national vote and was excluded from a ruling coalition.
Bosnian investigative web portal Zurnal, without citing sources, said the group had been trained in a Russian-funded humanitarian center in Serbia and would be organized to act against Dodik's political opponents.
The Russian Embassy said it did not even want to comment on something so ridiculous.
Mektic compared the group to paramilitary groups led by criminal gang leaders that emerged on the eve of Bosnia's war in the 1990, and later committed some of the most gruesome atrocities against civilians during the conflict. 
""What we need the least is the repetition of such events,"" Mektic warned. ""I call on all institutions to protect this country and I expect a quick response.""
Mektic told reporters he could not provide much of the operational data, but said the case would be documented and forwarded to the prosecutor this week.
Concerns are high regarding increasing instability in the Balkans, including secessionist pressures in Bosnia, a parliamentary boycott in Montenegro and renewed tensions between Serbia and its former province of Kosovo.
Western leaders have accused Russia, traditional ally of Serbs, of seeking to exploit diminishing EU leverage in the Balkans by manipulating political events in the region. Russia denies such allegations.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday he was discussing with India ways to strengthen security cooperation against the menace of from Islamist extremism that both democracies faced.
Netanyahu spoke while on a six-day tour of India, the first by an Israeli premier for 15 years, and is being feted by Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, whose Hindu nationalist party has long admired Israel for its tough posture against terrorism.
India, wary of upsetting Arab nations on which it was dependent for oil, and heeding the sentiments of its own large Muslim minority, kept a distance from Israel for decades. But under Modi, the two sides have embraced a closer relationship based on security and economics.
The right-wing Netanyahu told a security conference that India and Israel were two democracies with a natural affinity, but their open and liberal societies faced risks.
""Our way of life is being challenged, most notably, the quest for modernity, the quest for innovation (are) being challenged by radical Islam and its terrorist offshoots from a variety of corners,"" he said.
Both Israel and India have long sought to counter militant Islamists - in Israel's case, mainly from Gaza and Egypt's Sinai region and, in India's case, mainly from Pakistan. Away from the public eye, India and Israel have been cooperating against the threat through, in part, intelligence sharing, officials say. 
""We've discussed in this visit how we can strengthen our two nations in the civilian areas, in security areas, in every area,"" Netanyahu told the conference.
His trip to India comes just six months after Modi made the first trip by an Indian prime minister to Israel, during which he did not go to Ramallah, seat of the self-ruling Palestinian Authority and a customary stop for leaders visiting the region.
Netanyahu toured the Taj Mahal on Tuesday and will also visit Modi's home state of Gujarat and India's financial capital Mumbai. 
He will join an 11-year-old Israeli boy, Moshe Holtzberg, whose parents were murdered by Pakistan-based militants in Mumbai in 2008, for a memorial event at the Indian financial hub's Jewish center where the attack took place. 

The boy, who lives with his grandparents in Israel, arrived on Tuesday as a guest of Modi.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 10:34AM ET</span>","Pope, in Chile, expresses 'pain and shame' over Church sex abuse scandal","By Philip Pullella and Dave Sherwood 
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Pope Francis expressed ""pain and shame"" on Tuesday over a sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church in Chile, seeking forgiveness for a crisis that has scarred its credibility and left many faithful skeptical of reform.
Francis spoke as the number of Catholic churches that have been attacked in the country in the past week rose to eight, both in the capital and in southern regions that are home to indigenous people.
Police in riot gear dispersed some 200 demonstrators trying to make their way to a park where the pope said Mass for some 400,000 people after making his remarks about abuse.
""Here I feel bound to express my pain and shame at the irreparable damage caused to children by some ministers of the Church,"" he said in the presidential palace, drawing sustained applause, including from President Michelle Bachelet and diplomats.
""I am one with my brother bishops, for it is right to ask for forgiveness and make every effort to support the victims, even as we commit ourselves to ensuring that such things do not happen again,"" he said.
Catholics have been upset with Francis' appointment in 2015 of Bishop Juan Barros to head the small diocese of Osorno in south-central Chile.
Barros, who attended Tuesday's Mass, has been accused of protecting his former mentor, Father Fernando Karadima, who was found guilty in a Vatican investigation in 2011 of abusing teenage boys over many years. Karadima has denied the allegations and Barros said he was unaware of any wrongdoing.
But the scandal has gripped Chile, and, along with growing secularization, has hurt the standing of a Church that defended human rights during the 1973-1990 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.
A poll by Santiago-based think tank Latinobarometro this month showed that the number of Chileans calling themselves Catholics fell to 45 percent last year, from 74 percent in 1995.
A group opposed to the pope's visit posted on Twitter: ""No more abuse, no more cover-ups, no more hypocrisy.""
At least eight Catholic churches have been attacked in Chile over the past week, including one with a homemade bomb where vandals left a pamphlet reading: ""Pope Francis, the next bomb will be in your robe.""
ANTI-POPE GRAFFITI
Hours after the pope arrived in Chile on Monday, two small wooden churches were burned to the ground near Temuco, where Francis is due to visit on Wednesday.
The indigenous Mapuche in the area accuse the state and private companies of taking their ancestral lands. The Mapuche say the pope's ceremony will be held on seized land. 
A church in the capital was attacked during the night, causing minor damage. Vandals burned Chilean and Vatican flags at the site and tossed pamphlets with threats against the pope.
Graffiti on one Santiago church read ""Burn pope and ""pope accomplice.""
About 10 blocks from Tuesday's Mass, riot police clashed with some 200 people protesting against the sexual abuse scandal and the $17 million cost of the papal visit. ""Complicit Pedophiles,"" read one of the banners.
But the welcome most Chileans have given the first Latin American pope has been warm, with tens of thousands lining the streets.
Francis read the speech in the Moneda palace, which Pinochet's forces bombed from the air and with ground artillery on Sept. 11, 1973 while democratically elected President Salvatore Allende was inside.
The Argentine pope referred to that dark period, saying the country had ""faced moments of turmoil, at times painful."" He praised the consolidation of democracy but said more had to be done to help the unemployed and native people.
Chile, with a population of about 17.4 million, is the world's top copper producer, the fifth-largest economy in Latin America and one of the region's most stable countries.
Angelina Soto, 67, of San Francisco de Mostazal, south of Santiago, said she and her family arrived before sunrise for the Mass in the park.

""We are very committed Catholics, we've been singing all morning,"" she said. ""I think (the visit) will change Chile, it will make us more generous, and help to close the gap between rich and poor.""

As millions of people have poured out of Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey have taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees, while Greece has been used as a launchpad for many seeking to reach other European countries.
""We underlined the huge challenges our countries face on the refugee crisis and naturally the need for the international community to actively and effectively support countries which host large numbers of refugees,"" Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said after a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah and Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades in Nicosia.
He did not say what sort of support the countries want.

""We are shouldering an immense refugee burden and cannot be left alone as we undertake this humanitarian responsibility on behalf of the world.""
The three countries said they would seek to boost cooperation on issues such as water management, tourism projects and in the shipping sector. 
""It is no secret that we live in a very tough neighborhood, rife with challenges but also with opportunities and together, our chances of capitalizing on these opportunities ...increase tenfold,"" Abdullah said.
An agreement was also signed on the prevention of theft, illicit excavations and export of cultural property.

The mistake took place at a tense time in the region following North Korea's largest nuclear test to date in September and its claim in November that it had successfully tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach all of the U.S. mainland.
Pyongyang regularly threatens to destroy Japan and the United States.
But there were no immediate reports of panic or other disruptions following the NHK report. A similar gaffe caused panic in the U.S. state of Hawaii at the weekend.
NHK's 6.55 p.m. (0955 GMT) alert on its web site said: ""North Korea appears to have launched a missile...The government urges people to take shelter inside buildings or underground.""
The same alert was sent to mobile phone users of NHK's online news distribution service.
In five minutes, the broadcaster put out another message on the website correcting itself and said no government warning, called ""J-alert"", had been issued. 
""This happened because equipment to send a news flash onto the Internet had been incorrectly operated. We are deeply sorry,"" an NHK announcer said on its 9:00 p.m. news program, bowing deeply in apology. 
Last Saturday, a false missile alert during a civil defense drill caused panic across Hawaii. A state emergency management agency spokesman attributed it to human error and a lack of fail-safe measures.

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",Swiss campaign to curb immigration from EU gets go-ahead,"ZURICH (Reuters) - A Swiss far-right campaign to curb immigration from the European Union, potentially unraveling bilateral ties with the bloc, moved ahead on Tuesday when the government gave proponents a green light to start canvassing public support.
Should the initiative win the required 100,000 signatures by July 2019, it would go to a vote under the Swiss system of direct democracy. That could pave the way to scrapping the free movement of EU citizens now guaranteed under bilateral accords.
The populist Swiss People's Party (SVP) has long sought to limit immigration to neutral, landlocked Switzerland, whose population of 8.4 million is already one-quarter foreign. 
The European Union insists that its citizens must be able to live and work in non-member Switzerland as the price for enhanced Swiss access to the EU single market, the biggest for Swiss exports.
The latest campaign comes at a sensitive time for bilateral ties, which soured last month when Bern promised to retaliate over what it called unacceptable limitations on the access of Swiss stock exchanges to the EU single market.
Voters approved quotas on immigration in 2014 but parliament instead opted in 2016 for a system giving people registered as unemployed in Switzerland first crack at open jobs. This move skirted a clash with Brussels and averted a threat to bilateral relations.
The text of the new initiative states that Switzerland will unilaterally steer immigration and enter no accords granting foreigners free access. It would give the government 12 months to negotiate an end to the current free movement pact, one of more than 100 bilateral accords that regulate ties.
Should negotiations fail, the government has 30 days to cancel the free movement accord. This would almost certainly prompt Brussels to cancel an entire package of other bilateral agreements that stand or fall together.
A survey of more than 20,000 people by newspaper publisher Tamedia this week, however, found 55 percent opposed cancelling the free movement deal and 42 percent in favor.

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 09:46AM ET</span>",Bangladesh agrees with Myanmar to complete Rohingya return in two years,"By Ruma Paul and Yi-mou Lee
DHAKA/YANGON (Reuters) - Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed on Tuesday to complete within two years the return of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who had fled an army crackdown last year in Myanmar. 
The UN Refugee Agency, responding to the plan, raised a concern about forcibly repatriating over 650,000 Rohingya who fled to neighboring Bangladesh after a conflict erupted in western Rakhine state in August.
Statements from both the Myanmar and Bangladesh foreign ministries said Bangladesh would set up five transit camps on its side of the border. Those camps would send Rohingyas to two reception centers in Myanmar. The repatriation process would start next Tuesday, the statements said.
Myanmar said it would build a transit camp that can house 30,000 returnees. 
The Bangladesh statement said ""Myanmar has reiterated its commitment to stop (the) outflow of Myanmar residents to Bangladesh"".
Myanmar stressed the need for both sides to take preventive measures against possible Rohingya attacks and said it gave Dhaka a list with the names of 1,000 alleged militants.
The crisis erupted after Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts on Aug. 25 in Rakhine triggered a fierce military response that the United Nations denounced as ethnic cleansing. Some 650,000 people fled the violence.
The military denies ethnic cleansing, saying its security forces had mounted legitimate counter-insurgency clearance operations.
The Bangladesh statement called for repatriating orphans and ""children born out of unwarranted incidence"", a reference to cases of rape resulting in pregnancy, said a Bangladesh foreign ministry official who declined to be identified.
The rape of Rohingya women by Myanmar's security forces was widespread, according to interviews with women conducted at displacement camps by U.N. medics and activists. The military denies it was involved in any sexual assaults. 
VERIFICATION PROCESS
A spokesperson from the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) said on Tuesday the Rohingya should only return voluntarily when they feel it is safe to do so.
“Major challenges have to be overcome,” UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic told a Geneva news briefing. “These include ensuring they are told about the situation in their areas of origin ... and are consulted on their wishes, that their safety is ensured.” 
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay told Reuters last week the returnees could apply for citizenship ""after they pass the verification process"". 
Myint Kyaing, permanent secretary at Myanmar's Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population, told Reuters this month Myanmar would begin processing at least 150 people a day through each of the two camps by Jan. 23.
The meeting that concluded on Tuesday in Myanmar's capital Naypyitaw was the first for a joint working group set up to hammer out the details of the November repatriation agreement.
Left out of the talks were the fears and concerns of the refugees themselves, ""as if they are an inert mass of people who will go where and when they are told,"" Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, told Reuters in an email.
""Where are considerations for protection of the Rohingya from Myanmar security forces who months ago were raping and killing them? How come the discussions ignore the deprivation of rights of people held in indefinite detention, which is what these so-called “temporary” accommodations may become?,"" Robertson asked. 
'LIVING LIKE PRISONERS'
A group of refugees at the Kutupalong Rohingya camp near Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh expressed doubt about the camps Myanmar has agreed to establish on its side of the border. 
Mohammad Farouk, 20, who arrived in Bangladesh following the Aug. 25 attacks, said exchanging one camp for another made little difference - except ""the camps in Myanmar will be far worse, because we will be confined there and there will be a risk to our lives.”
Another resident of the Kutupalong camp compared the new transit camps to ones set up near the Rakhine state capital of Sittwe following bouts of violence in previous years ""where people are living like prisoners”. 
“First, ask the military to give those Rohingya their homes and property back, then talk to us about returning,” said the Rohingya refugee who did not want to be identified. 
Some said the kind of violence they witnessed toward their community in Myanmar made it hard for them to trust the military. “Even if I don’t get food or anything else here, at least there is safety. I won’t feel safe if I go back to Myanmar,” said Rashid Ahmed, 33. 
Noor Alam, 37, who came to Kutupalong five months back, wondered if he could ever get a job in Myanmar. “They don’t even call us Rohingya. Until they consider us citizens we won’t go back.”
Some young men in the camp worried they might be arrested on accusations of terrorism if they returned to Myanmar. 
Camp conditions in Bangladesh are dire enough, but more than 520,000 Rohingya children are at even greater risk ahead of the cyclone season that generally begins in April, the United Nations Children's Fund said on Tuesday.
""Hundreds of thousands of children are already living in horrific conditions, and they will face an even greater risk of disease, flooding, landslides and further displacement,” said Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF Representative in Bangladesh. 

Nearly 1 million Rohingya live in Bangladesh, including those who came after previous displacements dating back to the 1990s.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and European Union leaders should increase the pressure on President Bashar al-Assad and his allies Russia and Iran to return to talks to end Syria's civil war, Syria's chief opposition negotiator said on Monday.
Nasr Hariri, the chief negotiator for Syria's main opposition grouping, said that unless the West forced President Assad and his big power allies to seek peace then the blood of Syrian civilians would continue to be spilled.
""I would like to ask all those countries that promised they would support the Syrian people and their aspirations for democracy and peace: why didn't they fulfill their promises?"" Hariri, speaking in English, told Reuters in London.
He called for Trump and EU leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May to get tougher with Assad.
All diplomatic initiatives have so far failed to yield progress in ending the Syrian civil war, which is now entering its eighth year having killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven 11 million from their homes.
The map of Syria's conflict has been decisively redrawn in favor of Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies during the past two years. They have recaptured major population centers in western Syria from rebels seeking to overthrow him and pushed back Islamic State in the east. 
In the face of the collapse of rebel-held territory, most Western countries have quietly softened their positions that Assad must leave power as part of any peace deal. But the opposition entered the last formal talks last month without softening its demand Assad go, prompting the government to declare the talks pointless.
Nevertheless, Hariri suggested Western powers still had enough influence to push the government to negotiate.
""It is time for President Trump, Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister May to say: 'Stop',"" the former cardiologist said.
""It is time for Trump, Merkel and May to increase pressure and bring the international community together to get a genuine and just political situation in Syria.""
Hariri represents the Saudi-backed umbrella group of Syrian opposition groups which are opposed to Assad and supported by the West. He said the next round of the so-called ""Geneva talks"" on the fate of Syria would take place in late January, probably around Jan. 24-26 in Vienna.
MORE TALKS?
Hariri said discussions in Washington, including with White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster, had been positive and that the Trump administration understood the situation.
""Iran and Russia are trying to deprioritize the transition,"" he said. ""We need the international community's help to put pressure on the regime and their backers, Russia and Iran.""
""The Americans want to test the Russians and the regime in the next round of talks. They want to move the Geneva process forward,"" Hariri said.
When asked about U.S. plans to help support a 30,000-strong force dominated by the mainly Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), he said it could lead to Syria's partition. 
""What are the benefits of establishing such an army?"" he asked. ""It will open the door wide for a future struggle in the region. It could open the door to the future partition of Syria.""
Assad has responded to the plan by vowing to crush the new force and drive U.S. troops from Syria. Iran said on Tuesday creation of the SDF force would ""fan the flames of war"", echoing the vehement response of Syria, Turkey and Russia.
Hariri said it was very unlikely that the Syrian opposition would attend a meeting on Syria organized by Russia in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. The opposition had received no invitation so far, and no final decision on attendance had been made.

""We have not been invited yet,"" he said. ""The general mood is not to go to Sochi. My personal view is that in its current shape, it is unacceptable to attend Sochi.""

President Jacob Zuma said last month the government would bankroll the tuition without giving details of how it would be funded. The announcement rattled financial markets and critics said it was a populist promise that risked widening an already gaping budget deficit.
A government report and the treasury said the plan is unaffordable. Some critics also said the timing of the announcement, which came days before Zuma stepped down as leader of the ruling African National Congress, showed he no longer cared about fiscal responsibility.
Gigaba told reporters at a televised briefing in the capital Pretoria that costs estimates had been finalized and the plan would be implemented over eight years.
""The president found himself in an invidious position .... It is about how to manage the process and implement it in a sustainable manner without having to breach the fiscal expenditure ceiling,"" he said.""
""If the president had not acted this year to provide some funding it would have resulted in further protests,"" he said.

Since 2015 protests by students demanding free education rocked campuses across the country, disrupting teaching and examinations and culminating in a march to Zuma's offices in Pretoria that saw the president freeze tuition increases.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Loose or corroded joints may have caused the sudden collapse of a mezzanine floor at the Indonesian Stock Exchange building this week that sent visiting students plunging to the ground, a preliminary report by the public works ministry has found.
More than 70 people were injured in Monday's incident, which was captured on dramatic CCTV footage that showed a walkway giving way under the students, some of whom were trapped beneath slabs of concrete and other debris.
The accident in Jakarta's plush financial district has shocked even a country that is used to natural and manmade disasters and where safety standards are often loosely enforced.
The ministry's report said the suspended walkway fell because several cables broke away from the ceiling due to a ""concentration of weight"" in one spot where nearly 100 university students visiting the exchange had gathered.
""The burden could not be borne by the ... structure and triggered a building failure,"" said the report, which was reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday. 
The initial conclusion was that the collapse may have been caused by ""loose or corroded bolts"" or ""shearing joints"". 
The report said the walkway was part of the original structure, built in the late 1990s, and not added later.
The public works ministry said its report was based on interviews with building management, visual observations and analysis of CCTV footage on social media, but added that its team did not have direct access to the site. 
""Further and closer observation is required on-site, and of construction documents,"" it said.
The public works ministry's press department said in a statement: ""We would like to convey that this report is a preliminary report of the results of a review by ministry staff, that is unofficial.""
The high-rise building is part of a two-tower complex owned and developed by PT Danayasa Arthatama Tbk, part of Artha Graha group. It houses dozens of offices, including the World Bank's Indonesia branch.
A company spokesman had earlier declined to comment on the incident. No one from the company could immediately be reached for comment on the findings of the preliminary report.
""NO WARNING""
For some of the 92 accounting students, who had arrived hours earlier from Palembang city on the island of Sumatra to take a study tour of the stock exchange, it felt like a powerful earthquake.
One said that the students, aware of Jakarta's notorious traffic jams, arrived early and were looking for a Muslim prayer room before beginning their tour. Many had plans to fly to the resort island of Bali for a holiday after their trip to Jakarta.
""I thought it was an earthquake and I screamed when I saw many of my friends bleeding and covered with dust,"" said Betride Septiani, 21. ""We didn't feel any signs like the floor swaying or anything, it was all just so sudden.""
CCTV footage that was aired on television and spread widely on social media showed a floor shearing away in a few seconds under the group.
Septiani landed on her back one-story below but suffered only minor injuries. Other students fainted or suffered broken bones and concussion and are being treated in hospital.
COMBING THE SITE
A forensics police team was combing the site for clues about why the walkway collapsed and interviewing building management on Tuesday.
The complex was the target of a car bombing by Islamist militants in September 2000. Police have ruled out a bomb as a cause of Monday's collapse.
The second tower was reopened for business on Tuesday and authorities were aiming to reopen the tower where the incident happened on Wednesday. 
One expert said the preliminary report had ""reasonable conclusions"" and that such incidents can be difficult to predict.
""It may be because of degradation of materials over time and because of earthquakes, and to prevent that we would have to develop more foolproof materials and connections,"" said Davy Sukamta, head of the Indonesian society of civil and structural engineers. 

""If a building has a special construction like this, it must be inspected more regularly for wear and tear.""

1379,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 08:52AM ET</span>",EU still open to Britain changing mind on Brexit,"By Gilbert Reilhac
STRASBOURG (Reuters) - Leaders of the European Union institutions weighed into a new British debate on whether to hold a second referendum on Brexit by saying on Tuesday that Britons would be welcome to stay in the EU.
Prime Minister Theresa May and her main opponent Jeremy Corbyn have ruled out giving voters a chance to approve whatever withdrawal treaty is agreed with Brussels before Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019. However, campaigners on both sides of the debate have raised the issue again this month.
Updating the European Parliament on a summit he chaired last month at which EU leaders agreed to open talks with London on their post-Brexit future, European Council President Donald Tusk took the opportunity to support those calling for a rethink.
""Brexit will become a reality, with all its negative consequences, in March next year, unless there is a change of heart among our British friends,"" the former Polish premier said. ""We here on the continent haven't had a change of heart.
""Our hearts are still open to you.""
Picking up on Tusk's comment, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, whose executive arm is negotiating Britain's departure, added his endorsement: ""He said that our door is still open. I hope this is heard in London.""
Constitutional lawyers are divided on whether Britain can withdraw its two-year notice to quit but the exchanges underline a view in Brussels that an EU political consensus could be found to avert Brexit -- even if most are now resigned to Britain leaving and believe the Union will weather the disruption.
May's spokesman repeated her determination to follow through on Brexit, even though she campaigned against it in 2016.
In the debate, senior EU lawmakers called on her to offer more clarity on what she wants. Some mocked her, with the top German conservative skewering her announcement that she would restore Britain's old blue passports after Brexit as a ""scam"".
TOUGH TERMS
Member states are discussing among themselves a new set of negotiating instructions for Juncker's negotiator Michel Barnier ahead of the expected launch of talks on a post-Brexit transition period during which much of the status quo would be maintained.
Diplomats say those discussions reveal a firm line among the 27 on holding Britain to commitments to accepting continued obligations to the Union during the transition, including accepting continued free immigration from the EU and being subject to EU courts -- key complaints of Brexit supporters.
Work is continuing on how Britain might continue to take part in free trade agreements between the EU and other countries during the transition and on how and whether the transition might be extended beyond Dec. 31, 2020.
Among the most eye-catching of demands which diplomats have clarified is that EU citizens arriving in Britain even after Brexit, during the transition, would be entitled to retain for life the rights currently enjoyed by EU expatriates.
Senior lawmakers in the Strasbourg chamber were generally scathing about May's plans for Brexit. The leader of the center-right group, an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, mocked her announcement that British passports would go back to being blue after Brexit as opposed to the red used by most EU states.
""The whole story is a scam,"" said Manfred Weber, denouncing a ""lack of leadership"" and of ""honesty"" in portraying the move on passport color as a restoration of sovereignty. No EU law binds member states to red passports, and fellow member Croatia uses blue ones.
Guy Verhofstadt, the chamber's Brexit coordinator, called the passport saga ""hilarious"" and also derided May and her ministers for claiming credit for new laws curbing plastic bag use and credit card fees, when these were in fact EU legislation.

For the UK Independence Party, which campaigned for Brexit, David Coburn accused Barnier of trying to ""destroy Britain"" as a center for financial services by rejecting London's efforts to retain existing access to EU financial markets.

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Russian pollster pulls pre-election research over closure fears,"By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's only major independent pollster, the Levada Center, said on Tuesday it had stopped publishing polls about the forthcoming presidential election because it feared the authorities might shut it down for perceived meddling.
The move, which the Kremlin later endorsed as a necessary step to comply with the law, will reduce open source information about public sentiment ahead of the March 18 election which polls suggest incumbent Vladimir Putin, who is backed by state TV and the ruling party, will comfortably win.
Levada is regarded as one of Russia's three main pollsters and the only one not to be close to the authorities. But it was officially designated 'a foreign agent' in 2016 because of its funding, a move it and others said was designed to hobble it. 
Out of the other pollsters, VTsIOM is state-owned, while FOM, which broke away from VTsIOM in the 1990s, provides a lot of research for the Russian presidential administration.
Stepan Goncharov, a sociologist at Levada, told Reuters his organization had decided to suspend publishing pre-election polls because of its designation as ""a foreign agent.""
Lev Gudkov, director of Levada, was cited by the daily Vedomosti newspaper as saying it faced fines or even closure if accused of breaking the foreign agent law and engaging in politics.
""We are trying to understand our situation,"" said Goncharov, who said Levada would continue to conduct pre-election research, but not publish it ""for now"" pending consultations with lawyers.
Research might be published after the election, he said.
TURNOUT IN FOCUS
Whilst there is little suspense about the outcome of the March election, which Putin is seen as steamrolling, there is keen interest in voter turnout as media reports say the Kremlin wants to ensure Putin is re-elected on a turnout of around 70 percent as it sees high turnout as lending him greater legitimacy.
The question has become politicized because opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has been barred from running against Putin on what he says is a trumped up conviction, has launched a spoiler campaign aimed at lowering turnout. 
Levada, citing its own research, has previously said that as few as one third of Russians have said they will definitely vote, while state-owned VTsIOM has reported that 70 percent of Russians are certain to vote.
When asked about Levada's decision to stop publishing pre-election polls, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Levada had been left with little choice.
""Levada is a big organization that has authority, but unfortunately, based on the law, it is a (foreign) agent ...(and) will not be able to do this line of work,"" said Peskov.

The foreign agent law is designed to stop other countries interfering in Russian politics, something Putin has said foreign intelligence services are attempting.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa's Cape Town, one of the world's iconic tourist destinations, could run out of water by April as the city's worst drought in a century risks forcing residents to join queues for emergency rations.
""Day Zero"" - the date taps are due to run dry - has crept forward to April 22 as city authorities race to build desalination plants and drill underground boreholes.
Almost 2 million tourists flock to Cape Town every year to bathe on sandy white beaches, explore natural features like Table Mountain or to sip wine in dozens of nearby vineyards.
Travel and tourism accounted for an estimated 9 percent or 412 billion rand ($33 billion) of South Africa's economic output last year, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.
""At the current rate the city is likely to reach Day Zero on 22 April,"" said councilor Xanthea Limberg, Cape Town's mayoral committee member for water.
""There is a real risk that residents will have to line up.""
At a trial water collection site, similar to an estimated 200 the city may introduce, people line up between metal fences waiting to fill up containers from standpipes.
A maximum 25 litres of water will be provided per person, per day, officials said.
Limberg said the dire situation was being worsened by some people ignoring a push for residents and visitors to use no more than 87 litres of water per person per day.
Cape Town is home to many wealthy residents who have swimming pools and sprinkler systems, although the city does not want to play a ""blame game"" as lots of affluent residents are saving water, she said.
Businesses in the hospitality industry also say they are trying to help, limiting showers to two minutes and using water used for washing dishes and clothes to water gardens.
Authorities want to reduce the city's consumption to 500 million litres a day - half the amount used two years ago.
""Everyone is taking as many steps and measures that they possibly can to try and make sure we don't reach Day Zero,"" said Gabrielle Bolton, spokeswoman for the five-star Belmond Mount Nelson hotel.
In a possible sign of things to come, security guards have been monitoring a steady flow of cars and people lining up at AB-Inbev’s Newlands brewery to get up to 25 litres of free water from a mountain stream on its property.
The popular Newlands public swimming pool across the road from the brewery has been closed due to water restrictions with still two months of the South African summer left to run.
City officials say dam levels dipped below 30 percent in the first week of the new year, with only about 19.7 percent of that water considered usable. Residents will have to line up for water when dams reach 13.5 percent.
""I am concerned we will run out of water and it is difficult,"" said Susan Jones, a grandmother who regularly visits the Newlands spring taps.
""We are making do. We have to.""

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>","Ahead of UK summit, Macron visits migrants in port of Calais","By Marine Pennetier
CALAIS, France (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron visited a migrant reception center and quizzed refugees in Calais on Tuesday, taking stock of the pressure on the Channel port ahead of a summit with British Prime Minister Theresa May this week.
Calais and the surrounding Hauts-de-France region are among the poorest areas of France, with unemployment above the national average and public resources strained by an influx of migrants from Africa and the Middle East.
While the previous government bulldozed a vast tented camp, dubbed the ""jungle"" and once home to around 8,000 people on the outskirts of the town, in late 2016, several hundred asylum seekers, refugees and economic migrants remain in Calais and others continue to come, usually seeking to make it to Britain.
Interior minister Gerard Collomb, joining Macron for the visit, told locals the town would ""bounce back"" and not be known ""just for the issue of migrants and migration"". He promised more investment in reception centers and asylum processing, and emphasized numbers were being brought down.
""There were once seven or eight thousand migrants in Calais, but now we're talking about four hundred,"" he said. ""We need to have a balanced policy that combines reception and inspection.""
Macron will meet Britain's May in England on Thursday to discuss Brexit, migration and the Le Touquet accord, a 2003 treaty that effectively allows Britain to establish its border in France, and France to run its border checks in Britain. 
French officials believe the accord favors Britain and has contributed to the gathering of migrants to Calais, the closest point to the UK's shores. From Calais, many try to jump on trucks and trains going under the Channel into Britain, just 30 km (20 miles) away.
BORDER TALKS
At the meeting with May, Macron is expected to push for a new ""additional protocol"" to supplement the Le Touquet treaty that would involve Britain paying more to France for border security and accepting more asylum seekers. 
Britain says it already provides extra security to France. Pro-Brexit lawmakers from Britain's governing Conservative Party have dismissed suggestions London should pay more as ""absurd"".
If agreement cannot be reached, both Britain and France have the right to back out of the treaty, which would mean reverting to hard national borders. Such a move would reinforce the complete separation of Britain from Europe once the exit from the European Union comes into force in March 2019. 
Macron's government is drafting legislation to tighten immigration rules, in part a response to soaring asylum requests. Last year there were more than 100,000 applications, a record high.
While the president has been criticized for taking a tough line on migration, he sent a conciliatory message on Tuesday. Meeting migrants from Sudan who had reached France via Italy and Libya, he acknowledged the difficulty of their plight.
""We have a responsibility to protect those who are in danger,"" he was quoted as saying by BFMTV. ""(But) we can't welcome millions of people who live in peace in their countries.""

Yemen has been divided by nearly three years of civil war between the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, backed by Saudi Arabia, and the Iran-aligned Houthis.
The conflict has unleashed the world's worst humanitarian crisis, including one of the most deadly cholera epidemics in modern times and economic collapse, which has spread hunger.
Authorities sought to boost liquidity by printing money, but the rial plunged from 250 to the dollar to 350 after the first batch of newly printed notes was rolled out last year. The rial traded for 440 to the dollar by year's end and this week crashed to around 500.
""Government action in this regard is done on several tracks, according to the limited options available, including intensifying communication ... to expedite the completion of the Saudi depository procedures,"" state news agency Saba quoted government spokesman Rajeh Badi as saying on Monday.
Saudi officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the allegedly promised funds.
President Hadi announced on Nov. 11 that Riyadh had agreed to deposit $2 billion into Yemen's central bank to shore up the rial and secure shipments of badly needed fuel.
Hadi's government moved the central bank in 2016 from the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa to the southern port city of Aden, where the government is currently based. 
Both the central bank in Aden and the one in Sanaa suffer from depleted reserves, but they have played a key role in mitigating widespread economic pain by paying some public sector salaries, as soaring prices threaten to push basic commodities out of reach for many Yemenis. 
The Aden authorities accuse the Houthis of plundering the bank's foreign reserves to fund their war effort when it was based in the capital, charges the group and the Sanaa bank deny.

Several hundred demonstrators gathered on a street near the presidential palace, chanting slogans against rising prices and calling for a change of government before clashes broke out, a Reuters reporter said.
Protests and clashes with security forces broke out across the country early this month after Khartoum imposed tough economic measures in line with recommendations by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The African nation devalued its currency to 18 Sudanese pounds for one U.S. dollar, from a rate of 6.7 pounds in 2017. It also cut wheat subsidies, causing a quick doubling of bread prices.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan sees little chance of the oil spill from a stricken Iranian tanker that sank on Sunday in the East China Sea reaching its shores, an official at the nation's environment ministry said on Tuesday.
(Graphic: Burning Iranian tanker drifts to Japan - http://tmsnrt.rs/2DqMwH7)
The large tanker Sanchi (IMO:9356608) sank in the worst oil ship disaster in decades and produced a large oil slick, Chinese media and Japanese authorities said on Monday, as worries grew over damage to the marine ecosystem.
The vessel's crew of 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis are all believed to have perished in the incident.
""Oil spills in general can have a big environmental impact if they reach the coast, but we think that there is little chance of that happening on Japanese seashores for now,"" the official who helps oversee the marine environment for the ministry told Reuters by telephone. He declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media.
The tanker had been adrift and ablaze after crashing into the freighter CF Crystal (IMO:9497050) on Jan. 6. Strong winds pushed it away from the Chinese coast, where the incident happened, and into Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
The ship, which was carrying 136,000 tonnes or almost a million barrels of condensate - an ultra-light, highly flammable crude oil - sank after several explosions weakened the hull.
""From the area where the tanker sank, a sea current is heading to the north, limiting the chances of the oil slick reaching Japanese coasts,"" the ministry official said.
According to the Japan Coast Guard, the slick has narrowed and elongated. It is now meandering across an area about 27 km (16.8 miles) long and 15 km (9.3 miles) wide, with a width of between 300 metres and 800 metres, it said in a statement.
On Monday, the Coast Guard had said the oil had spread over an area about 13 km (8.1 miles) long and 11 km (6.8 miles) wide. 
(Infographic: Tanker blaze burns bright interactive - http://tmsnrt.rs/2DmrPvL)
A Coast Guard spokesman said patrol boats were cruising through the area to help diffuse the slick, adding that the ""spill area had shrunk from the previous day"", referring to the overall narrowing of the area covered by the slick.
Another spokesman at the Coast Guard said earlier on Tuesday that it was carefully monitoring the oil slick in case weather conditions changed the spill's direction.
Experts worry the sinking of the tanker Sanchi will likely expel the remaining condensate and the tanker's bunker fuel, or the heavy fuel oil that powers a ship's engines, contaminating the surrounding waters.
Bunker fuel is the dirtiest kind of oil, extremely toxic when spilled, though less explosive than condensate.
The Coast Guard has not identified the kind of oil in the slick, but it assumes the spill mostly contains condensate as some of the slick is diffusing and disappearing.

South Korea is north of the site where the tanker sank, but a coast guard official from the country played down the chances of the slick reaching the peninsula, noting it was about 600 km (373 miles) from Jeju Island, the nation's southernmost island.

On Sunday, the U.S.-led coalition said it was working with its Syrian militia allies, the mainly Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), to set up a force that would operate along the borders with Turkey and Iraq, as well as within Syria.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad responded by vowing to crush the new force and drive U.S. troops from Syria. Strong Syria ally Russia called the plans a plot to dismember Syria and place part of it under U.S. control, and Turkey described the force as a ""terror army.""
Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said such a force would raise tensions in Syria. Iran supports Assad in the nearly seven-year civil war against rebel forces and Islamic State militants, sending weapons and soldiers.
""The U.S. announcement of a new border force in Syria is an obvious interference in the internal affairs of this country,"" Qasemi was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.
Qasemi urged all U.S. forces to leave Syria immediately. 

The United States is at the head of an international coalition using air strikes and special forces troops to aid fighters on the ground battling Islamic State militants in Syria since 2014. It has about 2,000 troops on the ground in Syria.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A meeting of states that backed South Korea in the Korean war will look at ways to better implement sanctions to push North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons, officials said, even as the North and South explore detente ahead of next month's Winter Olympics.
Foreign ministers and senior officials from 20 nations will hold a full-day meeting in Vancouver on Tuesday, hosted by the United States and Canada, looking to increase diplomatic and financial pressure on North Korea to give up development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States, a program that has raised fears of a new war.
Canadian and U.S. officials say the meeting will discuss ways to ensure implementation of wide-ranging U.N. sanctions, including steps agreed last month to further limit Pyongyang's access to refined petroleum products, crude oil and industrial goods.
Brian Hook, the U.S. State Department's director of policy planning, said last week that participants, including U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, would probe how to boost maritime security around North Korea and options to interdict ships carrying prohibited goods in violation of sanctions.
The Vancouver meeting primarily groups nations that assisted South Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War, as well as South Korea and Japan. China and Russia, which backed the North in the war but have since agreed to U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang, will not be attending.
South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with the North because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.
TENSIONS EASING?
The meeting was announced after North Korea tested its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile in late November, but now comes amid signs that tensions on the Korean peninsula are easing, at least temporarily. 
North and South Korea held formal talks this month for the first time in two years and Pyongyang said it would send athletes across the border to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics to be held in South Korea next month.
China, North Korea's main ally and principal trading partner, has backed successive rounds of U.N. sanctions, but has also urged dialogue to solve the crisis. It has reacted angrily to the Vancouver meeting as an example of ""Cold War"" thinking.
China's state media said Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, stressed that a hard-earned alleviation of tensions must continue.
""Maintaining international unity on the issue is extremely important,"" Xi said. China was ready to work with the United States to resolve the issue in an appropriate way, state broadcaster CCTV quoted the Chinese leader as saying.
China's special envoy for North Korea Kong Xuanyou, speaking in an interview with Phoenix Television on Monday, urged the United States to seize the opportunity to seek direct talks with North Korea. 
China's state-run Global Times newspaper said the Vancouver meeting reflected Washington's desire to ""highlight its dominant role in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and cripple the clout of China and Russia.""
""But the meeting will likely accomplish little,"" it said in an editorial.
Diplomats say China's absence will limit what can be achieved, while North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has shown no sign of being willing to bow to pressure to give up weapons he sees as vital to his survival.
SANCTIONS 'GAPS'
The White House on Friday welcomed news that China's North Korea imports plunged in December to their lowest in dollar terms since at least the start of 2014, but President Donald Trump accused Beijing last month of allowing oil into North Korea, a charge Beijing denied.
Western European security sources told Reuters last month that Russian tankers had supplied fuel to North Korea on at least three occasions in recent months by transferring cargoes at sea. Russia says it observes U.N. sanctions. 
Eric Walsh, Canada's ambassador to South Korea, told a panel at the University of British Columbia that the uneven way sanctions were applied meant ""there are a lot of gaps.""
""One of the things we want to do is look at how we can improve enforcement,"" he said.
U.S. officials say hawks in the Trump administration remain pessimistic that the North-South contacts will lead anywhere.
Even so, debate within the U.S. administration over whether to give more active consideration to military options, such as a pre-emptive strike on a North Korean nuclear or missile site, has lost momentum ahead of the Olympics, the officials said.
Scott Snyder, director of the U.S.-Korea policy program at Washington's Council on Foreign Relations, said that if Pyongyang felt tougher sanctions constituted a blockade, it might interpret them as an act of war.
""If sanctions are going to be effective in achieving the objective of bringing about diplomacy, (they) have to be used not as a hammer but actually as a nutcracker or a scalpel,"" he told the university panel.
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who will be in Vancouver, said the international community had to stand united.

""Sanctions are biting but we need to maintain diplomatic pressure on Kim Jong Un's regime,"" he said in a statement.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 03:50AM ET</span>",Malaysia says it won't let politics derail Singapore train projects,"By Fathin Ungku
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore and Malaysia vowed on Tuesday to push ahead with two ambitious rail projects linking the two countries as Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak played down political uncertainty ahead of a general election to be held this year.
Najib and his Singapore counterpart, Lee Hsien Loong, were on hand as the two countries signed an agreement to build a Rapid Transit System across Singapore's northern edge, with a goal of completion by 2024. 
Thousands of Malaysians travel back and forth to tiny but rich Singapore for work and school, and the new transit system is designed to carry up to 10,000 passengers per hour in each direction - more than 30 times more than the existing train service can accommodate.
The two countries are also discussing a separate high-speed rail project, which analysts value at $17 billion - the biggest project undertaken by the Southeast Asian neighbors in recent years.
Singapore was part of Malaysia after the end of British colonial rule but they separated acrimoniously in 1965, clouding diplomatic and economic dealings for decades.
Najib, whose leadership has been mired in a multi-billion dollar corruption scandal at 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), is hoping to win a third term in a general election due by August, raising questions about the two rail projects. He has consistently denied wrongdoing.
""We cannot determine what the electorate will decide but we can offer our agenda for the people to decide,” Najib told reporters in Singapore when asked about the rail projects.
""We believe they will decide on an agenda that's very meaningful and productive.""
Lee expressed confidence that agreements would be honored by both countries. 
As the deadline to award the high-speed project nears, the two states must choose between competing bids from Chinese, Japanese, European and South Korean firms, a decision expected by the end of the year.
Malaysia leans toward China, which has pumped billions into Malaysia over the last two years as Najib looks to tackle massive government debt.
But Singapore's relationship with China has deteriorated over issues such as self-ruled Taiwan, which China considers its own, and disputed South China Sea islands.
The railway is scheduled to be completed by 2026 and will cut the travel time between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to about 90 minutes from the current four- to five-hour road journey.

The train journey from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur used to take about seven hours before the colonial-era Singapore station was closed in 2011 over sovereignty issues and the track in Singapore was pulled up.

1394,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 03:00AM ET</span>",Philippine lawmakers start talks for switch to federal system of government,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine lower house lawmakers on Tuesday kicked off discussions on possible changes to the 30-year-old constitution, with the aim of shifting to a system of federal government and allowing the president up to two terms in office.
The switch to a federal system was one of the key planks of President Rodrigo Duterte's election campaign, aimed to remedy what he saw as neglect by a Manila-centric political establishment that has left provinces in perpetual poverty.
Duterte's allies, who dominate the nearly 300-member house, want a constitution that broadly aims to expand both legislative chambers, lengthen lawmakers' terms, give provinces more fiscal autonomy, have a prime minister as head of government, and a separately elected president.
The tentative plan is to agree and draft the amendments late this year and hold a referendum in May 2019. 
Roger Mercado, head of the house panel on constitutional amendments, said lower house representatives were on track to vote and approve a resolution this week that would convene both chambers of Congress into a constitutional assembly. 
""Let's not waste people's money and time. Let us go ahead and convene already,"" Mercado told a hearing on Tuesday.
The alternative, of creating a special constitutional convention, would cost 11 billion pesos ($218 million), he added.
Senators are opposed to combining the two chambers to draft the amendments, which would make the normally powerful 24-seat upper house less relevant in the process. On Monday, Senator Panfilo Lacson launched a resolution urging the senate to convene a constituent assembly of its own. 
The push to change the constitution has been a divisive issue, with critics accusing lawmakers of trying to prolong their stay in office, or of creating a way for Duterte to stay in power beyond the end of his term in 2022.
Opponents warn the process could bring a repeat of the 1970s-era of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos and say they are troubled by Duterte's stated admiration for him, and the president's similar authoritarian traits.
The opposition says the 1987 constitution was drafted to stop that from happening.
Duterte has made clear he has no desire to stay longer than his term and, if anything, would prefer to retire earlier.
Lawmakers have yet to decide on what federal model to adopt, Mercado said. Duterte's preference is for one similar to that of France.

Television images showed flames ripping through the red-tiled roof of the whitewashed rectangular buildings. No casualties were reported.
""Most of the building...was on fire,"" the city fire department said on its website. 
""The Bahari Museum is being cooled down,"" it said on its official Twitter account. ""The cause of the fire is still unknown."" 
The buildings used to be warehouses owned by the Dutch East India Company and were used to store highly sought-after spices and other commodities like tea and coffee. 
In 1976, 31 years after Indonesia declared independence from the Dutch, the buildings were turned into a museum displaying nautical vessels, tools, maps and other items commemorating the fact that Indonesia is an archipelago of over 17,000 islands and that its territory is two-thirds water.
The Indonesian Heritage Society said it was too early to comment on the scale of damage and any restoration work. 
""It's certainly a great loss not only because of the contents of the museum but because of historic nature of the building and the whole Old Town area,"" said Isla Winarto, president of the organization.

""We hope the museum can be restored to its original glory in the not too distant future.""

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - A Canadian man suspected of a rare bank robbery in Singapore in 2016 faces a court appearance in Britain on Thursday after he was detained on a extradition request from Singapore.
David Roach allegedly stole S$30,000 (22,691) from a  Standard Chartered  bank (LON:STAN) branch in July 2016, before fleeing to Thailand where he was jailed for 14-months for failing to declare such a large amount of money when he arrived.
Singaporean authorities said they had repeatedly asked Bangkok to send Roach back to face charges in the city state, but Thailand decided to deport Roach to Canada last Thursday.
Later that day and apparently en route to Canada, British police said they detained Roach at London's Heathrow Airport.
""David Roach, 28, was arrested on Thursday, 11 January at Heathrow Airport by officers from the Metropolitan Police Extradition Unit following a request from authorities in Singapore,"" London police said in a statement late Monday.
Police said Roach appeared in court on Jan. 12 and was remanded into custody to appear again in court on Jan. 18.
Singapore's Attorney General's Chambers and the Ministry of Home Affairs said on Monday they had asked British authorities to arrest Roach and extradite him to face charges in Singapore.
Singapore, a former British colony, has an extradition treaty with Britain but not one with Thailand.
The robbery sparked a flurry of debate in Singapore about whether the country had grown too complacent about security.
Singapore has very low levels of crime, thanks in part to decades of strict policing and tough punishments, ranging from death for drug trafficking and murder, to prison and caning for lesser crimes.

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>",Pakistan clerics issue fatwa against 'un-Islamic' suicide bombings,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - More than 1,800 Pakistani Muslim clerics have issued an Islamic directive, or fatwa, forbidding suicide bombings, a book due to be unveiled by the government on Tuesday says.
The South Asian nation has for years been plagued by violence by Islamist militants who often use suicide bombers and preach that their struggle is a holy war to impose Islamic rule.
Suicide attacks are frequently condemned as fanatical and immoral, especially when civilians are killed, but insurgents view the tactic as their most effective weapon.
Seeking to curb ""terrorism"" that has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties since the early 2000s, the clerics declared suicide bombings to be forbidden, or ""haraam"".
""This Fatwa provides a strong base for the stability of a moderate Islamic society,"" Pakistan President Mamnoon Hussain wrote in the book.
""We can seek guidance from this Fatwa for building a national narrative in order to curb extremism in keeping with the golden principles of Islam.""
Foreign and domestic critics of Pakistan's government and military accuse them of cozying up to radical groups for political and military purposes and say the state has for too long turned a blind eye to hate preachers in mosques.
Pakistani officials deny frequent U.S. allegations about collaborating with militant Islamist proxies in Afghanistan and India, and say vast gains have been made over the past decade against militant outfits such as the Pakistani Taliban.
But privately they also warn any moves against some popular hardline groups based in Pakistan would take a long time and need to be undertaken carefully.
Similar fatwas appear to have yielded scant results in the Middle East where the practice is used by Islamic State and other militant groups.
The Pakistani scholars, who declared that ""no individual or group has the authority to declare and wage jihad (holy war)"", said suicide bombings violate key Islamic teachings and were as such forbidden.
The book was prepared by the state-run International Islamic University and Hussain was due at a ceremony to mark the book's release in Islamabad on Tuesday.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somali al Shabaab Islamist militants, who have carried out frequent bombings in the capital, Mogadishu, said a former leader who defected to the government side was an apostate who could be killed.
Al Shabaab fell out with its former spokesman and deputy leader, Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansur, in 2013. He defected to the U.N.-backed government in August last year.
Al Shabaab has been fighting for years to try to topple Somalia's central government and rule the Horn of Africa country according to its own interpretation of Islamic law.
""If Mukhtar Robow thinks he can destroy Islamic sharia and the mujahedeen, he is deluded. Allah will protect Islam and Jihad will not stop just because of you and your likes who joined the enemies,"" Ali Mohamud Rage, al Shabaab's spokesman, said in a video posted late on Monday.
It was not immediately possible to reach Robow for comment.
""No doubt, Mukhtar Robow left his religion and joined the disbelievers and the enemies are still the enemies,"" al shabaab's spokesman said.
""Anybody who joins the line of non-Muslims is an apostate who can be killed.""
A report by rights body Human Rights Watch released on Monday said al Shabaab had threatened and abducted civilians in Somalia’s Bay region to force communities to hand over their children for indoctrination and military training in recent months.
""Al Shabaab's ruthless recruitment campaign is taking rural children from their parents so they can serve this militant armed group,"" said Laetitia Bader, senior Africa researcher for the rights body.
The insurgents, who are allied with al Qaeda, were driven out of the capital Mogadishu in 2011. They have also since lost nearly all other territory they previously controlled after an offensive by Somali government troops and African Union-mandated AMISOM peacekeepers.

Al Shabaab, however, remains a formidable threat and has carried out bombings both in Mogadishu and other towns against military and civilian targets.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Philippines' Duterte had 'nothing to do' with news site's license: spokesman,"By Martin Petty and Karen Lema
MANILA (Reuters) - The office of Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte sought to distance itself on Tuesday from a regulator's decision to revoke the license of a prominent news site, rebuffing allegations the administration had initiated a crackdown on the media.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Duterte had not influenced the corporate regulator's decision against digital news outlet Rappler, and that Duterte had called him to ask why critics were pointing the finger at him.
Rappler, whose reporting has infuriated the volatile leader, was found by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to have violated restrictions on foreign ownership of domestic media. The decision is not final and Rappler, which has been allowed to continue operating as normal, said it would challenge it.
""He did not like the fact that Rappler was saying this is a result of the president's dislike for Rappler, of course not, he had nothing to do with this decision,"" Roque told a regular news briefing dominated by questions about Rappler.
""He was not even aware there was this decision coming up.""
Foreign press organizations and human rights groups have rallied behind Rappler, joining a chorus of domestic outrage among the media and political opposition at what they saw as move to muzzle those scrutinizing Duterte.
Amnesty International called it ""an alarming attempt to silence independent journalism"", describing Rappler as ""fearless in holding those in power to account"".
Human Rights Watch said the foreign ownership allegations ""masked a vendetta"" against Rappler and the decision ""suggests a sinister use of state regulatory processes to stifle critical media voices"".
During last year's annual address to the nation, Duterte singled out Rappler for being fully owned by Americans, which Rappler refutes.
The two U.S.-based organizations that have invested in Rappler are Omidyar Network, created by eBay founder and entrepreneur Pierre Omidyar, and North Base Media, which advocates independent media.
Rappler said its filings to the SEC in 2015 made it clear that just like several other media outlets, foreigners had invested in some of its Philippine Depositary Receipts (PDR), but did not own any shares, or have a say in operations.
FOREIGN POWER
Roque said earlier on Tuesday that by selling PDR to those entities, Rappler had given foreigners ""the power to negatively control the company"" without them holding any of its shares.
""Rappler in effect becomes a dummy of the foreign investor,"" he told news channel ANC. 
Rappler is the latest entity to have challenged Duterte and found itself subjected to legal scrutiny initiated by his political allies, usually after his repeated public outbursts against those questioning his policies.
His government has denied that his supporters are doing his bidding and the president himself has previously voiced disagreement with some action taken against his opponents.
Roque denied that it was Solicitor General Jose Calida, a close associate of Duterte, who had initiated the case against Rappler and said the regulator was already looking into its ownership before Calida took it up.
SEC Commission Secretary Armand Pan, however, said the case started with Calida's complaint.
Rappler's investigative reporting has included allegations that Duterte's government has ""weaponized"" social media, using it to discredit and generate online hate against critics and journalists. His office rejects that.
Roque said Duterte had no desire to crack down on media, though he did feel that Rappler was hypocritical.
""According to him, Rappler has been very active criticizing individuals for violating the constitution and the laws of the land and it turns out it is by itself violating the constitution,"" Roque said.
Rappler chief executive Maria Ressa disputed Roque's remarks and said a ""war of attrition"" was now underway.

""What's publicly stated is not what's going on behind the scenes,"" she told CNN Philippines.

1401,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 01:17AM ET</span>",Pope arrives in Chile to bolster battered Church credibility,"By Dave Sherwood and Philip Pullella
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Pope Francis arrived in Chile on Monday to start a trip aimed at bolstering the credibility of a local Church battered by a sexual abuse crisis.
Tens of thousands of people chanting ""Viva Papa Francisco"" lined the streets of his route from the airport, where he was greeted by President Michelle Bachelet, to the Vatican embassy, his official residence for three days before he moves on to Peru.
A youth orchestra played on the tarmac at an otherwise low-key arrival ceremony when the pope arrived from Rome on an unusually cool and cloudy austral summer evening.
Bachelet said on social media shortly after greeting Pope Francis that Chilean society was much changed since the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1987, during the dictatorship of the Augusto Pinochet.
""We are a society more just, more free, and more tolerant,"" she said, adding, however, that inequality still persisted.
Hundreds of people, many of them children waving Chilean and Vatican flags, greeted Francis outside the Vatican nunciature, or embassy, chanting ""Pope Francis, friend, Chile is with you.""
Despite the festive atmosphere, Francis faces protests from Catholics upset with his 2015 appointment of Bishop Juan Barros to head the small diocese of Osorno, a city south of the Chilean capital.
Barros has been accused of protecting his former mentor, Father Fernando Karadima, whom a Vatican investigation in 2011 found guilty of abusing teenage boys over many years. Karadima has denied the allegations and Barros said he was unaware of any wrongdoing.
That scandal, which has gripped Chile, and growing secularization, has hurt the Church.
A poll by Santiago-based think tank Latinobarometro this month showed that the number of Chileans calling themselves Catholics fell to 45 percent last year, from 74 percent in 1995. 
Francis may speak to it and other problems when he makes his first address on Tuesday morning to national authorities and the diplomatic corps.
He then heads to the capital's sprawling Parque O'Higgins, to say a Mass expected to attract more than 500,000 people.
While in Chile, Francis will likely also face protests from indigenous Mapuche who accuse the state and private companies of taking their ancestral land.
Bachelet last year asked for forgiveness from the Mapuche community for such “errors and horrors.” 
Francis flies south to Temuco in Chile’s Araucania region, home of the Mapuche, on Wednesday.
Several churches were attacked in the capital last week, including one with a homemade bomb where unidentified vandals left a pamphlet reading ""Pope Francis, the next bomb will be in your robe.""
No one was injured in the attacks and no one has claimed responsibility.
Shortly before the pontiff's arrival on Monday, a small group of protesters shut down a street in downtown Santiago, but were quickly dispersed by police.
Speaking to reporters aboard the papal plane on the 15-hour flight from Italy, Francis expressed concern about the danger of nuclear war, saying that the world now stood at ""the very limit.""
His comment came after Hawaii issued a false missile alert that provoked panic in the U.S. state and highlighted the risk of possible unintended nuclear war with North Korea.
Asked if he was worried about the possibility of nuclear war, Pope Francis said: ""I think we are at the very limit. I am really afraid of this. One accident is enough to precipitate things.""

He did not mention Hawaii or North Korea.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) recorded nine episodes of tremor, four of which accompanied lava fountains, and 75 lava collapse events as pressure builds up leading to lava flows and ash plumes, reiterating its warning that a hazardous eruption could happen any time.
Mount Mayon, a volcano in the coconut-growing central Bicol region that draws tourists because of its near-perfect cone shape, has shown increased restiveness since Saturday, displacing thousands of residents.
Phivolcs said the advancing lava and pyroclastic flows had reached the six-kilometer radius no-go zone, from which some residents fled.
""Alert level 3 remains in effect over Mayon Volcano, which means that it is currently in a relatively high level of unrest as magma is at the crater and hazardous eruption is possible within weeks or even days,"" it said.
Alert level 4 means an eruption is possible ""within days"" while level 5 is when a hazardous eruption is under way.
The Albay provincial government has expanded its class suspension order to include more towns around the 2,462-metre (8,077-foot) volcano, and advised travelers to avoid ashfall-hit villages amid poor road visibility.
Class suspensions have allowed the government to use schools as temporary shelters for displaced people.

Kim Min-ho, 42, was arrested after police found the bodies of his wife, Song Wha-jeong, 42, and son, Kim Tae-yun, on Sunday in a suite at the hotel which overlooks the financial center's Victoria Harbour.
Kim appeared in court wearing a dark blue jacket and hood. Slightly balding and wearing glasses, Kim stared blankly across the room as the two charges were read to him in Korean by an interpreter. He had been photographed earlier in hospital with his left hand bandaged and escorted by police officers.
When asked whether he understood the charges, he said, ""yes, I do"" quietly. 
A lawyer for Kim requested the case be adjourned till Jan. 30 to allow time to obtain psychiatric reports to see whether is fit to stand trial. He will remain in custody until then.

China has stepped up efforts to police how foreign businesses refer to parts of China, or territories claimed by Beijing, including Taiwan and Hong Kong - even if only in pull-down menus on websites.
""Due to an oversight, some Chinese territories were incorrectly listed as countries on parts of our website. We are correcting this error,"" said Qantas in an emailed statement.
China's civil aviation authority told foreign airlines to check their websites and make any needed changes, but the campaign goes beyond just airlines.
To comply, Qantas has now deleted several lists that categorized destinations by country.
China last week suspended Marriott International's Chinese website for a week to punish the world’s biggest hotel chain for listing Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as separate countries in a customer questionnaire.
A Qantas spokeswoman did not immediately respond to questions as to whether the airline expected a similar action by the Chinese authorities.
Public apologies from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Zara and  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) for similar offences have so far satisfied China, which has grown increasingly sensitive to issues of sovereignty.
Qantas is the first Australian company to respond to Beijing's heightened vigilance, though all firms exporting everything from iron ore to baby formula should be taking heed.
China, which is easily Australia's biggest trading partner, bought A$93 billion ($73.98 billion) worth of Australian goods and services last year.
Hong Kong and Macau are former European colonies that are now part of China but run largely autonomously. China annexed Tibet in 1950, although Beijing has long claimed the Himalayan region has been an indivisible part of China throughout history.
Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial issue. The ruling Communist Party considers the self-ruled, democratic island a wayward province and refuses to renounce the threat of force to bring it into the fold.
On Tuesday, Taiwan's foreign ministry said it had contacted relevant companies to comply with its own government's strict position on this issue, and to reject China's difficult and unilateral requests.
""We are closely watching the following developments,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Andrew H.C. Lee. 
""Of course, with the fact that Taiwan is a sovereign, independent country, there won't be any change to this as a result of China's unilateral way of handling things.""

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 11:40PM ET</span>",Veteran U.S. diplomat Richardson to work for Reuters reporters release,"(Reuters) - Former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson said on Monday he would work toward securing the release of two Reuters journalists arrested in Myanmar in his capacity as a member of an international advisory board on the crisis in Rakhine state.
Richardson said he was chosen by Myanmar’s leader Aung San Suu Kyi to sit on the 10-member board that will advise on how to implement recommendations of an earlier commission headed by former U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan regarding the situation in the state. 
Richardson told Reuters he would travel to Myanmar next week, along with the chairman of the advisory board, Surakiart Sathirathai, a former Thai foreign minister, who has also called for the journalists' release. He said he was seeking an appointment with Myanmar's Minister of Home Affairs.
""My objective, along with the chairman of the commission, is to get them out while we are there in Myanmar,"" Richardson said in a telephone interview.
Zaw Htay, a spokesman for the Myanmar government, was not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for Myanmar's home (interior) ministry said he was not aware of any appointment for Richardson.
According to U.N. estimates, about 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants in Rakhine. The Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, had been reporting on the crisis.
They were arrested on Dec 12 after they had been invited to meet police officers over dinner. Family members have said the two told them they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some documents by the officers they had gone to meet. 
Richardson, 70, was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and energy secretary in the administration of President Bill Clinton. 
In 1995, Richardson negotiated with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to secure the release of two Americans detained after straying over the border from Kuwait and he frequently acted as a go-between with Communist North Korea.
Myanmar prosecutors sought charges last week against Wa Lone, 31 and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, under the Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years, the reporters' lawyer said.

North Korea's pursuit of its military and nuclear programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council and other sanctions escalated tensions on the Korean peninsula in 2017, which have only eased in recent weeks.
Working on the scenario of a crisis that shuts South Korean airports, the Japanese government has begun to look into plans for evacuations through the southern port city of Busan, the Yomiuri daily said, quoting multiple government sources.
Japanese and U.S. military vessels would take Japanese and U.S. citizens from Busan to Japan's Tsushima island, roughly 50 km (30 miles) from Busan, before ferrying them to the southernmost main island of Kyushu a day or so later.
Government officials have already visited Tsushima to inspect hotels and other potential lodging facilities, as well as planning for stocks of food and water, the paper added.
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference on Tuesday that the government is always considering various scenarios and making plans for its citizens' safety, but declined to give details, citing security concerns.
""It's a totally natural duty as a nation to use every means at our disposal for the protection and evacuation of our citizens if they should face danger abroad,"" he added.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A prominent Chinese rights lawyer who wrote an open letter criticizing President Xi Jinping said on Monday that authorities had revoked his license to practice law.
Beijing-based lawyer and activist Yu Wensheng has repeatedly criticized the ruling Communist Party over a multi-year sweeping crackdown on rights lawyers and activists, which has seen hundreds detained and dozens arrested.
Chinese authorities briefly detained Yu in October after he wrote an open letter saying Xi was unsuited to lead China as he had strengthened ""totalitarian"" rule over the country.
Yu told Reuters on Monday that he believed the revoking of his legal license was part of reprisals for penning the open letter, but that it only made him more determined to persevere with his rights activism.
""It won't slow me down,"" he said. 
The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice told Yu in a letter that his license had been canceled because he had not been employed by a registered law firm for over six months, according to a picture of the letter seen by Reuters. 
A man who answered the telephone at the bureau said he was unfamiliar with the case and declined to make further enquiries.
A set of measures on the practice of Chinese law firms and lawyers was revised in late 2016 to include higher levels of scrutiny of the speech and conduct of lawyer, as well as greater requirements of political loyalty for firms and practitioners.
Rights groups say the revisions were aimed at preventing the legal community from taking on sensitive rights cases or speaking out against political prosecution of legal work.
Yu had also been involved in attempting to defend a fellow rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang, who was detained during a spate of lawyer detentions in July 2015. Authorities have blocked his attempts to meet Wang.
Wang, who has been detained for over 900 days, has been charged with subversion of state power. Wang's wife, who has protested on her husband's behalf, had asked Yu to defend him after rejecting court-appointed lawyers. 
Yu's wife Xu Yan said in a statement sent to Reuters that she and Yu had spent over 150,000 yuan attempting to set up an independent legal practice for Yu after he left his old firm last year.
""Now, the Beijing justice bureau says its not going to happen, so it's not going to happen,"" she said.

PERRY, Calif. (Reuters) - A California couple has been charged with torture after police rescued their 13 malnourished children from a home where some of them had been chained to beds, and neighbors on Monday described the family as shut-ins who shunned social contact.
Police made the discovery after a 17-year-old girl escaped the house in Perris, about 70 miles (113 km) east of Los Angeles, and used a cellular phone she had found in the house to call them, the Riverside County Sheriff's Office said on Monday.
""Deputies located what they believed to be 12 children inside the house, but were shocked to discover that seven of them were actually adults,"" police said in a statement. ""The victims appeared to be malnourished and very dirty.""
The children ranged in age from 2 to 29, police said.
The girl, who officers had initially thought was about 10 years old, contacted police on Sunday after escaping the one-story house.
The parents, David Allen Turpin, 57, and Louise Anna Turpin, 49, were arrested and each charged with nine counts of torture and 10 counts of child endangerment. They were ordered held on $9 million bail each.
Neighbors said the Turpins and their children rarely emerged from their unkempt home in the new built development of closely spaced single-family houses.
Wendy Martinez, a 41-year-old housewife, said her only contact with the Turpins came as she passed the house at night in October. Four children were installing sod in the yard while the mother watched from the door, and none responded when Martinez said hello.
""They were very, like, afraid,"" she said of the children. ""Like they had never seen people before.""
Police said six of the couple's children were minors, while the other seven were over 18.
The siblings told officers that they were starving and police did not give the parents' motive for holding the children captive.
A Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that appeared to have been created by the parents showed the couple dressed in wedding clothes, surrounded by 10 girls in matching purple plaid dresses and three male children in suits.
California state records list David Turpin as the principal of the Sandcastle Day School, with its address at the Turpin house.
Records show the Turpins filed for bankruptcy in 2011. Nancy Trahan, who works in the Temecula, California, law office that handled the bankruptcy, said the couple were friendly and spoke highly of their children.
""They seemed like very nice people,"" she said by telephone.

The Turpins are due in court on Thursday.

The so-called ""Blue Apple"" probe began three months ago, and is investigating alleged acts of corruption, money laundering and criminal association, Porcell told reporters, without naming any of the suspects. 
Porcell said the network, which included former officials, lawyers and members of the business class, sought bribes to cut through red tape in public infrastructure projects. 
The illicit money would be sent to an entity known as Blue Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Services that would launder the cash through banks, Porcell said. 
""This is another complicated corruption investigation,"" Porcell said. She said her team had so far recovered $20 million and confiscated $5 million dollars worth of assets. 
She added that various international arrest warrants had been issued for suspects who had fled the country. Panamanian authorities have also sought judicial assistance from the United States, China, the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong to recover some of the paper assets.
The alleged acts took place during the administration of Ricardo Martinelli, the country's president from 2009 to 2014, who was arrested in Miami in June 2017 on an extradition warrant from Panama. 
He was alleged to have tapped the phones of opposition politicians and is facing multiple investigations for corruption. Martin has denied the charges, calling them politically motivated.

Denmark last week deployed 200 troops to a UK-led NATO mission in Estonia aimed at deterring Russia from attacking the Baltic NATO members. 
Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014 and backs separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine in a war that has killed more than 10,000 people.
""Russia's behavior has created an unpredictable and unstable security environment in the Baltic Sea region,"" Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said at a joint news conference with Latvian Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis on Monday in Riga.
""When I received (Vladimir) Putin in Copenhagen during my first term as prime minister back in 2010, everybody thought that it would be the beginning of a new and much better and much more friendly cooperation between Europe and Russia. And that we could decrease our military spending,"" he said.
""But given the Russian aggression and what happened in Crimea, I think we simply have to be realistic about things and invest more in our security."" 
In 2016, Russia moved nuclear-capable Iskander-M missiles to its enclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea and deployed its S-400 air missile defense system there. 
In April last year, Denmark said Russia had hacked its defense computer network and gained access to employees' emails in 2015 and 2016.
Russia has accused the West of ""whipping up hysteria"" over its recent military exercises.
Denmark's center-right minority government needs to persuade parliament to back a proposed 20-percent hike of the defense budget over a five-year period. Rasmussen said he expected a ""very big majority"" to do so.
""We want to look at ourselves as a core NATO member. And in order to behave like such a member, we need to increase our expenditures,"" he said, adding that the Danish military needed a ""substantial increase"". 

""Five years ago we thought that the defense line, so to speak, would not be in Europe, but would be international operations. Now we realize that we need to have the capability to do both,"" he said.

1413,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 05:28PM ET</span>",At least 20 dead as clashes shut airport in Libyan capital,"By Ahmed Elumami and Aidan Lewis
TRIPOLI/TUNIS (Reuters) - Fierce clashes broke out in the Libyan capital Tripoli on Monday, killing at least 20 people, shutting the airport, and damaging planes during what the government said was a failed attempt to spring militants from a nearby prison.
The attack triggered the heaviest fighting in Tripoli for months, undercutting claims by the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) to have largely stabilised the city. The violence also undermines GNA efforts to persuade diplomatic missions to return there.
Automatic gunfire and artillery rounds could be heard from the city centre early in the day and authorities at Mitiga airport, which operates all civilian air traffic to and from the capital, said flights had been suspended until further notice.
The airport was empty in late afternoon, when the clashes had largely died down, though pilots flew several aircraft across the capital to the international airport - closed since 2014 due to damage from earlier fighting - in an effort to protect them.
A Reuters reporter saw one Airbus A319 operated by Afriqiyah Airways sitting in a hangar at Mitiga with a hole in its roof from artillery fire. 
At least four other aircraft suffered what appeared to be lesser damage from gunfire, including two jets operated by Libyan Wings and two Buraq Air Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737s that the airline said it was preparing to fly out of the country for maintenance.
The fighting pitted the Special Deterrence Force (Rada), one of Tripoli's most powerful armed groups, against a rival faction based in the city's Tajoura neighbourhood.
Rada acts as an anti-crime and anti-terrorism unit and controls Mitiga airport and a large prison next to it. It is aligned with the GNA and is occasionally targeted by rivals whose members it has arrested.
""ENDANGERED PASSENGERS""
Rada said the airport had been attacked by men loyal to a militia leader known as Bashir 'the Cow' and others it had been seeking following their escape from a prison it controls elsewhere in Tripoli.
The GNA said the attack had ""endangered the lives of passengers, affected aviation safety and terrorised residents"". 
""This assault was aimed at freeing terrorists from Daesh (Islamic State) and al Qaeda and other organisations,"" it said in a statement. The attack had been repelled, and an operation to secure the area was ongoing.
Rada posted pictures of streets around the airport, showing pick-up trucks mounted with guns, armoured vehicles and a tank.
At least 20 people were killed in the clashes and 60 wounded, including civilians, a health ministry official said. 
Mitiga is a military air base near the centre of Tripoli that began hosting civilian flights after the international airport was put out of service in 2014. In an adjacent prison, Rada says it is holding some 2,500 people, including Islamic State suspects.
Tripoli has been controlled by a patchwork of armed groups since a 2011 uprising that toppled long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi and led to the splintering of the country. There have been rival governments in Tripoli and the east since 2014, when most diplomatic missions evacuated to neighbouring Tunisia.
The Tripoli factions sometimes clash in turf battles or over killings or detentions of their members.
But there had been less open fighting in recent months after several groups including Rada aligned with the GNA, consolidated their control of large parts of the capital and ousted groups tied to a previous, Islamist-linked Tripoli government.

The United Nations is trying to pave the way for elections in Libya by the end of the year, which it hopes can help stabilise the oil-producing nation.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's Prime Minister Mihai Tudose resigned on Monday after his Social Democrat Party (PSD) withdrew backing for him in an overwhelming vote, becoming the second premier to be ousted in seven months.
Tensions between Tudose, appointed in June, and the party's powerful leader Liviu Dragnea erupted last week when the prime minister asked his interior minister, a close Dragnea ally, to quit, accusing her publicly of lying to him. She refused.
Monday's vote by the 67-member PSD executive committee is seen consolidating the grip on power exerted by Dragnea, who pushed out Tudose's predecessor Sorin Grindeanu in a no-confidence motion last summer.
Dragnea, whose party swept to an emphatic national election win in December 2016, is barred from becoming prime minister by a conviction in a vote-rigging case.
Tudose told reporters after the party vote: ""They named me, they removed me. I take responsibility for my deeds and I do not regret anything in my actions (as premier).""
He said he would confirm his resignation in writing to President Klaus Iohannis on Monday night.
Dragnea said 60 members of the committee had voted to sack Tudose and four to retain him, with the rest abstaining.
Independent political commentator Cristian Patrasconiu said that, while the day's events had strengthened Dragnea's position, ""it seems that it will be harder and harder to find a suitable and durable replacement (as premier)."" 
Deputy Prime Minister Paul Stanescu will be nominated to serve in Tudose's place for an interim period of up to 45 days, officials said. Iohannis can endorse Stanescu or propose an alternative.
The PSD, which has a comfortable parliamentary majority, will have to nominate a permanent replacement during that period and its nominee needs backing from Iohannis and will face a vote of confidence in parliament. 
Dragnea said the committee would meet on Tuesday to discuss proposals for a replacement.
""We want to avoid facing the same situation (replacement of a prime minister) for the third time,"" he told reporters.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's parliament on Monday passed a swathe of reforms demanded by international lenders in exchange for fresh bailout funds, a success for the government but a blow to thousands of people protesting outside. 
The bill introduces a new electronic process for foreclosures on overdue loans and arrears to the state, opens up closed professions, restructures family benefits and makes it harder to call a strike. 
About 20,000 people rallied outside parliament during the vote. Bus, subway and city rail services were disrupted and some flights were grounded as workers went on strike to protest against the bill. 
""Parliament shouldn't approve these measures. The government must take them back. They have exhausted us,"" said 55-year-old Georgia Koutsoukou, one of the demonstrators.
As the vote was in progress, police fired teargas to disperse protesters who hurled stones and petrol bombs at them. The unrest was brief.
The vote means the government has succeeded in securing the reforms before a Jan. 22 meeting of euro zone finance ministers, who are expected to assess if Greece has done enough to conclude the third review of its current, 86 billion-euro ($106 billion), programme that expires in August.
Concluding the review will help unlock about 6.5 billion euros in bailout loans.
""Today's vote is pivotal for the country to successfully emerge from bailouts in seven months,"" Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told parliament, urging his lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament to approve the bill.
The government's majority increased by one, to 154 seats, following the vote, after an independent deputy said she would join the ruling Syriza party's parliamentary group. 
But the legislation is a bitter pill to swallow for Tsipras' Syriza whose roots are in left-wing labour activism.

The new law raises the threshold to call a strike to just over 50 percent, from one-third previously. Business owners and Greece's creditors hope the measure will limit the frequency of strikes and improve productivity, which lags about 20 percent behind the European Union average.

In June, Trump had called on Qatar to stop funding groups that commit terrorism, saying the Gulf nation had historically done so ""at a very high level.""
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, who along with Qatar are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, plus non-GCC member Egypt cut off diplomatic, travel and trade ties with Qatar last year, accusing it of supporting militants and their arch-foe Iran.

""The leaders discussed areas in which the United States and Qatar can partner to bring more stability to the region, counter malign Iranian influence, and defeat terrorism,"" it said.

Qatar said the allegation, reported by the UAE's state news agency WAM, was intended to divert attention from what it said were violations by Emirati military aircraft of its airspace.
The UAE is one of four Arab countries, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, that imposed travel, diplomatic and trade sanctions on Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism. 
Qatar has denied the charges and accused the four countries of trying to make it conform to their foreign policy positions.
Qatar's rivals have banned Qatari aircraft from their airspace but Doha has not reciprocated with a ban of its own.
The UAE General Civil Aviation Authority said two Emirati airliners, carrying 277 passengers, had encountered the jets from Qatar, which lies between the UAE and Bahrain, while en route to Bahrain, according to WAM.
One of the planes was intercepted at 10:30 a.m., and the second at 11:05 a.m. at between 9,000 and 10,000 feet. The report did not specify a date, but appeared to mean the incidents happened on Monday.
""Bahraini radars have tracked the Qatari military planes while intercepting the Emirati civilian aircraft,"" WAM quoted civil aviation director Saif al-Suwaidi as saying.
""The incident could also be seen by the naked eye by both the crew and passengers, which constitutes a clear threat to the lives of innocent civilians,"" he added.
The UAE condemned the Qatari action as ""a serious and renewed breach of international conventions and the safety of civil aircraft traffic"".
The UAE Civil Aviation Authority did not say which airlines were involved, but Bahrain's state news agency BNA said the first flight was from Emirates [EMIRA.UL]. The airline is owned by the government of Dubai, one of seven emirates in the UAE federation. It gave no details of the second flight.
Qatar's foreign ministry said the UAE allegation followed incidents on Dec. 21 and Jan. 3 in which UAE military aircraft had violated its airspace.
Ministry spokeswoman Lulwa Rashed al-Khater said Qatar planned to take legal action against the UAE over the incidents.
""It seems that the Civil Aviation Authority in the UAE, by publishing false claims, is trying to pre-empt events and cover over news of the Emirati plane penetration of Qatari airspace,"" Khater said in the statement, posted on the ministry's website.
On Friday, Qatar said it had filed a complaint with the United Nations about the alleged violation of its airspace on Dec. 21. The UAE denied the allegation.

1418,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>","Openness or protection? Czechs' choice echoes EU, U.S. votes","By Jan Lopatka and Robert Muller
PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czechs, like fellow voters from Europe to the United States, must weigh promises of a more outward-looking society against protection from the uncertainties of the global economy and immigration when they elect their president later this month.
In the run-off on Jan. 26-27, academic Jiri Drahos will face incumbent political veteran Milos Zeman in a contest that echoes a string of elections in the past two years across the European Union as well as Donald Trump's battle with Hillary Clinton for the White House.
Zeman - a 73-year-old who has courted the far-right in rejecting migrants from Muslim countries while pursuing warmer relations with Russia and China - won the first round with 38.6 percent of the vote, results showed on Saturday.
However, Drahos finished a solid second on 26.6 percent with support from liberal voters attracted by his policies favoring EU integration. The 68-year-old has also won endorsement from most of the other candidates eliminated in the first round.
Czech presidents wield limited executive powers but from their office in Prague Castle they appoint prime ministers and represent the nation abroad. 
They can also influence public opinion at a time when Czech political, economic and social debate shows similarities to that in the United States, France and Austria as well as in fellow post-Communist neighbors Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. 
Czech voters, like others, are split between those who have benefited from European integration and those who fear the impact of globalization and cultural change.
Tomas Klvana, a professor at NYU in Prague, draws parallels between Zeman's voter appeal and the U.S. president's.
""The pattern is affected by domestic issues but this is similar to Trump, turning to the same voters,"" he told Reuters. ""On one side there are more successful, better educated, younger people not afraid of opening up, integrating economically... and (on the other) are people who are less successful, less educated, have lower income and live in smaller towns.""
Klvana also saw similarities between Zeman and two other central European leaders, right-wing Polish party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who have both picked fights with EU partners.
POLITICAL NOVICE
Drahos won the first round in the capital Prague, which has grown prosperous since the return to a free-market economy. Zeman won in all other regions, and performed particularly strongly in areas that have struggled since the fall of Communism in 1989. 
Drahos, a soft-spoken political novice and professor of chemistry, offers a direct contrast to Zeman, who has used expletives in live debates, relishes drinking and smokes heavily. In politics since the fall of Communism, Zeman also suffers from diabetes and has difficulty walking.
The clash is similar to Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen's fight against a far-right opponent in a 2016 presidential vote, Klvana said.
Beyond the region, French President Emmanuel Macron also offered a liberal vision when he beat far-right candidate Marine Le Pen last year. 
MIGRATION
Zeman has won votes with a tough stance on migration. The ethnically homogenous country of 10.6 million is united against accepting large number of refugees, even though few came in 2015 while hundreds of thousands arrived in neighboring Germany.
Like Zeman, Drahos opposes EU quotas that would force member states to share asylum seekers but he would accept a limited number seeking shelter if they met certain criteria. 
While Drahos lacks Zeman's charisma among some voters, opinion polls show fewer view the father of two daughters in a negative light than the incumbent.
Drahos, who comes from a small town on the Slovak border, joined the Czech Academy of Sciences in 1976 but missed out on promotion until the 1989 Velvet Revolution as he refused offers to join the ruling Communist Party.
The physical chemist, who plays the piano and has sung in a chamber choir for four decades, eventually chaired the academy from 2009-2017. 
SECOND ROUND MATHS
While Drahos trailed Zeman in the first round by 12 percentage points, he immediately won endorsements from five other candidates who collectively won 32.6 percent - making him a slight favorite at betting firms. 
""The aim of Zeman's team will be to discourage those voters who are not rock-solid from voting for Drahos,"" said Marek Vocel, a former campaign leader for Karel Schwarzenberg who lost to Zeman in the last election in 2013. ""Migration is a theme that moves almost everybody. I would expect that to feature in the debates."" 
Zeman has the backing of the Communists as well as the far-right anti-EU and anti-NATO SPD party. 
On social media and websites that often carry pro-Russian content, Drahos was accused on Monday of being a weakling who would threaten the country and give in to foreign interests.
Drahos brushed off allegations that he had informed for the Communist secret police, or worse. ""My adversaries are hoping that if they ram down people's throats that I was an StB collaborator or a pedophile, it will stick with someone. I know Milos Zeman will come with blows below the belt,"" he told daily Mlada fronta Dnes in an interview published on Monday.
Zeman has insisted since declaring his candidacy last March that he was not actively campaigning. But he has had a weekly show on a sympathetic TV channel and traveled the country to meet voters, while posters proclaiming ""Zeman Again"" hang around the country.
He refused to face his first round rivals on TV, but has agreed to a debate with Drahos for the run-off.
Drahos's biggest declared campaign donations are from self-made businessmen, electronics firm founder Dalibor Dedek and real estate developer Ludek Sekyra, and asset management office BPD Partners. Zeman's donations include 2 million Czech crowns ($96,000) from a firm owned by arms industry entrepreneur Jaroslav Strnad.
Former President Vaclav Klaus, who also holds pro-Russian and anti-EU views, has backed Zeman. After the first round, he thanked Zeman voters for ""not bowing to foreign interests"", migration and the related ""threat of liquidation of European and Czech culture, traditions and values"".

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea agreed during rare talks on Monday to send a 140-strong orchestra to perform during the Winter Olympics in South Korea next month, Seoul said, amid easing tensions after a months-long standoff over the North's weapons programs.
Officials from the two Koreas, technically still at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, met on the North side of the border truce village of Panmunjom to discuss North Korea sending performers - for the first time in 18 years - to the Olympics in Pyeongchang.
The two sides agreed that the orchestra would stage performances in the capital, Seoul, and at Gangneung, near Pyeongchang, the South's Unification Ministry said in a statement.
Lee Woo-sung, Seoul's chief negotiator, said the North had asked that the art troupe cross the border by foot via Panmunjom, located in the demilitarized zone where a North Korean soldier staged a daring defection to the South in November. 
The North will dispatch a preliminary inspection team ""at the earliest possible time"" to hammer out logistics such as the performance venue, stage conditions and the installation of equipment, according to a joint press release. 
The decision to host the orchestra ""contributes to improving relations and recovering the cultural homogeneity"" between the two Koreas, the South's ministry said. 
The two Koreas separately agreed to hold working talks on Wednesday on the North's athletes attending the Olympics, the ministry said. They will also hold talks hosted by the IOC on Saturday.
""The IOC will have no say on the art team. That is something that has to be discussed between the two sides,"" a North Korean diplomat in Geneva told Reuters.
North Korea is pursuing its missile and nuclear programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council and other sanctions and has frequently threatened to destroy the United States and its two key Asian allies, South Korea and Japan.
In bellicose exchanges in recent weeks, U.S. President Donald Trump has derided the North Korean leader as a ""maniac"" and referred to him as ""little rocket man"". Kim has responded by calling the U.S. president a ""mentally deranged U.S. dotard"".
But fears of war have eased after the first round of intra-Korean talks in more than two years last week, which Trump has welcomed.
Choi Moon-soon, governor for the Games' host province, said the two countries' orchestras may hold a joint concert.
The two Koreas last held a joint musical performance in August 2000 in Seoul amid upbeat cultural exchanges following the first inter-Korean summit two years earlier, a South Korean unification ministry told Reuters. 
The North's orchestra, called the Samjiyon Band, is the country's main art troupe along with the Moranbong Band, women who regularly stage musical performances and plays calling for loyalty to the leader, Kim Jong Un.
During the orchestra's New Year performance last year in Pyongyang, a large screen placed behind the staged displayed footage of the North's long-range missile launch and what it claimed was its first hydrogen bomb test in 2016, calling it a ""complete success"", a video clip posted by state media shows.
The North said during the talks it plans to play traditional folk songs which ""fit the mood for unification and are well known in both sides"", as well as classical music, Lee, the South's negotiator, told a news conference. 
""The choice of a symphony concert is to avoid any potential controversy because there are very few modern North Korean pop songs that don't carry a political message"", said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at the Sejong Institute think tank in South Korea. 
""As a standalone North Korean performance may breed criticism that the South set the stage for Pyongyang's propaganda, it would be desirable if the two teams perform by turns and then play together a popular song like Arirang for the finale,"" Cheong said, referring to a folk song shared by the two Koreas.

North Korea is planning to send a large delegation to the Olympics in addition to the athletes and orchestra. South Korea is also seeking to form a united women's ice hockey team with the North, according to media reports.

At least 83 people have been killed since the start of the new year in violence between the mainly Christian farmers and the semi-nomadic herders, who are mostly Muslims from Buhari's Fulani ethnic group.
The outbreak of violence, mostly in the central state of Benue, has become increasingly political ahead of elections in February 2019, with Buhari's opponents accusing him of failing to take action against the herdsmen.
""President Buhari said all those involved in the conflict that culminated in loss of lives would not escape justice, including any illegally armed militia in the state,"" said a statement released by Nigeria's presidency, after Buhari spoke to a delegation of Benue political leaders.
Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, is home to 250 ethnic groups, about evenly divided between Christians who mainly live in the south and Muslims who mainly live in the north. Central states such as Benue have often seen violence over religious, ancestral and cultural differences.
Farmers caught up in the clashes say herdsmen, who roam West Africa in search of pasture and often travel in and out of Nigeria through porous borders, are armed with guns and cutlasses. Groups representing herdsmen have also accused farmers of violent attacks in the last few years.
""I assure you that the police, the Department of State Service and other security agencies had been directed to ensure that all those behind the mayhem get punished,"" Buhari told the delegation, according to the statement. 
Those who attended the meeting in the capital, Abuja, included the Benue state governor, members of parliament and traditional rulers. Buhari, a former military ruler who was elected in 2015 after vowing to improve security, has not yet said whether he will seek a new term next year. 

Last week his spokesman said the suggestion that Buhari was not taking action regarding the herdsmen because of his ethnicity was ""disturbing"", adding that such clashes predated Buhari's administration.

The London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) said in a statement that the Court of Cassation's ruling was the last level of appeal in a case that began in mid-2016 when Rajab was arrested over tweets suggesting that security forces had tortured detainees in a prison.
""Today's decision ended the legal remedy of a long-running, unfair trial,"" BIRD said in a statement.
Rajab, a leading figure in pro-democracy protests that swept Bahrain in 2011, was convicted last year of making ""false or malicious"" statements about authorities in Bahrain. 
The charges arose from a January 2015 interview cited by the prosecution, in which he was alleged to have said that Bahrain was holding political prisoners who were subject to torture.
Amnesty International called Rajab's imprisonment ""a flagrant violation of human rights, and an alarming sign that the Bahraini authorities will go to any length to silence criticism"".
The U.N. human rights office last year called on Bahrain to ""unconditionally and immediately"" release Rajab.
BIRD said Rajab, who underwent surgery for a bleeding ulcer last year, faces up to 15 years in jail over a second hearing related to comments he is alleged to have made on Twitter. A verdict is expected on February 21.

Oskar Groening, known as the ""bookkeeper of Auschwitz"", was sentenced to four years in prison in 2015 for being an accessory to murder at Auschwitz. But he has not yet started his sentence due to a dispute about his health.
In December Germany's constitutional court ruled Groening must go to jail, rejecting arguments from his lawyers that imprisonment at his advanced age would violate his right to life.
Christian Lauenstein, spokesman for the justice ministry in the northern state of Lower Saxony where the 2015 trial took place, said Groening's plea for clemency had been passed on to public prosecutors.
He added: ""A plea for clemency does not have a delaying effect such as on starting the prison sentence.""
The public prosecutor's office was not immediately available to comment.
Groening's court battle was seen as one of the last major trials related to the Holocaust, during which some 6 million Jews were murdered by Adolf Hitler's regime.
Prosecutors said Groening - who did not kill anyone himself while working at Auschwitz - had helped support the regime responsible for mass murder by sorting bank notes seized from trainloads of arriving Jews.

Groening admitted he was morally guilty for the work he carried out at Auschwitz, which included sending bank notes he found in Jews' luggage to SS offices in Berlin, where they helped to fund the Nazi war effort.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda's leading lawyers sought on Monday to overturn a law that critics say would allow incumbent leader Yoweri Museveni to effectively become president for life.
The law, passed last month, scrapped a constitutional provision that limited the age of a presidential candidate to below 75 years. It clears the way for Museveni, 73, and president since 1986 to seek re-election in 2021 when the next polls are due.
Francis Gimara, president of Uganda Law Society (ULS), told Reuters the lawyers petitioned in court on Monday to nullify the law.
""The overall climate in which that bill was discussed and passed ... was wrong,"" Gimara said, citing a security raid on parliament and insufficient consultations with the people.
Many Ugandans including the political opposition, religious leaders and some members of Museveni's own ruling party opposed the proposal to change the constitution. 
Protests against the move erupted in different parts of the country prompting police to use teargas, beatings and detention to thwart them.
In September fist fights broke out in parliament for two consecutive days as lawmakers opposed to the measure tried to filibuster it. 
In a move widely condemned by rights groups, security personnel entered the debating chamber on the second day and forcibly removed some legislators after the speaker suspended them for involvement in the fighting.
Ugandan judges have made major anti-government rulings in the past but some critics say judicial independence has significantly eroded under Museveni's rule. 
""That court is full is full of cadre judges so I am not very optimistic,"" legislator John Baptist Nambeshe, referring to the country's constitutional court. 
Nambeshe is a member of the ruling party but he opposed the law. 
The phrase ""cadre judge"" is commonly used in Uganda to describe judicial officers seen as allied with the ruling party.
Museveni has drawn mounting criticism from local and international rights activists who view him as evolving into another African strongman unwilling to give up power in the prospective crude oil producer. 
The move to clear legal hurdles and extend his rule also mirrored similar maneuvers by other leaders in the region that have alarmed African democracy watchers. 

In Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Burundi efforts by leaders to hold onto power have triggered instability.

The Israeli military said it was checking reports of a Palestinian killed in a village near the West Bank city of Qalqilya, where it said scores of Palestinians threw rocks at soldiers who responded with riot dispersal means and live fire. 
Tensions in the region have risen since President Donald Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy on Dec. 6 by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Since then, there have been frequent clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces in the West Bank and along the Israel-Gaza border.
Palestinians want mostly Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. Israel took East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move internationally unrecognized. It sees the entire city as its eternal, indivisible capital. 
A total of 18 Palestinians and one Israeli have been killed in the flare-up since Trump's announcement, though analysts say neither Israel nor the Palestinians are interested in a major escalation.

Envoys of the two sides met in the Kurdish regional capital Erbil in northern Iraq and discussed major issues including security, control over the Kurdistan Regional Government's (KRG) land borders, airports, the oil industry, customs revenue and river dams, a statement from the Iraqi cabinet said.
""The meetings were held in an atmosphere of trust and understanding and concluded...by formulating a number recommendations"" to help resolve the issues, the statement added, giving no further details.
Conflict broke out after the KRG held a referendum on independence at the end of September, angering neighboring states including Turkey and Iran, with their own restive Kurdish minorities, and drawing rebukes from the Iraqi Kurds' key Western supporters, the United States and European Union. 
Under Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's orders, government forces responded to the referendum by dislodging Kurdish militia from disputed regions including the oil city of Kirkuk. 
Abadi also retaliated with a series of measures curtailing the KRG's autonomy, including a ban on direct international travel to the two main Kurdish airports.

BEIRUT/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan threatened on Monday to ""strangle"" a planned 30,000-strong U.S.-backed force in Syria ""before it's even born,"" as Washington's backing for Kurdish fighters drove a wedge into relations with one of its main Middle East allies.
The United States announced its support on Sunday for plans for a ""border force"" to defend territory held by U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led fighters in northern Syria.
The Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad responded on Monday by vowing to crush the new force and drive U.S. troops from the country. Assad's ally Russia called the plans a plot to dismember Syria and place part of it under U.S. control.
But the strongest denunciation came from Erdogan, who has presided as relations between the United States and its biggest Muslim ally within NATO have stretched to the breaking point.
""A country we call an ally is insisting on forming a terror army on our borders,"" Erdogan said of the United States in a speech in Ankara. ""What can that terror army target but Turkey?""
""Our mission is to strangle it before it's even born.""
Erdogan said Turkey had completed preparations for an operation in Kurdish-held territory in northern Syria.
The Kurdish-led regions in Syria say they need the border force to protect them against threats from Ankara and Damascus.
""To prevent any attack... there must be a deterrent force that protects the border between our areas and the others,"" Fawza Youssef, a senior Kurdish politician, told Reuters.
""Until a political settlement is reached in Syria, these areas need protection. Now, there aren't any guarantees,"" she said.
The United States has led an international coalition using air strikes and special forces troops to aid fighters on the ground battling Islamic State militants in Syria since 2014. It has about 2,000 troops on the ground in Syria.
The U.S. intervention has taken place on the periphery of a near seven-year civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million from their homes.
Islamic State was effectively defeated last year, but Washington says its troops are prepared to stay to make sure the Islamist militant group cannot return.
For much of the war, the United States and Turkey worked together, jointly supporting forces fighting against Assad's government. But a U.S. decision to back Kurdish fighters in northern Syria in recent years has enraged Ankara.
Meanwhile, the Assad government, backed by Russia and Iran, has made great strides over the past two years in defeating a range of opponents, restoring control over nearly all of Syria's main cities. It considers the continued U.S. presence a threat to its ambition to restore full control over the entire country.
On Sunday, the U.S.-led coalition said it was working with its militia allies, the mainly Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), to set up the new force to patrol the Turkish and Iraqi borders, as well as within Syria along the Euphrates River which separates SDF territory from that held by the government.
""DON'T FORCE US TO BURY""
Turkey views the Syrian Kurdish forces supported by the United States as allies of the PKK, a banned Kurdish group waging an insurgency in southern Turkey.
""This is what we have to say to all our allies: don't get in between us and terrorist organizations, or we will not be responsible for the unwanted consequences,"" Erdogan said.
""Don't force us to bury in the ground those who are with terrorists,"" he said. ""Our operations will continue until not a single terrorist remains along our borders, let alone 30,000.""
Syria's main Kurdish groups have emerged so far as one of the few winners in the Syrian war, working to entrench their autonomy over large parts of northern Syria. Washington opposes those autonomy plans even as it has backed the SDF.
The Syrian government and the main Kurdish parties have mostly avoided conflict during the civil war, as both sides focused on fighting other groups. But Assad's rhetoric toward the Kurds has turned increasingly hostile.
Damascus denounced the new border force as a ""blatant assault"" on its sovereignty, Syrian state media said. It said any Syrian who joined the force would be deemed ""a traitor"".
""What the American administration has done comes in the context of its destructive policy in the region to fragment countries ... and impede any solutions to the crises,"" state news agency SANA cited a foreign ministry source as saying.
Assad's allies have also chimed in. In an apparent reference to the force, senior Iranian official Ali Shamkhani said it was ""doomed to failure"", Fars news agency reported. 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: ""The actions that we see now show that the United States does not want to maintain the territorial integrity of Syria.""

""Fundamentally, this means the breakup of a large territory along the border with Turkey and Iraq,"" Lavrov said.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian culture and society risk being eradicated by Islam, Northern League leader Matteo Salvini, an ally of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, said on Monday as he vowed to halt a migrant ""invasion"".
His comments came after a prominent League politician faced widespread criticism for saying Italy's ""white race"" could be wiped out unless stronger measures were taken to stop mainly African migrants from entering the country.
Italy holds national elections on March 4 and immigration has become a major campaign issue, with center-right opposition parties accusing the center-left government of doing too little to stop the influx of newcomers.
""We have to decide if our ethnicity, if our white race, if our society continues to exist or if our society will be rubbed out,"" Attilio Fontana, the League candidate to become the next head of the wealthy Lombardy region, told Radio Padania.
Facing a barrage of condemnation for his comments, Fontana later said it had been a ""lapse"". But he received swift support from party leader, Salvini, whose popularity has risen strongly in recent years thanks to his anti-migrant stance.
""We are under attack. Our culture, society, traditions and way of life are at risk,"" he said in a statement.
""The color of one's skin has nothing to do with it, but the risk is very real. Centuries of history risk disappearing if Islamization, which up until now has been underestimated, gains the upper hand,"" Salvini added.
Salvini has pushed the League -- a regional power that at times has called for secession -- to the far-right of European politics, allying himself with the anti-Islam Freedom Party in the Netherlands and looking to tap into popular concern over mass migration.
More than 600,000 migrants have come to Italy from across the Mediterranean Sea over the past four years, fleeing war and poverty back home. 
However, Muslims only represent a small minority in Roman Catholic Italy, with the Pew Research Centre saying they will make up 4.9 percent of the population by 2020 against 3.7 percent in 2010.
All Italy's mainstream parties have called for tougher restrictions on migration and the government is working closely with Libyan authorities to try to thwart people smuggling. Last year migrant arrivals to Italy by sea fell by a third.
The head of the ruling Democratic Party, former prime minister Matteo Renzi, accused the League on Monday of scaremongering. ""We look to the future, not to fear,"" he said.
The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement said Fontana's comments showed the center-right bloc was extremist.

Opinion polls predict the center-right will win the most seats at the national vote, but will fall short of an absolute majority. Polls also suggest that Fontana will be elected as Lombardy president in a ballot also set for March 4.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey announced on Monday the route for a planned canal that would reduce shipping traffic on the busy Bosphorus Strait and transform the European half of Istanbul into an island.
Work on the 45-km (28-mile) Kanal Istanbul, linking the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara west of the Bosphorus, will begin this year, Transport Minister Ahmet Arslan said, adding it formed part of Turkey's most expensive construction project.
The Bosphorus is one of the world's busiest waterways with 42,000 vessels passing through in 2016 - compared with 16,800 that transited the Suez Canal in the same year.
It is the only maritime outlet to the oceans for Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Georgia, and for Russia's Black Sea ports. 
With urban projects on the canal's banks and logistical centers to be built in the Black Sea, Kanal Istanbul will be Turkey's most expensive project yet, Arslan said. 
Without specifying the exact cost, he added that the project would be funded through public and private partnerships.
The new canal would not be subject to the Montreux Conventions Regarding the Use of Straits which guarantees free passage to civilian vessels during peacetime, he said, meaning Turkey could charge vessels using it.
It will run from the Durusu region on Istanbul's Black Sea coast to Kucukcekmece Lake on the Sea of Marmara. Documents from Turkey's Environment Ministry showed the canal will be 25 meters (82 feet) deep and 250-1,000 meters (825-3,300 feet) wide, depending on where the docks are located.
""CRAZY PROJECT""
Kanal Istanbul will also be located near a number of projects in northern Istanbul spearheaded by President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party government, including the third bridge over the Bosphorus, which opened in 2016, and the city's third airport which is under construction.
The soil to be dug out for the canal project will be used for agriculture as well as for artificial islands and ports to be built in the Sea of Marmara, Arslan said.
The plan has many critics and Erdogan himself light-heartedly called it a ""crazy project"" when he first raised it in 2011. Environmentalists say it would pave the way for further development in the city's north, advancing the destruction of forests there.
A report evaluating the project's environmental impact, which is required by the government before construction commences, is currently being compiled, the Environment Ministry said.
Istanbul's Chamber of Geology Engineers said the initial filing for the environmental impact report did not take into account several factors that make the project unviable.
The project has the potential to severely impact the climate and balance of minerals and nutrients in the Black Sea and surrounding areas, and would deplete oxygen levels in the Sea of Marmara, it said.

Construction has been a key driver of the economy under the AK Party. The government's critics say the legal framework surrounding the construction sector has been repeatedly watered down, creating loopholes that developers can exploit for profit.

The U.S.-funded equipment will help replace four giant cranes disabled by coalition warplanes in an August 2015 raid that drastically slowed the unloading of food, medicine and fuel needed by a population riven with hunger and disease.
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said in a statement that a ship carrying the cranes it bought with funds from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) had arrived in Yemen’s Hodeidah Port and were expected to be operational immediately.
""With each of the mobile cranes able to handle up to 60 tons, they will significantly boost the discharge of humanitarian cargo and other relief items,"" the statement said.
The WFP said Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates facilitated the transfer of the cranes aboard the WFP-chartered vessel MV JUIST to Yemen.
The Arab coalition, under international pressure, eased a three-week blockade which was imposed on Yemeni ports and airports in November in response to a ballistic missile fired by the Houthis toward the Saudi capital Riyadh. 
Although the missile was shot down, the incident rattled the kingdom.
The cranes are expected to help ease a humanitarian crisis ravaging Yemen since its war began in 2015. Before the conflict, Hodeidah port handled around 70 percent of Yemen's imports, including critically-needed food and humanitarian supplies. 
The Norwegian Refugee Council said the 30-day extension, expiring on Jan. 19, was causing anxiety in Yemen and outside.
""What looked on paper to be a good policy for easing the blockade has done very little to lower prices of essential daily items like fuel and food,"" said Mutasim Hamdan, the NRC’s Yemen director. 
""The instability caused by the coalition's arbitrary policies, closing ports one day and reopening them on another, is making problems worse for the Yemeni population,"" he said.
He added that ""shipping companies, importers and vendors are left without assurance that the port will remain open, and this is serving to sustain inflation that makes food unaffordable for most Yemeni people.""  
The conflict, which intensified after the Iran-aligned Houthis marched toward the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile, has killed more than 10,000 people and crippled Yemen's economy.

The United Nations says that more than 22 million of Yemen's 25 million population need humanitarian assistance, including 11.3 million who are in acute need – an increase of more than one million people since March 2017.

QAMISHLI, Syria (Reuters) - Kurdish-led regions of Syria are looking to a new U.S.-backed border force to protect them in the face of growing threats from Turkey and Damascus, a senior Kurdish politician told Reuters. 
With a political solution to Syria's nearly seven-year-old war still out of reach, the risks for the country's Kurds and their Arab allies remain high, Fawza Youssef said. 
The U.S.-led coalition that has been fighting Islamic State in Syria since 2014 is building a new 30,000-strong border force with its Syrian militia allies in the north.
The move has been sharply opposed by Ankara, already angry at U.S. support for Kurdish forces in Syria, which it sees as an extension of Kurdish insurgents in southeastern Turkey.
The Syrian Kurdish YPG spearheads an alliance of militias which has battled Islamic State in northern and eastern Syria under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). 
With its inaugural class currently in training, the new force will guard the borders of SDF territory. 
It will deploy along the frontier with Turkey to the north and the Iraqi border to the southeast. The force will also stand guard along the Euphrates River Valley facing the Syrian military, which is supported by Russian air power and Iranian-backed militias. 
""There are threats from the Turkish state. The regime also more than once declared (it would) attack,"" said Youssef. 
""To prevent any attack ... there must be a deterrent force that protects the border between our areas and the others,"" she added. ""And we must protect the gains we have liberated."" 
Since the conflict began in 2011, the YPG and its allies have set up autonomous cantons in the north. Their sphere of influence expanded after they joined forces with the United States to fight Islamic State.
With Islamic State near collapse, Syrian Kurds have been working to entrench their authority in the north. 
The Syrian government has mostly avoided clashing with Kurdish fighters, but its rhetoric has grown hostile. While Kurdish leaders seek negotiations, the Syrian government and its Iranian allies have pledged to capture the SDF's territory. 
Damascus, which has accused the United States of illegal occupation and the SDF of treachery, vowed on Monday to end any U.S. presence in Syria. 
LEFT OUT
With help from Russia and Iran, President Bashar al-Assad's military has regained much of Syria from rebels and from Islamic State. The YPG and its allies now control the largest area of Syria outside government control. 
Even with the defeat of Islamic State, ""it appears the area will not easily be stabilized,"" said Youssef, a senior member of the authority running the Kurdish-controlled autonomous cantons in northern Syria. 
""Until a political settlement is reached in Syria, these areas need protection. Now, there aren't any guarantees,"" she said.
""These forces are Syrian and will protect Syrian land from aggressors,"" she said of the new border force, which will operate under SDF command. 
The United States says it has about 2,000 troops in Syria in the battle against Islamic State. Washington has said it is ready to stay in the country until it is certain of Islamic State's defeat, and until there is meaningful progress in failed U.N.-sponsored peace talks on ending the conflict.
Youssef said delegates from the U.S. State Department, whom she met in northern Syria last week, made it clear that U.S. forces would not leave before a political settlement. 
The American officials also said all of Syria's parties must take part in the diplomatic process, she said. Syrian Kurds have been left out of international peace talks for years, in line with Turkish wishes. 
On Monday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the United States was trying to create a ""terror army"" and pledged to crush the new force before it came into existence.
U.S. support for the YPG has put enormous strain on ties with NATO ally Turkey, which views growing Syrian Kurdish power as a threat to its national security. Ankara considers the YPG an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has waged a three-decade insurgency inside Turkey.
Youssef said U.S. military support would reinforce security in Kurdish-held territory, avert bombings, and prevent Islamic State from reinventing itself. 

""Daesh may be weakened militarily, but this does not mean it will completely end,"" she said, referring to Islamic State.

Alice Wells, principal deputy assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, met with Pakistani Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua, the Foreign Ministry and U.S. Embassy said.
A Foreign Ministry statement said Wells ""acknowledged Pakistan's efforts in eradicating terrorism"" and ""underlined the need for strengthening intelligence cooperation"" to fight terrorism.
Relations between United States and Pakistan were already tense when Trump tweeted on Jan. 1 that the United States had foolishly given Pakistan $33 billion in aid over 15 years and was rewarded with ""nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools"".
It is not clear what prompted Trump's tweet, which infuriated Pakistani officials and caught the rest of the U.S. administration off guard.
The United States has long complained that the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani networks that target American troops inside Afghanistan are allowed to take shelter on Pakistani soil. 
Pakistan denies this, and accuses the United States of ignoring its vast sacrifices - casualties have numbered in the tens of thousands - in fighting terrorism.
The Trump administration also last week announced the suspension of about $2 billion in security aid to Pakistan - officially a U.S. ally - over accusations that Islamabad is playing a double game in Afghanistan.

Mustafa Sejari, a senior official in Syria's mainstream rebel group, said the envoys described to U.S. officials the damaging impact of President Donald Trump's decision last year to stop equipping and training certain rebel groups.
Trump's move was driven by a wish to focus on fighting Islamic State militants and to improve relations with Russia, as well as a lack of results from the CIA's support of the FSA, U.S. officials suggested.
""We endorse President Trump's statements about the need to confront Iranian hegemony in the region. It is time to turn words into action. Until now on the ground it's the Iranian militias that are expanding without serious resistance,"" Sejari told Reuters by telephone from Washington.
""With every U.S. statement about the need to confront Iran's influence, Iran has been expanding in Syria while moderate forces that are backed by Washington see aid being dried up and are weakened,"" Sejari said.
""We asked for the resumption of aid and explained the dangers of leaving moderate FSA forces without support.""
Sejari said the delegation's meetings had included members of the U.S. Congress and officials from the White House, and they hoped for sessions with Defense Department and State Department officials as well.
IRANIAN PRESENCE IN FOCUS
The White House and Defense Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The FSA delegation, Sejari said, included recipients of the CIA-led program, which began in 2013 and funneled, via Jordan and Turkey, weapons, cash and trainers to vetted FSA groups fighting Syrian President Bashar al Assad.
Sejari said his delegation had briefed U.S. officials on Iran's ""destructive"" role in Syria, where Shi'ite Muslim militias led by Lebanon's Hezbollah have, along with Russian air power, have turned the tide of the conflict in Assad's favor. 
The FSA also says that Iranian Shi'ite militia fighting in Syria have stoked wider sectarian conflict in which mainly Sunni Muslims have been driven out of former opposition strongholds. 
""In all our talks with U.S. officials there was common ground, and on top of the matters discussed was the war on terrorism, (and) expelling Hezbollah and Iranian militias from Syria,"" Sejari said.
Another delegation member who requested anonymity told Reuters they told officials U.S. inaction in Syria would only allow Iran and its regional allies to recreate a land corridor linking Tehran, Baghdad, Damascus and Beirut - often termed the ""Shi'ite crescent"" by Iran's regional enemies.
The Syrian opposition said the previous U.S. administration of President Barack Obama had given ""Iran a free ride"" in Syria. 
FSA rebels have long complained that U.S. support has fallen well short of what they needed to make a decisive difference in the war against Assad's army and the Iran-backed militias helping it, including Lebanon's Hezbollah.
While cutting support to Syrian rebel groups that have fought Assad, the United States has deepened ties with a Kurdish-led militia alliance, the Syrian Democratic Forces, with which it partnered against Islamic State.
The SDF is spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, and has mostly avoided conflict with the Syrian government while seeking to entrench Kurdish autonomy over regions of northern Syria.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 10:28AM ET</span>",Four Pakistani soldiers killed in Indian fire across tense Kashmir frontier,"By Saad Sayeed
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan summoned India's deputy high commissioner in Islamabad on Monday after four Pakistani soldiers were killed in shelling by Indian forces in the disputed Kashmir region, the Pakistani foreign office said.
The latest clash between the nuclear-armed neighbors comes amid heated challenges and threats of armed conflict.
A decades-old dispute over the mostly Muslim Himalayan region of Kashmir, claimed in full but ruled in part by both Pakistan and India, has heated up after a 2003 ceasefire brought more than a decade of relative peace.
""Despite calls for restraint, India continues to indulge in ceasefire violations. In 2018, the Indian forces have carried out more than 100 ceasefire violations,"" the foreign office said, after summoning deputy high commissioner J.P. Singh. 
Pakistan's military earlier said that troops carrying out maintenance work were fired upon by Indian forces, adding that Pakistani forces responded, killing three Indian soldiers and wounding several others.
India's military told Reuters that Pakistani forces fired first and no casualties were recorded on the Indian side.
On another section of the so-called Line of Control dividing Kashmir between the two sides, India said its forces on Monday killed five members of a pro-Pakistan militant group trying to slip into Indian Kashmir.
A Pakistani military source, who declined to be identified, denied that any militants had been killed trying to cross from the Pakistani side to the Indian side.
India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamist militants and encouraging them to launch attacks in Indian-controlled Kashmir, where a separatist insurgency has simmered for years, and in other parts of India.
Pakistan denies that and says India must hold negotiations on the future of Kashmir.
The neighbors have fought three wars since their independence from Britain, two of them over Kashmir.
Artillery exchanges across the LoC were common for years before the 2003 ceasefire in Kashmir largely brought an end to violence but clashes have been increasing over the past couple of years.
Relations have been particularly tense since India said it carried out cross-border surgical strikes against militants hiding in Pakistan in 2016. Pakistan said Indian forces never crossed onto its territory.
On Friday, Indian army chief General Bipin Rawat said his forces were willing to carry out operations inside Pakistan despite the risk of a nuclear conflict, the Indian daily the Hindustan Times reported. 
The comment drew derision from Pakistan's foreign minister who termed the statement ""irresponsible"" and an ""invitation for nuclear encounter"". 
Pakistan's military has said 52 civilians were killed and 254 wounded by Indian shelling in the region last year, more than in all of the previous 14 years combined.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 10:23AM ET</span>",German establishment woos SPD activists to back coalition talks,"By Thomas Escritt and Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) - Senior politicians from Germany's conservatives and Social Democrats (SPD) sought on Monday to shore up support for a deal on forming a coalition, after members of the center-left party voted against it in one region.
With many among the SPD's rank-and-file opposed to teaming up again with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, the party's national representatives will decide at a congress on Sunday whether to open formal talks on renewing the 'grand coalition' that governed Germany from 2013 to 2017.
SPD leader Martin Schulz is due in Dortmund on Monday to appeal for backing from members in North Rhine-Westphalia, which will contribute more than a quarter of the votes to the congress.
Many of the SPD's grassroots supporters say the coalition blueprint it agreed last week with Merkel's CDU/CSU alliance reflects too few of their party's aims and that it should reinvent itself in opposition.
In remarks seemingly intended to appease opponents of the deal, NRW's conservative state premier Armin Laschet said on Monday that the blueprint would be further refined .
But that concession seems unlikely to win over SPD activists in the state, who say the preliminary deal makes too many concessions, containing no pledges to raise taxes on top earners or abolish Germany's dual public-private health insurance system in favor of a single ""citizen's insurance"".
If Schulz fails to persuade them, the talks could collapse, deepening the mood of political uncertainty that has gripped Europe's largest economy and key power-broker since an earlier attempt by Merkel to form a three-way coalition with two smaller parties collapsed in November.
Schulz defended the draft, telling the RND newspaper network: ""We pushed through a long list of points which will really improve people's lives."" While the party had not got 
everything it wanted, ""what we did push through justifies starting coalition negotiations.""
'ENDLESS NEGOTIATION'
In inconclusive national elections in September, the conservatives lost votes to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
But the SPD performed even worse, notching up its worst result since the foundation of the Federal Republic in 1949. Opponents of the deal within the party say it would suffer even bigger losses in the next national election if it renewed the coalition.
On Saturday, youth activists rallied the SPD in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt into voting against a deal.. 
As a sweetener, senior SPD member Wolfgang Tiefensee suggested the party could demand a clause in any final coalition agreement that committed Merkel to calling a vote of confidence two years into the next government's four-year term.
""Should everything work fine we will continue,"" said Tiefensee, economy minister in the state of Thuringia. ""If not, there will be a new election."" 
Even if SPD delegates approve formal talks, a fourth term for Merkel is not guaranteed. Schulz has promised to put the terms of any deal to a vote by the 443,000 SPD members.
In trying to sell the deal, Schulz can point to lower taxes for low-income households who had traditionally formed the backbone of the party's support base.
While opposing calls from SPD activists for the blueprint to be revised, NRW premier Laschet said it would be ""refined and expanded"" during the formal negotiations. ""Ordinary people are saying: 'Just form a government, stop this endless negotiation.'""
But any softening of conditions is likely to meet opposition from the Christian Social Union (CSU), the arch-conservative Bavarian sister party of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU).

""I can't imagine that we will substantially change the agreement reached in exploratory talks,"" said CSU leader Horst Seehofer, dismissing the demands of a ""worked-up"" SPD.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 10:23AM ET</span>","London attacker took steroids before deadly rampage, inquest told","LONDON (Reuters) - The man who mowed down pedestrians on London's Westminster Bridge before killing a police officer outside Britain's parliament last year had taken steroids beforehand, a London court heard on Monday. 
Last March Khalid Masood, 52, killed four people on the bridge before, armed with two carving knives, he stabbed to death an unarmed police officer in the grounds of parliament. He was shot dead at the scene.
It was the first of five attacks on Britain last year which police blamed on terrorism.
A submission to a pre-inquest hearing into the fatalities at London's Old Bailey Court said there was evidence that Masood had taken anabolic steroids in the hours or days before his death.
""A more specialist pharmaceutical toxicologist ... has been instructed to prepare a report addressing how steroid use may have affected Khalid Masood,"" the submission by the inquiry's lawyer Jonathan Hough said. 
The hearing also heard from Gareth Patterson, a lawyer representing relatives of four of the victims, who lambasted tech firms over their stance on encryption and failing to remove radicalizing material from websites. 
Patterson said families wanted answers about how Masood, who was known to the UK security service MI5, was radicalized and why shortly before his attack, he was able to share an extremist document via WhatsApp. 
He said victims' relatives could not understand ""why it is that radicalizing material continues to be freely available on the internet"".
""We do not understand why it's necessary for WhatsApp, Telegram and these sort of media applications to have end-to-end encryption,"" he told the hearing at London's Old Bailey court.
Patterson told Reuters following the hearing that he was ""fed up"" of prosecuting terrorism cases which featured encryption and particularly the WhatsApp messaging service.
""How many times do we have to have this?"" he said. 
The British government has been pressurizing companies to do more to remove extremist content and rein in encryption which they say allows terrorists and criminals to communicate without being monitored by police and spies, while also making it hard for the authorities to track them down.
However, it has met quiet resistance from tech leaders like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Twitter and critics say ending encryption will weaken security for legitimate actions and open a back door for government snooping.
Samantha Leek, the British government's lawyer, said the issues over encryption and radicalization were a matter of public policy and too wide for an inquest to consider. 
Police say Masood had planned and carried out his attack alone, despite claims of responsibility from Islamic State, although a report in December confirmed he was known to MI5 for associating with extremists, particularly between 2010 and 2012, but not considered a threat.

Coroner Mark Lucraft said the inquest, which will begin in September, would seek to answer ""obvious and understandable questions"" the families might have.

The authorities destroyed 928 kg (more than 2,040 lbs) of the drug, the largest cocaine haul in Asia, which was found in a container of timber on a Colombian ship bound for India in December 2016, and represented part of more than 1,700 kg of drugs seized in the past three years. 
The drug haul was destroyed under a special facility in a cement factory closed to the country’s main airport.
""We are very serious about the zero tolerance  policy on this ... we have a long way to go,"" said Minister of Law and Order Sagala Ratnayaka attending the event.
""Sri Lanka is being used as a transit hub. This haul would have been for transit purposes and some parts of it come into Sri Lanka. There is a distribution process and we are tracking the network and the peddlers.""
Through August last year, Sri Lankan customs seized six shipments of high-quality South American cocaine in 14 months, including Asia's largest-ever haul of the drug in December 2016, at its main port.
On that occasion, about 1,770 kg of cocaine, with a value of $140 million, was seized, of which 840 kg was found in sugar shipments from Brazil.
Senior police officials have told Reuters some gangs are seeking to mask their shipments to Australian and European markets by bringing them into Sri Lanka, then sending them on in Sri Lankan containers.

1440,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>","Ethiopia to free opposition leader, others jailed for involvement in unrest","By Aaron Maasho
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopian authorities have dropped charges against a senior opposition leader and hundreds of others who had been jailed for involvement in unrest that gripped the country in 2015 and 2016, the country's attorney general said on Monday.
Hundreds have been killed in violence in the Horn of Africa country since protests first erupted in its central Oromiya province over allegations of land grabs.
Several dissident politicians have since been jailed having been charged with involvement in terrorism and collusion with the secessionist Oromo Liberation Front, which the government has branded a terrorist group.
Facing mounting unrest, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn announced earlier this month that jailed politicians would be released and those facing trial would have their cases dismissed in a bid to foster reconciliation.
On Monday, Attorney General Getachew Ambaye told journalists that 528 people had so far been selected for clemency, including Merera Gudina - leader of the opposition group Oromo Federalist Congress who was arrested in late 2015.
Getachew said criteria for their selection involved taking into account proof that the suspects did not take part in actions that led to killings and severe injury, damaging infrastructure, and ""conspiracy to dismantle the constitutional order by force"".
""All 528 will be released within two months,"" he said.
Merera was arrested after a trip to Brussels to meet members of the European Parliament, and formally charged with attempting to ""dismantle or disrupt social, economic and political activity"". 
He was also accused of backing a secessionist group Addis Ababa labels a terrorist movement, as well as flouting guidelines on a state of emergency that was imposed for nine months during his trip to Belgium.
Nearly 700 people died in one bout of unrest during months of protests in 2015 and 2016, according to a parliament-mandated investigation.
Rallies over land rights broadened into demonstrations over political restrictions and perceived rights abuses, before spreading into the northern Amhara region and - to a smaller extent - in its SNNP province in the south.
In recent months, a spate of ethnic clashes have also taken place. Dozens of people were killed in several bouts of violence between ethnic Oromos and Somalis in the Oromiya region last year.
Hailemariam made his announcement after the ruling EPRDF coalition concluded a weeks-long meeting meant to thrash out policies to address grievances.
The unrest had triggered growing friction within the party. Some high-ranking members had subsequently submitted their resignation, while officials have openly squabbled with each other over the cause of clashes.
Getachew said more pardons and releases are set to follow.
Ethiopia, sandwiched between volatile Somalia and Sudan, is often accused by rights groups of using security concerns as an excuse to stifle dissent and media freedoms. It denies the charge.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India and Israel will begin work on a free trade pact that Israel has been pushing for, officials said on Monday, as Benjamin Netanyahu began a first visit by an Israeli prime minister in 15 years. 
India and Israel have built close ties over the years, largely centered on arms purchases, away from the public eye. But under Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose nationalist party has long admired Israel for its tough approach to terrorism, ties have flowered across the economy.
""We have had diplomatic relations for 25 years, but something different is happening now,"" Netanyahu said soon after the two sides signed nine agreements covering cooperation in cyber security, space and oil and gas exploration.
Israel has given initial approval for Indian energy companies to explore oil and gas in the eastern Mediterranean, in the first such move by Indian firms in that region.
Netanyahu, who said he saw a ""kindred spirit"" in Modi in terms of getting things done, pushed for a free trade pact with Asia's third largest economy during the talks on Monday. 
Modi agreed to open trade discussions, Indian foreign ministry secretary in charge of economic relations Vijay Gokhale told reporters. ""A delegation from the commerce ministry will actually go next month for discussions on trade,"" he said.
Bilateral trade has jumped from $200 million in 1992, when the two countries opened diplomatic relations, to $4.16 billion in 2016, largely in favor of Israel. 
Netanyahu, accompanied by a 130-member delegation, wants to increase exports to India by 25 percent over the three years. 
Israel has emerged as one of India's biggest suppliers of weapons alongside the United States and long-term partner Russia. 
But the two sides were tightlipped over the fate of a $500 million deal to buy anti-tank missiles from Israel's state-owned defense contractor Rafael that India called off just weeks before Netanyahu's first.
The Indian government wanted to support a local program to build the missile but Israel has since pushed hard to revive the order. It has offered to transfer technology and eventually build the missile with a local partner in a boost for Modi's signature Make-in-India drive for a domestic defense base.
Without referring to the anti-tank missile deal, Modi said he had invited Israeli companies to take advantage of India's liberalised rules in the defense sector to ""make more in India with our companies.""
Last year, Modi made a first trip to Israel by an Indian prime minister ever.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 09:11AM ET</span>",Venezuelan rogue police pilot says he is wounded as authorities close in,"By Alexandra Ulmer and Andreina Aponte
CARACAS (Reuters) - - Self-identified rogue helicopter pilot Oscar Perez appeared with a bloody face in a series of Instagram videos on Monday, saying that he was surrounded by authorities who were shooting at him in a poor neighborhood outside Caracas. 
Perez, a former police pilot, is wanted for using a stolen helicopter to lob grenades and shoot at government buildings in June as well as for breaking into a National Guard unit in December to steal weapons. 
President Nicolas Maduro's leftist government has described him as a ""fanatic, extremist terrorist"" and a manhunt has been under way for months. Some critics of Maduro have questioned whether his attacks were staged in cahoots with the government to justify a further crackdown on the opposition.
Authorities appeared to finally track him down in the poor hillside neighborhood of El Junquito. In a dozen dramatic videos posted on Instagram, Perez said authorities were firing at him with grenade launchers and snipers were outside.
""We're wounded... they're killing us!"" said Perez, seemingly wearing a bulletproof vest, as he crouched down in what appeared to be a small house and gunshots were heard in the background. 
""Venezuela, don't lose hope... Now only you have power so that we can all be free,"" he said in an earlier video, staring into the camera and telling his children he loves them and hopes to see them again. 
'CAUGHT LIKE A RAT' 
The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, some members of Maduro's government scoffed at Perez on Monday morning. 
""What a coward now that he's caught like a rat!"" tweeted Prisons Minister Iris Varela. ""Where is the courage he had to attack military units, kill and injure officials and steal weapons?"" 
An action film star who portrays himself as a James Bond or Rambo-like figure on social media, Perez has added surreal twists to Venezuela's long-running political drama.
He rose to fame in June after allegedly hijacking a police helicopter, flying over Caracas' center and firing shots at and lobbing grenades on the Interior Ministry and the Supreme Court.
Perez claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was to fight what he said was a tyrannical government. 
He went into hiding afterward, only to pop up two weeks later at an opposition vigil for anti-government protesters killed during demonstrations that rocked the country last year.
Then in December, a video posted on Perez's YouTube account shows armed, masked men taking control of military barracks under cover of night. 

They smash photos of Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, handcuff around a dozen soldiers and berate them for supporting ""dictatorship"" in Venezuela. Perez says his team stole around 26 AK-103's and over 3,000 munitions for the rifles, as well as pistols.

1443,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>",IMF concerned by Ukraine's new anti-corruption draft law - paper,"KIEV (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund has told the Ukrainian authorities that it does not support a draft law to create an anti-corruption court because the bill does not guarantee its independence, the newspaper Ukrainska Pravda reported on Monday.
Slow progress in establishing a court to handle corruption cases while demonstrating independence and transparency has been one of the main obstacles to the disbursement of a long-delayed loan tranche under the aid-for-reforms program.
In response to international pressure to speed up the process, President Petro Poroshenko submitted a new draft law to parliament in December.
But the IMF mission chief for Ukraine, Ron van Rooden, has since written to the presidential administration to express the Fund's concerns about parts of the bill, Ukrainska Pravda said, publishing what it said was the text of the letter in full.
""We have serious concerns about the draft law,"" van Rooden said in the letter dated Jan. 11. ""Several provisions are not consistent with the authorities' commitments under Ukraine's IMF-supported program.""
He said parts of the legislation could undermine the independence of the court and the transparent appointment of competent and trustworthy judges.
The law could also lead to further delays as an additional bill would need to be submitted by the president for the court to established, he said.
""In its current form ... we would not be able to support the draft law,"" he said.
Responding to a request for comment, Poroshenko's office denied an allegation in the letter that the law is not in line with recommendations of a leading European rights watchdog.
""President Petro Poroshenko has repeatedly emphasized that the country's leadership has the political will to create an independent anti-corruption court,"" it said in an emailed statement.
The IMF did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The IMF and Ukraine's other foreign backers have repeatedly called for Ukraine to improve efforts to root out graft. They see an anti-corruption court as an essential tool for eliminating the power of vested interests.
Reform progress stalled last year, raising concerns the authorities are backtracking on commitments and unpopular policy changes in anticipation of presidential and parliamentary elections in 2019.

Establishing the court, sticking to gas price adjustments and implementing sustainable pension reform are the key conditions Ukraine must meet to qualify for the next loan tranche of around $2 billion from the IMF.

ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (Reuters) - Pope Francis said on Monday he was really afraid about the danger of nuclear war and that the world now stood at ""the very limit"".
His comment, made as he flew off for a visit to Chile and Peru, came after Hawaii issued a false missile alert that provoked panic in the U.S. state and highlighted the risk of possible unintended nuclear war with North Korea.
Asked if he was worried about the possibility of nuclear war, Pope Francis said: ""I think we are at the very limit. I am really afraid of this. One accident is enough to precipitate things.""
He did not mention Hawaii or North Korea.
Pope Francis has often flagged the danger of nuclear warfare and in November he appeared to harden the Catholic Church’s teaching against nuclear weapons, saying countries should not stockpile them even for the purpose of deterrence.
As reporters boarded his plane bound for Chile, Vatican officials handed out a photograph taken in 1945 that shows a young Japanese boy carrying his dead brother on his shoulders following the U.S. nuclear attack on Nagasaki.
""I was moved when I saw this. The only thing I could think of adding were the words 'the fruit of war',"" Francis said, referring to a caption put on the back of the image.

""I wanted to have it reprinted and distributed because an image like this can be more moving than a thousand words. That is why I wanted to share it with you,"" he said.

CAIRO (Reuters) - The nephew of assassinated Egyptian president Anwar al-Sadat said on Monday he would not, as widely expected, challenge incumbent Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in the presidential election because an environment of fear surrounds the vote.
Sisi has yet to announce his candidacy but is widely expected to run and easily win a ballot slated for March 26-28.
Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat, whose uncle led a sweeping economic liberalization program and opened ties with Israel before his assassination in 1981, had previously said he was mulling a run.
Though unlikely to upset Sisi's campaign, it would have carried the weight of a household name likely to garner some support. 
Sisi, a general-turned-president, came to power in 2014, a year after he led the military in ousting elected but unpopular Islamist President Mohamed Mursi. Rights groups say Sisi has since led an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents, activists and critical media.
In a news conference accompanied by detailed election brochures and a video supporting his would-be campaign, Sadat announced that he had halted his run, denouncing what he called an election environment of fear where state-aligned media had pushed out opposing voices.
""Our real problem is can we, in this current environment and with what's happening now, move forward? I don't think so... so we've decided that we will not participate."" 
Sadat said he feared for the safety of supporters who had volunteered to collect votes of confidence required to appear on the ballot. 
""People who volunteered to collect votes of confidence were scared away ... I'm scared for the young men and women and don't want to expose them to this, because we won't be able to do anything for them,"" he said. 
Last week Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik, seen as the most serious potential challenger to date, said he was no longer considering a bid following a firestorm of criticism from state-aligned media and speculation that he was being held by authorities in a Cairo hotel. 
Sisi's critics say his popularity has been dimmed by painful economic reforms, security problems and a crackdown on dissidents. Still, he is expected to readily win an election that has seen few serious challengers come forward.

The demonstrations, which began over economic hardships in late December, spread to more than 80 cities and towns and resulted in 25 deaths. 
Demonstrators initially vented their anger over high prices and alleged corruption, but the protests took on a rare political dimension, with a growing number of people calling on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down.
Judicial officials have announced more than 1,000 arrests around the country, but lawmaker Mahmoud Sadeghi said last week that at least 3,700 people had been detained.
Several detainees have died in custody, and human rights activists have called for an independent investigation of their cases. 
The deputy speaker of parliament, Ali Motahari, was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA on Sunday that based on reports received ""one detainee in Tehran and two in other provinces"" had died in jail.
The judiciary has confirmed two deaths in custody but said they have committed suicide.
""More than 440 people who were arrested in Tehran riots have been released,"" Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi was quoted as saying by Mehr news agency on Sunday.
Dolatabadi said most of those held during the protests were from low income families, and were 18 to 35 years old.
Iran's judiciary spokesman said on Sunday that Iranian authorities had arrested a dual national who was taking pictures during recent unrest, but gave no details of the person's nationality.
The United States imposed sanctions on 14 individuals and entities on Friday for human rights abuses in Iran and for supporting Iranian weapons programs, including the head of Iran’s judiciary, Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani.

Larijani is a close ally of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Larijani was quoted by ISNA news agency as saying on Monday that imposing sanctions on him as the head of the judiciary was ""crossing the line"" and said Iran would not remain silent against such action.

Dozens of princes, senior officials and top businessmen were detained and confined in the opulent Ritz-Carlton Riyadh as the government launched the purge in early November. The hotel was closed to normal business.
On Monday, an employee at the office taking bookings for the hotel, who declined to be named, told Reuters by telephone that bookings by the public would be accepted from Feb. 14. 
The hotel's website now accepts bookings from Feb. 14, quoting a nightly rate for its cheapest room of 2,439 riyals ($650).
Official sources told Reuters earlier that Saudi authorities were close to winding up a major part of the crackdown, which would allow them to return the Ritz-Carlton to normal operations. 
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Marriott hotel group, which owns the Ritz-Carlton brand, said: ""The hotel is operating under the directive of local authorities and not as a traditional hotel for the time being."" The spokesperson declined to elaborate or discuss when the hotel might reopen.
Saudi authorities have said they expect the vast majority of suspects to agree to financial settlements of charges against them, and that Riyadh hopes to recover about $100 billion of illicit funds. A small number are expected to be prosecuted.
Construction giant Saudi Binladin Group said on Saturday that some of its shareholders might transfer part of their holdings to the state in a settlement with authorities. Chairman Bakr Bin Laden and several family members were detained in the crackdown.
In late November, senior Saudi Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, once seen as a leading contender to the throne, was freed after reaching a settlement with authorities that involved paying more than $1 billion, according to a Saudi official.
Another top businessman who has been held at the Ritz-Carlton is billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman and owner of global investment firm Kingdom Holding. A Saudi official told Reuters this week that he was negotiating a possible settlement but so far had not agreed on terms.

The hotel has 492 guest rooms and suites and 52 acres (21 hectares) of landscaped gardens, according to its website.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 07:59AM ET</span>",Madrid to keep ruling Catalonia if exiled ex-leader reelected: PM,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain will continue to rule the regional administration of Catalonia directly from Madrid in the event that its self-exiled former leader Carles Puigdemont is chosen as president by the Catalan parliament, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on Monday.
Puigdemont fled to Brussels in October after Rajoy fired him as Catalonia's leader when he declared an independent republic following an illegal referendum. He faces arrest and possibly decades in jail if he returns to Spain. 
With only days before Catalonia's parliament convenes to elect a new regional government, separatists said Puigdemont was their candidate to lead the region again. They are exploring the possibility he could do so by video link from Brussels.
But Rajoy on Monday poured scorn on the idea.
""It's absurd that someone aspires to be president of the Catalan regional government as a fugitive in Brussels - it's a case of common sense,"" he said in a speech at his center-right People's Party (PP) Madrid headquarters. 
If Puigdemont tried to attend the parliamentary vote for a new head of region from Brussels, the Spanish government would challenge his appearance immediately in the courts, he said.
Rajoy said if Puigdemont was re-elected, constitutional powers invoked by the government in October to impose direct rule on the region would continue to apply. 
Rajoy had called regional elections in December to try and resolve the political crisis that led to an exodus of companies from the region. 
However, the election returned a slim majority to parties favoring independence, raising the possibility of a renewed push for a split from Spain this year. 

The parliament will meet for the first time on Jan. 17 to choose the committee that rules its day-to-day activities. A new leader could be voted in by parliament as early as Jan. 31.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said that as chief architect of foreign policy, Duterte allowed China to work with the University of the Philippines in Benham Rise, an area roughly the size of Greece and believed by some scientists to be rich in biodiversity and tuna.
The United Nations declared Benham Rise, off the Pacific coast, part of the continental shelf of the Philippines in 2012. Manila last year renamed it the ""Philippine Rise"".
Though China does not lay claim to the area, the lingering presence of its vessels for several months in late 2016 triggered concern about its intentions.
The Philippines granting of the permission to China was not announced and was revealed a few days ago by a lawmaker who has been fiercely critical of Duterte's close ties with Beijing.
The Philippines and China have a long history of maritime squabbles over sovereignty in the South China Sea, but there has been no disagreement about waters off Manila's Pacific coast.
Roque said anyone opposed to the joint research project should go to Congress and raise the issue there.
""If this is not a wise move of the president, then a law could be enacted to prohibit it,"" he said.

The Philippines would grant permission to any other country that might show interest in conducting maritime research at Benham Rise, he added.

German security officials have been on high alert since a failed asylum seeker killed 12 people by plowing a truck in Christmas market in Berlin in December 2016. 
The GSG-9, as the unit is known, was founded some 45 years ago after German police lacking special forces that include snipers and negotiators bungled an operation to save Israeli athletes kidnapped by Palestinian militants at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.
Eleven Israelis, a German policeman as well as five of the Palestinian gunmen, died after a stand-off at the poorly secured athletes village and then a nearby airfield.
The attack in Berlin by rejected Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri exposed flaws in how Germany's surveillance agencies work and heightened fears that Islamist militants entered Germany after it opened its borders in 2015 to more than a million people seeking asylum. 
""If one looks at similar terrorist situations throughout Europe, the capitals were often affected,"" GSG-9 commander Jerome Fuchs told Deutschlandfunk radio, adding that the goal of moving to Berlin was to have fast responsiveness in the capital.
Dozens of people have been killed in militant attacks in major European cities like Paris, Barcelona, Nice, Brussels and London over the past three years, making security a top priority for many European Union countries.
Germany's GSG-9 unit is currently based in Sankt Augustin, a town near the city of Bonn.

GSG-9 commando grabbed international attention in 1977 when it succeeded in freeing a Lufthansa plane that was hijacked by a Palestinian militia and flown to Mogadishu, Somalia.

Nguyen Van Oai, 36, a prominent human rights activist and blogger who has been publicly critical of the Vietnamese government's handling of human rights and environmental issues had been sentenced to four years in jail in 2013 for ""activities aimed at overthrowing the government"".
He was released in January 2017 after serving his term but arrested days later for violating the terms of his probation and resisting arrest.
The Supreme People's Court of Vietnam said on its website that Oai had insulted and beaten two security personnel who were monitoring his probation. 
He was then sentenced to another five years in jail last September and a further four years on probation.
Following an appeal, Oai's jail term and probation were both upheld on Monday, the state newspaper Vietnamplus reported. 
""The verdict was unfair and not objective,"" Oai's lawyer, Ha Huy Son, told Reuters by telephone. 
The People's Court, which held the trial in the central province of Nghe An, did not respond to a request for comment outside office hours.
Despite sweeping economic reforms and growing openness to social change, communist Vietnam retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism.
In November, a court upheld a 10-year jail sentence for another prominent blogger, Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, known as ""Me Nam"", or Mother Mushroom, who was jailed for publishing propaganda against the state. 
Human rights groups have expressed alarm over Vietnam's biggest crackdown on activists and dissidents for years.
""This is more proof that Vietnam's 'appeal' process is a charade for international consumption, with its kangaroo courts only acting positively when the government indicates the convicted individual has been highly cooperative,"" said Phil Robertson, Human Rights Watch deputy director for Asia.

""I spoke with the finance minister, ...prime minister, and several other ministers and asked them to cancel the gazette immediately. The gazette will be withdrawn from tomorrow,"" President Maithripala Sirisena said at an election rally on Sunday.
The move comes as the government's main coalition partners, the center-left Sri Lanka Freedom Party and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's center-right United National Party, are campaigning for long-delayed local elections. 
Officials at the finance ministry said the ban was lifted after repeated requests from the tourism industry to extend bar hours and allow female tourists to buy alcohol. 
But that move was criticized by opposition parliamentarians who said the move would damage Sri Lanka's Buddhist values. Sinhalese Buddhists account for more than 70 percent of the island nation's 21 million population.

The attack in Aviation Square was one of the deadliest in Baghdad since a massive truck bomb killed at least 324 people in the nearby commercial district of Karrada in July 2016.
The Karrada bombing was the deadliest single attack in Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein.

TOKYO/BEIJING (Reuters) - A stricken Iranian tanker that sank in the East China Sea on Sunday in the worst oil ship disaster in decades has produced a large oil slick, Chinese media and Japanese authorities said on Monday, as worries grew over damage to the marine ecosystem.
The tanker Sanchi (IMO:9356608) had been adrift and ablaze after crashing into the freighter CF Crystal (IMO:9497050) on Jan. 6. Strong winds had pushed it away from the Chinese coast, where the incident happened, and into Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). 
The Japan Coast Guard said oil had spread over an area 13 km (8.1 miles) long and 11 km (6.8 miles) wide, although it said the slick was shrinking as patrol boats battled to contain it.
The Coast Guard said the fire on the sea surface was put out at around 0200 GMT on Monday, although according to other authorities and Chinese state TV CCTV black smoke continued to billow from the site of the sinking for several more hours. 
A clean-up effort has begun and rescue teams have called a halt to the large-scale search for survivors, reducing it to ""normal"" operations, CCTV said.
The Sanchi's crew of 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis are all believed to have perished in the incident, which marks the biggest tanker spill since 1991, when 260,000 tonnes of oil leaked off the Angolan coast.
The East China Sea is known for its rich, although already polluted, marine ecosystem that includes whales, porpoises and seabirds, said Rick Steiner, a U.S. marine scientist with experience of oil spills. 
Greenpeace said in a statement the explosion and sinking had occurred in ""an important (fish) spawning ground"".
""At this time of year the area is used as wintering ground by common edible species such as hairtail, yellow croaker, chub mackerel and blue crab. The area is also on the migratory pathway of many marine mammals, such as humpback whale, right whale and gray whale,"" Greenpeace said.
HIGHLY FLAMMABLE OIL
The blazing vessel, which had been carrying 136,000 tonnes - almost one million barrels - of condensate, an ultra-light, highly flammable crude oil, sank on Sunday after several explosions weakened the hull. 
The Shanghai Maritime Bureau, under China's Ministry of Transport, said shortly before 0800 GMT on Monday there was no more heavy smoke at the scene. 
Japanese authorities lost track of the tanker as of 0840 GMT on Sunday, a spokesman for Japan's Coast Guard said. The ship's last confirmed location was about 315 km (195 miles) west of Sokkozaki on the island of Amami Oshima, one of the northern islands in the Ryukyu island chain that includes Okinawa.
Japan sent two patrol boats and an airplane to the area to search for missing crew members and assess the latest situation, the Coast Guard spokesman said. 
The Shanghai Maritime Bureau said these, along with a South Korean patrol boat, were among the vessels carrying out emergency response work on Monday. 
A Chinese salvage team on Saturday recovered two bodies from the tanker, China's state news agency Xinhua reported. Another body, presumed to be one of the Sanchi's sailors, was found on Jan. 8 and taken to Shanghai for identification. 
Iranian officials said on Sunday the remaining 29 crew members and passengers of the tanker were presumed dead.
The salvage team recovered the Sanchi's voyage data recorder, or ""black box"" from the bridge of the tanker, Xinhua said on Saturday. But the team was forced to leave the ship after just half an hour because the wind shifted and ""thick toxic smoke"" had complicated the operation. 
""Finding the black box will be helpful for all parties in correctly determining the reasons for the accident,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Monday. 
Lu said rescue and clean-up efforts had been a focus for China from the beginning, but that Beijing welcomed ""other relevant parties"" to participate in both the search and rescue and treatment work. 
""TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE""
Experts worry the ship's sinking is potentially more damaging to the marine ecosystem than letting the condensate oil burn off. The sinking will likely expel the remaining condensate and the tanker's bunker fuel, or the heavy fuel oil that powers a ship's engines, contaminating the surrounding waters. 
Bunker fuel is the dirtiest kind of oil, extremely toxic when spilled, though less explosive. Condensate is poisonous to marine organisms. 
""As with all major oil spills, time is of the essence. This is particularly so with condensate spills, as the substance is so toxic and volatile,"" said Steiner, the U.S. marine scientist.
Fuel oil is relatively easy to contain because volumes are lower and its viscosity means it is easier to extract from water, but even small volumes can harm marine life. 
A Suezmax tanker can hold a maximum of 5,000 tonnes of bunker fuel. The Sanchi may have been carrying about 1,000 tonnes by the time it hit the grain freighter CF Crystal, according to bunker fuel traders' estimates. 
""As the fuel oil cools, it will become more viscous which will help to slow or even prevent leaks,"" Greenpeace said. ""In this scenario, it is possible that we will see chronic low volume leakage over a period of time at the seabed. Impact would remain relatively local.""

Protests which started about a week ago erupted again on Sunday, fueled by anger at tax and price increases imposed by the government to cut a budget deficit.
A Reuters witness saw youths throwing stones at police cars and setting fire to tires before security forces drove them back with tear gas in the Ettadamen district in Tunis last night. There were also protests in Kram district.
On Monday, the situation was calm.
‮""‬The movements (protests) were limited to Ettadamen, Daoura, Hicher and Kram in the capital and in Sidi Bouzid and Feriana,‮""‬ Khelifa Chibani, spokesman of the interior ministry, said. Some protestors had tried to break into a customs building, he added.

Tunisia has been hailed as the only democratic success of the Arab Spring: the one Arab country to topple a long-serving leader in those uprisings without triggering widespread violence or civil war. 

But Tunisia has had nine governments since Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali's overthrow in 2011, none of which have been able to resolve deep-rooted economic problems. The economy has worsened since a vital tourism sector was nearly wiped out by a wave of deadly militant attacks in 2015.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - A mezzanine floor overlooking the main lobby of the Indonesian Stock Exchange building collapsed on Monday, injuring scores of people, many of them students, under slabs of concrete and other debris.
The high-rise building, constructed in the late 1990s, is part of a two-tower complex in the heart of the financial district and houses dozens of other offices including the World Bank. It was the target of a car bombing by Islamist militants in September 2000. 
Police ruled out a bomb as a cause of Monday's collapse. They said more than 70 people had been injured, but no deaths had been reported. 
Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan visited the site and said the city will ""audit the building"", which was last inspected by authorities in May.
""I have conveyed to the building's management that the audit of the construction should start tonight so that the activities of the stock exchange are not disturbed,"" Baswedan told reporters.
Safety standards are often loosely enforced in Indonesia. Last year, a fire that ripped through a fireworks factory on the outskirts of Jakarta killed around 50 people in one of the country's worst industrial accidents. A police investigation found multiple safety violations.
Many of the injured were university students who were on the mezzanine floor when it collapsed.
""There was a rumbling noise but it wasn't an explosion. It was like something had fallen, and suddenly the floor we were standing on fell away,"" said student Alfita, 20, who uses one name. She escaped with light bruises. 
Dramatic CCTV footage aired on television showed a floor shearing away in a matter of seconds under the students. Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
""Slabs of concrete started to fall, there was lots of dust. Water pipes had burst,"" said Megha Kapoor, who works in the building and was in the lobby at the time.
Police cordoned off the complex as people fled the building and the more seriously injured were taken away by stretcher. 
Triana Tambunan, business development manager at MRCC Siloam hospital, one of the hospitals near the building, said 30 people had been admitted so far. Victims were being treated at four hospitals.
""The bone fractures may be serious. We need to carry out further evaluations,"" she said, adding there were at least three suspected fractures. 
Stock exchange president director Tito Sulistio said the exchange would pay for the treatment of the visiting students.

Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said she hoped the collapse would not affect investor confidence in the tropical Southeast Asian archipelago. The exchange resumed business in the afternoon as per schedule.

Lavrov spoke days after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would waive nuclear sanctions against Iran for the last time to give Washington and its European allies a chance to fix the ""terrible flaws"" of the 2015 nuclear deal.
""We will not support what the United States is trying to do, changing the wording of the agreement, incorporating things that will be absolutely unacceptable for Iran,"" Lavrov told a news conference in Moscow. 
Russia's top diplomat, who stressed that Russia will work to preserve the existing Iran nuclear deal, also warned that the agreement's collapse could be detrimental to dialogue with North Korea. 
Lavrov suggested Pyongyang would look at how Iran had been treated by Washington and wonder if any deal it did with the United States on its own missile and nuclear program would hold or also be called into question.
""If the deal is put aside and Iran is told, 'you keep up with your obligations or we will impose sanctions again', then you have to see it from North Korea's point of view,"" said Lavrov, stressing the international community should approach the two countries' nuclear programs in the same manner. 
""They are being promised that sanctions will be lifted if they give up their nuclear program. They will give it up, but no one will lift the sanctions against Pyongyang.""
In separate comments on Monday, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran's National Security Council, said Trump's threats to withdraw from the nuclear deal were fanning ""Iranophobia"" and meant to deprive Tehran of the agreement's economic benefits.
""Scaring the international community with the decisions of a mad man is a repetitive tactic that has proved to be ineffective,"" Fars news agency quoted Shamkhani as saying.

The row over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), as it is formally known, has held up its prospects of joining both the European Union and NATO.
Macedonia took that name when it became independent in 1991 following the break-up of Yugoslavia. Greece has challenged it since, saying it implies territorial claims to the Greek region of the same name and of the ancient Greek kingdom ruled by Alexander the Great.
In an interview with Greek state television ahead of talks in New York on Wednesday with diplomats from both countries, U.N. mediator Matthew Nimetz said: ""In both countries there is a positive momentum""
""I think the people in both countries are maybe ready to hear some solutions that are consistent with national interests but also have some element of compromise that would resolve the problem.""
Nimetz said the new government in Skopje was ""very interested"" in resolving the issue.
Athens has only agreed that the country be referred to internationally as ""FYROM"" until the row is resolved. That is the name under which it was admitted to the U.N in 1993 and the name which the EU and other bodies use for it.
Greek government officials have suggested that Athens would try to focus on brokering an agreement that calls for a compound name with a geographical qualifier. Suggestions floated have included upper or northern.
Asked if he would present a new name in the latest round of talks, Nimetz said ""there's always a new way of looking at things ... of course there's nothing totally new, there's no new magic, we know what the problems are.""

Greeks are highly sensitive about the name issue. Nearly 70 percent said they did not want the term ""Macedonia"" used in any solution, a poll showed on Sunday, and rallies have been planned in Athens and in northern Greece in the coming weeks.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Militant Islamist group Boko Haram released a video on Monday purportedly showing some of the remaining girls who were kidnapped from the northeast Nigerian town of Chibok in 2014. 
Of the some 270 girls who were originally abducted from their school, about 60 escaped soon afterwards and others have since been released after mediation. Around 100 are still believed to be in captivity.
A group of about 12 girls, some of whom are carrying babies, are seen in the 21-minute video. 
""We are the Chibok girls. We are the ones you are crying about for us to come back. By the grace of Allah, we are never coming back,"" said one of the girls. Reuters was unable to independently verify the claim that the girls were among those kidnapped in Chibok. 
Abubakar Shekau - the leader of one of the group's factions - also appears in the video, which was obtained by a U.S.-based journalism website, Sahara Reporters. 
Last May, Boko Haram exchanged 82 of the girls after mediation, involving a payment to the insurgents and the release of some of the group's imprisoned senior members. Prior to that, 24 had been released or found in 2016.

Boko Haram has killed more than 20,000 people and forced two million others to flee their homes in an insurgency that began in 2009 aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate. Aid groups say the militants have kidnapped thousands of adults and children, many of whose cases are neglected.

Johnson, one of the most senior pro-Brexit government ministers, is seen as a potential successor to Prime Minister Theresa May. He was one of the most prominent supporters of leaving the European Union during a divisive referendum campaign.
""I'd rather us stay in than leave like that,"" the newspaper quoted Johnson as telling friends in an unsourced report.

May, who voted 'Remain' in 2016 but has committed to guiding Britain out of the bloc, is seeking a two year transition period after a March 2019 exit, during which Brussels rules would still apply. She wants a long term divorce deal that would allow ""frictionless"" trade with the bloc.
That plan has led to criticism from some Brexit advocates that Britain could end up leaving in name only, and would remain subject to rules set by the EU. 

Last week another senior Brexit campaigner, Nigel Farage, said he was warming to the idea of a second referendum as a way to end attempts by some senior politicians, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, to stop Britain from leaving.

The incursion by the fighters from the southern Philippines into Malaysia's Sabah state sparked a month-long crisis and at least 27 people were killed when Malaysian troops backed by fighter jets eventually subdued the militants.
The conflict disrupted operations in Sabah’s huge palm oil industry and at the time, raised concern that prolonged trouble could dampen investor interest in energy and infrastructure projects in the state.
The nine were among fighters captured.
A five-member Federal Court panel unanimously ruled that the death sentences were the most appropriate, upholding a decision by a lower court to increase the penalty from life sentences, according to the state news agency Bernama.
The court also upheld a lower court's decision to release 14 other men who had been held in connection with the fighting in the sleepy Lahad Datu district.
The fighters were from a group that has demanded recognition, and an increased payment from Malaysia, for their claim to be the rightful owners of Sabah, which an ancient sultanate leased to British colonialists in the 19th century.
Malaysia dismissed their demands and the Philippine government repeatedly told the group to put down their weapons and go home.
The fighters declared loyalty to the self-proclaimed Sultan of the southern Philippine region of Sulu, Jamalul Kiram, in the Philippines.

Henry Bolton, 54, who became the ailing UK Independence Party's fourth leader in a year when he was elected last September, said he had ended his relationship with model Jo Marney after the ""appalling"" text messages she sent to a friend were published.
Marney, 25, who began dating Bolton just after Christmas, had described U.S. actress Markle, whose father is white and mother is African-American, as a ""dumb little commoner"" and said ""her seed with (sic) taint our royal family"", according to the texts printed in the Mail on Sunday newspaper. 
Marney also described black people as ugly. 
""The romantic element of the relationship is over,"" Bolton told BBC radio, saying they had split up on Sunday night.
""However appalling and insulting those comments she made in those direct personal messages were ... I honestly don't believe those are her core beliefs.""
Harry said Markle had been subjected to ""outright sexism and racism"" on social media when he revealed they were first dating in 2016 and that there had also been racial undertones in newspaper comment pieces. The couple announced in November that they were engaged and will marry in May.
Led by the charismatic Nigel Farage, UKIP won nearly four million votes in 2015, 12.6 percent of those cast, on its anti-EU platform, projecting it to the forefront of British politics even though it only managed to win one seat in parliament.
Its success helped force former Conservative prime minister David Cameron, who once dismissed the party as being full of ""fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists"", to agree to hold the 2016 referendum on whether to leave the EU and played a role in encouraging Britons to vote for Brexit.
But UKIP has been riven by internal strife since the referendum as it struggles for direction and a clear purpose and it won just 1.8 percent of the total votes cast in a national election last June.
Marney was suspended from UKIP after the texts became public on Sunday and senior party figures called for Bolton, a former army infantry officer who also served in the police, to step down himself.
""People have been able to use Jo in order to attack me,"" he said. ""I have no intention of resigning and indeed the people who have been calling for my resignation are people who for some time have been trying to work to undermine the leadership of the party in any case.""
He said there had not been a ""cold parting of the ways"" but his job had to take priority.

""She is utterly devastated. I'm not defending the comments she made, she's not defending the comments she made,"" he said. ""Jo is incredibly upset as am I, I'm going to stand by her and the family in terms of trying to put her life back together.""

The suspect, David James Roach, allegedly stole SS$30,000 ($22,691) from a  Standard Chartered  bank (LON:STAN) branch in July 2016, before fleeing to Thailand where he was arrested. 
After serving a prison sentence for criminal offences in Thailand, Roach was deported and arrived in London on Jan. 11, where he was detained by British authorities, Singapore's Attorney General's Chambers and the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement. 
""We sought the assistance of the UK authorities to arrest Roach, with a view to his eventual extradition to Singapore,"" they said. 
""We are working with the UK authorities to commence the extradition proceedings.""
The rare bank robbery in Singapore sparked a flurry of debate about whether the country has grown too complacent about security.
Singapore has very low levels of crime, thanks in part to decades of strict policing and tough punishments, ranging from death for drug trafficking and murder to prison and caning for lesser crimes.
A senior official in Thailand's Immigration Bureau, Major General Choochat Thareechat, said Roach had been deported last week, but to Canada, not to Britain.
He declined to comment when asked about Roach's travel arrangements after leaving Thailand.

1472,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 03:11AM ET</span>","Myanmar says temporary camp will house 30,000 Rohingya targeted for repatriation","YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar is building a camp to temporarily house 30,000 Rohingya Muslims targeted for repatriation after fleeing violence in Rakhine State, state media reported on Monday, as Myanmar and Bangladesh meet to discuss how to implement a repatriation deal.
More than 650,000 Rohingya have headed across the border to Bangladesh after a sweeping Myanmar army counteroffensive in response to Rohingya militant attacks on Aug. 25, 2017. 
The crackdown has been described by the United States and U.N. as ethnic cleansing, which Myanmar repeatedly rejects.
Officials from Myanmar and Bangladesh meet on Monday to discuss a repatriation deal signed on Nov. 23. The meeting in Myanmar's capital, Naypyitaw, is the first for a joint working group set up to hammer out the details of the agreement. 
The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said a camp in Hla Po Khaung in northern Rakhine will be a temporary transition camp for people who are to be ""accepted systematically"" for repatriation.
""The 124-acre Hla Po Khaung will accommodate about 30,000 people in its 625 buildings,"" the newspaper said, adding that some 100 buildings will be completed by end of January. 
Aung Tun Thet, chief coordinator of Myanmar's Union Enterprises for Humanitarian Assistance, Resettlement and Development, told Reuters that the camp in Hla Po Khaung will be a ""transition place"" for Rohingya refugees before they are repatriated to their ""place of origin"" or the nearest settlement to their place of origin.
""We will try to accept all of those who are coming back to Myanmar,"" he said, adding that to verify returnees' residency, they will be sent to assessment camps in Taungpyoletwei or Ngakhuya before they are moved to the Hla Po Khaung camp. 
Soe Aung, permanent secretary of Myanmar's Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, said returnees will spend ""at least one or two months"" in Hla Po Khaung before their new homes are built. 
It is unclear, however, how many returnees would qualify for citizenship in Myanmar. The authorities have said Rohingya Muslims could apply for citizenship if they can show their forebears lived in Myanmar. But the latest deal - like the one in 1992 - does not guarantee citizenship.
Myanmar government officials have said the 1992-1993 repatriation deal, which followed a previous spasm of violence in Myanmar, would accept those who could present identity documents issued to the Rohingya by governments in the past.
Buddhist-majority Myanmar has for years denied Rohingya citizenship, freedom of movement and access to basic services such as healthcare and education. They are considered illegal immigrants from mainly Muslim Bangladesh. 
Bangladesh officials have said it was unclear when the first refugees could actually return as the two countries need to work out how to jointly verify the identities of returnees.
United Nations agencies and human rights watchers have voiced scepticism about the resettlement plans and demanded a more transparent process to safeguard the Rohingya's voluntary return.

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia began screening feature-length animated children's films this weekend in a makeshift theater, after a 35-year-old ban on cinemas was lifted in the conservative Islamic kingdom.
The first permanent theaters could open as early as March, part of a liberalizing reform drive that has already opened the door to concerts, comedy shows and women drivers over the past year.
For now, the authorities are sponsoring temporary settings, like the state-run cultural hall in the Red Sea city of Jeddah equipped with a projector, a red carpet and a popcorn machine.
""Until now, there is no infrastructure for movie theaters, so we are trying to take advantage of (alternative) venues to approximate the cinematic form,"" said Mamdouh Salim, whose Cinema 70 brand organized the week-long screenings.
""We tried to use these films to be a starting point as the first cinematic screening after the decision on Dec. 11 to permit movie theaters.""
Cinemas were banned in the early 1980s under pressure from Islamists as Saudi society turned towards a particularly conservative form of religion that discouraged public entertainment and public mixing between men and women.
But reforms led by 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman have eased many of those restrictions, as the government tries to broaden the economy and lessen its dependence on oil.
In a nod to conservatives, films will be censored to make sure they remain in line with the kingdom's ""moral values"".
MORE FUN
After watching The Emoji Movie with his wife and daughter on Sunday evening, 28-year-old Sultan al-Otaibi said Saudis are happy to see movies in the theater instead of staying at home.
""It's more comfortable, more fun to have a change of scenery and an activity on the weekend. It is a step that was very late in coming but thank God it's happening now.""
Thousands of Saudis currently travel to Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and other countries for entertainment. The government wants to retain the money spent on those trips.
The authorities expect to open 300 cinemas with 2,000 screens by 2030, building an industry it hopes will contribute more then 90 billion riyals ($24 billion) to the economy and create 30,000 permanent jobs.
Regional and international cinema chains are also eyeing the Saudi market, keen to tap the spending power of the young people who make up roughly 70 percent of the population.
""I want to see everything because it is something new for Saudi,"" said 30-year-old movie-goer Ibtisam Abu Talib. ""I hope everything is available - action, romance, children's films, comedy. Everything, God willing.""

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 02:30AM ET</span>",Signs of division in Cambodia's opposition over new group,"By Prak Chan Thul
PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Signs of division emerged among opponents of long-serving Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen on Monday after prominent exiles said they had founded a new movement following a ban on the main opposition party.
Hun Sen, who celebrated 33 years in power on Sunday, has become a master at dividing his opponents and using force and legal measures to neutralize challenges to his rule.
The new opposition movement was announced at the weekend by Hun Sen's veteran foe Sam Rainsy following the dissolution of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) last year and the arrest of its leader, Kem Sokha.
But Kem Sokha's former cabinet chief said there was no need for the new Cambodia National Rescue Movement (CNRM).
""The CNRP represents the will of the more than three million people who voted for it, so we continue to move forward within the framework of the CNRP, without changing,"" Muth Chantha said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
The CNRP was dissolved after the arrest of Kem Sokha, who was accused of plotting to take power with American help - charges he says were politically motivated because the threat the party posed to Hun Sen at this year's election.
The dissolution of the party and arrest of Kem Sokha have been condemned by Western aid donors who have said the election cannot now be credible. Hun Sen, 65, is expected to win easily.
The CNRP was set up in 2012 to unify Sam Rainsy's and Kem Sokha's separate parties. Its success in a 2013 general election and local elections last year had shown what a powerful electoral force it had become.
Sam Rainsy served as finance minister in an ill-fated coalition set up when Hun Sen refused to give up power after losing a U.N.-organized election in 1993.
He has lived in France since 2015 to avoid a series of convictions he says were politically motivated.
Sam Rainsy said on Sunday the new CNRM could launch appeals to the people to organize peaceful protests, to workers to go on strike and to the armed forces to join them - although at this stage it has made no specific call for action.
On the streets of the capital, Phnom Penh, an opposition stronghold, the formation of the new movement met scepticism from CNRP supporters.
""Even though people are still with the opposition party, they want to stay quiet, people are afraid to protest,"" said Phat Sokan, a 38-year old vegetable seller.
Hing Soksan, the former director of the youth wing of the CNRP, urged Sam Rainsy to reconsider the move and said the new movement would also endanger former CNRP members.
""A majority of the masses expressed disapproval and asked why this movement is set up under these circumstances,"" he said.
Sam Rainsy and another senior opposition politician, Mu Sochua, who are members of the movement, did not respond immediately to requests for comment on the signs of division.
A government spokesman described the new movement as ""desperate"" on Sunday, adding that the Supreme Court had banned 118 of the CNRP's senior members from politics ahead of the general election on July 29.

The submarine, which Japan detected in the East China Sea, was a 110 meter-long Shang-class vessel, which is able to dive deeper and for longer than older boats and is armed with torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, according to Japan's Ministry of Defence.
""Operating a submerged submarine close to another country's territory goes against the norms of international rules,"" Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera told reporters.
While Chinese surface vessels often operate near Japanese islands on the edge of the East China Sea, the presence of a concealed submarine is viewed as a far more serious threat by Japan, which worries that China is flexing its military muscle in the waters that lead to the western Pacific as it consolidates control over the neighboring South China Sea.
The contested uninhabited islands in the East China Sea are known as the Senkaku in Japan, which controls them, and Diaoyu in China.
The Japanese criticism comes after Asia's two biggest economies had pledged to improve ties.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, who last week protested against the presence of the submarine and other Chinese navy ships near the disputed islands, described the presence of three Chinese coastguard vessels in the waters on Monday as ""regrettable"".

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 12:45AM ET</span>",Indonesia to swear in new parliament speaker after huge graft case,"By Agustinus Beo Da Costa and Kanupriya Kapoor
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's parliament will swear in Bambang Soesatyo as its new speaker on Monday, his party said, a critic of President Joko Widodo's government who was appointed after the previous speaker was indicted in a $170 million graft scandal.
Soesatyo is a long-time member of Golkar, the second-largest party in Widodo's coalition and which controls leadership of the house. Golkar appointed Soesatyo to replace previous speaker Setya Novanto, who was forced to resign late last year.
Analysts say Soesatyo's appointment could mean tougher negotiations in parliament for Widodo's government as it tries to push through reforms in the last year of his term before legislative and presidential elections in 2019.
""Jokowi may not have full control over the house like he did with the previous speaker,"" said Endy Bayuni, senior editor at The Jakarta Post newspaper. Jokowi is the president's widely used nickname.
""Politicians switch loyalty depending on where the wind blows, but Soesatyo's support is not automatic. Jokowi has to ensure that Golkar remains loyal to him,"" Bayuni said.
Despite Golkar being part of the ruling coalition, Soesatyo has previously criticised the president's handling of the economy, highlighting bureaucratic inefficiency and slow budget disbursement.
He also criticised Widodo's appointment of Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, a former World Bank director, saying it showed that Widodo's government was vulnerable to foreign influences.
""Soesatyo knows the party's position as a supporter of Jokowi,"" said Golkar deputy secretary general Muhamad Sarmuji. ""Even though he has been critical, it has only been because of his desire to contribute to the government's success.""
Soesatyo, a former businessman and journalist, would be sworn in during a plenary session later on Monday, Sarmuji said. The new speaker could not be reached immediately for comment.
Golkar had also come under pressure to elect a speaker to clean up the party's image and improve the standing of parliament, long regarded by Indonesians as riddled with entrenched corruption.
Previous speaker Novanto is accused of orchestrating a scheme to plunder $173 million from a government contract to introduce a national electronic identity card - almost 40 percent of the project's entire budget.
Novanto has denied wrongdoing in a case that has shocked Indonesians who are already used to large corruption scandals.
Some see Soesatyo's appointment as a missed opportunity for institutional reform. Soesatyo previously served on the parliamentary commission for legal affairs, where he lobbied for the popular anti-corruption agency's powers to be restricted.
""(The appointment) continues the ... strong position of politicians with webs of influence to fill in leadership positions in parliament,"" said Tobias Basuki, a Jakarta-based political analyst.

1477,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2018 10:05PM ET</span>",Hawaii says lack of adequate fail-safe measures led to false missile alert,"By Jolyn Rosa
HONOLULU (Reuters) - Human error and a lack of adequate fail-safe measures during a civil defense warning drill led to the false missile alert that stirred panic across Hawaii over the weekend, a state emergency management agency spokesman acknowledged on Sunday.
Elaborating on the origins of Saturday's false alarm, which went uncorrected for nearly 40 minutes, spokesman Richard Rapoza said the employee who mistakenly sent the missile alert ""has been temporarily reassigned"" to other duties.
Rapoza said an internal investigation of the blunder would be completed by week's end and that the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency welcomed outside review by the Federal Communications Commission, which has jurisdiction over wireless U.S. alert systems.
Rapoza also said that no further drills of the emergency alert system would be conducted until new measures were put in place to reduce the chance of future false alarms and to swiftly withdraw any warnings sent in error. 
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said on Sunday that the agency's probe of the incident so far suggested ""reasonable safeguards or process controls"" were lacking, a point that Rapoza said officials at the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency did not dispute. 
The error occurred when, in the midst of a drill during a shift change at the agency, an employee made the wrong selection from a ""drop-down"" computer menu, choosing to activate a missile launch warning instead of the option for generating an internal test alert, Rapoza said.
The employee, believing the correct selection had been made, then went ahead and clicked ""yes"" when the system's computer prompt asked whether to proceed, Rapoza said.
Governor David Ige initially said on Saturday that ""an employee pushed the wrong button.""
The resulting message, issued amid heightened international strains over North Korea's development of ballistic nuclear weapons, stated: ""EMERGENCY ALERT BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.""
'NOT MAKING ANY EXCUSES' 
It was transmitted to mobile phones and broadcast on television and radio across the Pacific island state shortly after 8 a.m. on Saturday, and took 38 minutes to be retracted by an official all-clear message. 
The mistake unleashed hysteria and confusion across the state, home to some 1.4 million people and a heavy concentration of U.S. military command structure.
Civil defense officials have said that in the event of a real missile attack from North Korea, people in Hawaii would have only about 12 minutes to find shelter.
In November, Hawaii said it would resume monthly statewide testing of Cold War-era nuclear attack warning sirens for the first time in at least a quarter of a century, in preparation for a possible missile strike from North Korea.
Ige, who said he was ""angry and disappointed"" by Saturday's incident, said some sirens went off after the false alarm.
To prevent a repeat, the Emergency Management Agency will now require two employees to activate the alert system - one to issue the warning and another to confirm it. The agency also has incorporated a way of issuing an immediate false-alarm notice in the event of an error.
""That's something we were lacking yesterday,"" Rapoza told Reuters by telephone. ""Our focus was on getting the message out quickly, and not enough attention was paid to what happens if there's a mistake. And frankly, that was a failure of planning on our part. We're not making any excuses for it.""
U.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on Sunday during a visit to Florida and gave Hawaii state officials credit for admitting their mistake, saying: ""I loved that they took responsibility."" 
He added: ""But we're going to get involved,"" an apparent reference to the FCC's review of the incident. 
Trump, whose public war of words with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, including a tweet boasting that he had a ""much bigger"" nuclear button than Kim, has widely been seen as stoking tensions, added: ""But maybe eventually we'll solve the problem"" so people in Hawaii ""don't have to be so on edge.""
Criticism of the state emergency management agency from other quarters was swift.

Lee Cataluna, a columnist for the state's largest newspaper, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, wrote in an opinion piece published on Sunday: ""It's the time for outrage. Somebody needs to get fired.""

Most of the dead were believed to be members of drug gangs, Veracruz Governor Miguel Angel Yunes told a news conference, citing tattoos found on the bodies. 
Before the discovery of the truck in Xalapa, the capital of the oil-rich state, authorities found the body of another man, who apparently had been killed as he tried to flee his captors, Yunes said. 
""It is clear that this was a confrontation between criminals,"" he said. 
Escalating tension between drug gangs contributed to a record high number of murders in Mexico in 2017, and it was a particularly bloody year in Veracruz. 
Murders in the Gulf state rose about 35 percent through November last year compared with the same period in 2016. Four of the 12 killings of reporters in Mexico last year took place in the state.
The weekend also saw violence in the northern state of Tamaulipas, where Juan Manuel Hernández, an official in the conservative National Action Party, was shot to death in his car on Saturday, according to a statement from the state. The state attorney general's office has launched an investigation.

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>","Trump says 'I'm not a racist,' keeps door open for DACA deal","By Steve Holland
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump insisted on Sunday ""I'm not a racist"" in response to reports that he had described immigrants from Haiti and African countries as coming from ""shithole countries.""
Trump also said he was ""ready, willing and able"" to reach a deal to protect illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children from being deported but that he did not believe Democrats wanted an agreement. He tweeted earlier on Sunday that the existing program would ""probably"" be discontinued.
The debate over immigration policy became increasingly acrimonious after it was reported on Thursday that the Republican president used the word ""shithole"" to describe Haiti and African countries in a private meeting with lawmakers.
The comments led to harsh recriminations from Democrats and Republicans alike, with some critics accusing Trump of racism, even as bipartisan talks continued in the U.S. Congress to seek a bipartisan compromise to salvage the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.
Asked by a reporter in Florida whether he was a racist, Trump said: ""No. I'm not a racist. I'm the least racist person you have ever interviewed.""
Trump has threatened to end DACA, but he seemed to keep the door open for a deal when he told reporters before dinner on Sunday night: ""We're ready, willing and able to make a deal on DACA, but I don't think the Democrats want to make a deal…. The Democrats are the ones that aren't going to make a deal.""
Efforts to extend the program are further complicated because it could make a funding bill to avert a government shutdown due Friday more difficult. 
""DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don't really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our military,"" Trump said earlier on Twitter.
CONTROVERSY SIMMERS
A U.S. judge ruled last Tuesday that DACA should remain in effect until legal challenges brought in multiple courts are resolved.
""I hope that we are actually going to work on fixing DACA,"" said Representative Mia Love on CNN's ""State of the Union"" program on Sunday. ""We cannot let this derail us.""
Love, whose parents are from Haiti, had criticized Trump for his remarks and called on him to apologize.
Trump denied making the disparaging remarks on Friday, although U.S. Senator Richard Durbin, who was in the White House meeting, said the president had used the term. One participant at the meeting on Sunday denied that Trump used the term and another said he did not recall Trump making such comments.
Asked on Sunday whether his inflammatory remarks made it harder to get a DACA deal, Trump said: ""Did you see what various senators in the room say about my comments? They weren't bad.""
Lawmakers hope to reach an immigration deal before Jan. 19, when Congress must pass a funding bill or the government will shut down. Some Democrats insist that the DACA question be addressed by then.
Lawmakers are trying to combine some form of relief for DACA immigrants along with enhanced border security, including a wall along the Mexican border, sought by Trump. The president's inflammatory comments left lawmakers struggling to find a path forward.
""I hope we can move beyond that. What was reported was unacceptable. But what we have to do is not let that define this moment,"" said Republican Senator Cory Gardner on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" program.
Republican Senator David Perdue, who was at the same White House meeting and had said he did not recall whether Trump made the comment, was more explicit on Sunday. He called the new stories a ""gross misrepresentation.""
""I'm telling you, he did not use that word,"" he said on ABC's ""This Week"" program.
However, Republicans and Democrats have both said they either heard Trump say it, or heard directly from colleagues who did.
Republican Senator Jeff Flake said on Sunday he was told about the remarks by colleagues who attended the meeting, before the news reports emerged.
""I heard that account before the account even went public,"" he said on ""This Week.""
One of Trump's top advisers, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, said on ""Fox News Sunday"" she did not recall if Trump used ""that specific phrase."" 

She also appeared to rebut Trump's remarks from earlier in the day. ""DACA is not dead,"" she said.

The National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla group and the government of President Juan Manuel Santos have been in formal peace talks for nearly a year, but the rebels launched a fresh offensive last week, killing members of the security forces, bombing major oil pipelines and kidnapping an oil contractor after the expiration of a 101-day ceasefire.
In response to the renewed attacks, Santos recalled the head of the government's team at the Quito talks to discuss the future of the negotiations.
""I urge the end of armed actions and the re-start of a serious and constructive dialogue with a view to fulfilling as soon as possible the commitment of the sides to reach a solution to the conflict by political means,"" said Guterres, wrapping up his two-day visit to the Andean country to discuss the progress of its 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels as well as the talks with the ELN.
""There is no justification for the armed conflict in Colombia to continue,"" he said, reiterating the U.N. Security Council's call for the rebels and the government to fortify future ceasefires and avoid a return to fighting. 

The ELN, founded by radical Roman Catholic priests in 1964, has sought peace with the government before but made little progress. It is considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union.

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Sunday he would only accept a broad, internationally-backed panel to broker any peace talks with Israel, but did not rule out a U.S. role in such a panel.
The Palestinians are seething at U.S. President Donald Trump's recognition last month of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and Abbas told a meeting of senior Palestinian officials in a speech that the move had disqualified the United States as a peacemaker.
Israel says it would welcome the United States as a mediator but a U.S. bid to revive negotiations, led by Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has so far shown no progress. Talks have been frozen since 2014.
Trump has said that achieving an agreement would be the ""deal of the century"" but Abbas was scathing on Sunday, saying: ""The deal of the century is actually the slap of the century, and we will return it.""
""We do not accept the United States as a mediator between us and Israel,"" Abbas said. ""Let it be an international committee formed at an international conference comprising four or five (countries or parties). But the United States alone? No.""
Abbas's comments were made at the start of a two-day meeting in Ramallah of the Palestinian Central Council, the Palestinians' highest decision-making body, where 95 delegates will debate future strategy.
""WILL NOT ACCEPT U.S. MEDIATION""
""We will not accept anything the United States may try to impose on us and we will not accept its mediation following that crime,"" said Abbas, referring to Trump's Jerusalem decision.
Palestinian officials have said they will not meet U.S. Vice President Mike Pence when he visits Egypt, Jordan and Israel this month.
Since 2002, a 'Quartet' of Middle East peace negotiators comprising the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations has been assigned to promote peace efforts, but failed to show any result.
Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital reversed decades of U.S. policy and has enraged Palestinians and triggered violent protests in Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Israel considers Jerusalem to be its eternal, indivisible capital. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. 
Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move never recognized internationally.

""Jerusalem was taken off the table by a tweet from Mr. Trump. Because of that we are meeting now, because there is nothing more important than Jerusalem,"" Abbas said.

1483,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2018 05:52PM ET</span>",China absence looms over Canada meeting on how to pressure North Korea,"By David Ljunggren
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Foreign ministers from around 20 nations gather on Tuesday to discuss how to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic and financial pressure, but China, seen as a key player in any long-term solution, will be absent.
The Vancouver meeting, co-hosted by Canada and the United States, comes amid signs that tensions on the peninsula have eased, at least temporarily. North and South Korea held talks for the first time in two years last week and Pyongyang says it will send athletes across the border to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
But the United States and others say the international community must look at ways of expanding a broad range of sanctions aimed at North Korea's nuclear program. 
""There is growing evidence that our maximum pressure campaign is being felt in North Korea. They are feeling the strain,"" said Brian Hook, the State Department's director of policy planning.
Hook told a briefing in Washington that participants, including U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, would examine how to boost maritime security around North Korea to intercept ships trying to defy sanctions as well as ""disrupting funding and disrupting resources.""
The 17-nation Proliferation Security Initiative, which aims to prevent the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction, on Friday said ""it is imperative for us to redouble our efforts to put maximum pressure on North Korea"".
But North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has shown no sign of willingness to give in to U.S. demands and negotiate away a weapons program he sees as vital to his survival.
Another challenge in Vancouver will be the absence of China, which has significant influence in North Korea. Beijing is Pyongyang's only ally and its chief trading partner.
The meeting primarily groups those nations that sent troops to the Korean war of 1950-53, when China fought alongside the North. Beijing condemned the gathering.
""Holding this kind of meeting that doesn't include important parties to the Korean peninsula nuclear issue actually cannot help in advancing an appropriate resolution to the issue,"" foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular briefing.
Other invitees include Japan and South Korea, front-line U.S. allies in the Washington-led effort against North Korea.
Hook said China and Russia - which is also not attending - would be fully briefed on the conclusions. That said, Beijing's absence will be felt, say diplomats.
""Without China there is a real limit as to what can be achieved,"" said one senior diplomatic source.
Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing, said the United States did not want Russia and China potentially distracting the discussion by raising their proposal to halt joint U.S.-South Korean military drills that the North says are a prelude to an invasion.
Fears of war have eased somewhat after the first round of intra-Korean talks in more than two years, and Trump, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, appeared to signal more of an openness toward diplomacy after a period of exchanging insults and threats with Kim.
But U.S. officials say hawks in the Trump administration remain pessimistic that the North-South contacts will lead anywhere.
Even so, debate within the U.S. administration over whether to give more active consideration to military options, such as a pre-emptive strike on a North Korean nuclear or missile site, has lost momentum ahead of February's Olympic games, the officials said.
For his part, Trump has vacillated between praising and criticizing China, which he has cast as critical to reining in North Korea's nuclear ambitions.
The White House on Friday welcomed news that China's imports from North Korea plunged in December to their lowest in dollar terms since at least the start of 2014, with trade curbed by United Nations sanctions.

Last month, however, Trump accused China of allowing oil into North Korea, which he said would prevent ""a friendly solution"" to the nuclear crisis. Beijing denied the charge.

1484,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2018 05:48PM ET</span>",Violent protests resume in Tunisia after two days of calm,"By Tarek Amara
TUNIS (Reuters) - Violent protests erupted again on Sunday in two areas of the capital Tunis and another town after a relatively calm two days, the latest protests in the country against austerity measures.
After nearly a week of at times violent protests, police used tear gas against dozens of young protesters in the Ettadamen district of Tunis in renewed demonstrations over a tax hike.
A Reuters witness saw youths around 20 years old throwing stones at police cars and setting fire to tires before security forces drove them back with tear gas.
Witnesses told Reuters that violent protests were also taking place in Kram district in the capital.
Protesters in Feriana city near the Algerian border tried to cut off roads and police were chasing protesters in the streets of the city and firing gas bombs.
Protests erupted last Monday in several towns and cities across Tunisia following tax and price hikes imposed on Jan. 1 by a government seeking to reduce a budget deficit to meet an agreement with its international donors.
Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of Tunisians demonstrated peacefully against government austerity measures in the capital, the seventh anniversary of the ousting of former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
Almost 800 people have been arrested for vandalism and acts of violence, including throwing petrol bombs at police stations, according to the interior ministry. 
The government late on Saturday pledged extra aid for poor families and those in need in response to the demonstrations but protesters still took to the streets, holding banners with slogans against rising prices and new taxes.
One rally took place in front of the Labor Union (UGTT) headquarters and several other protests were held along the central Habib Bourguiba Avenue, where hundreds of riot police had been deployed.
""This is what the government has done to us,"" said one a protester named Fouad. ""Pockets are empty because of unfair decisions by the government ... I am a professor and my wife is a teacher, but we are suffering today to meet our needs.""
""We have only won the freedom of expression after the 2011 revolution ... but we will remain in the streets until we win our economic rights just as we have our freedom,"" he added.
Police were seeking to separate supporters of the opposition Popular Front party and the Islamist Ennahda party, which is part of the ruling coalition. The government and Ennahda accuse the PF of being behind some of the violence last week.
Prices have increased for fuel and some consumer goods, while taxes on cars, phone calls, the internet, hotel accommodation and other items have also gone up.
Tunisia has been hailed as the only democratic success of the Arab Spring: the one Arab country to topple a long-serving leader in that year's uprisings without triggering widespread violence or civil war. 

But Tunisia has had nine governments since Ben Ali's overthrow, none of which have been able to resolve deep-rooted economic problems. The economy has worsened since a vital tourism sector was nearly wiped out by a wave of deadly militant attacks in 2015, and has yet to recover despite improved security.

None of the 168 people on board was hurt in the incident, but passengers spoke of panic as the aircraft tipped nose first towards the sea.
Just after the flight from Ankara landed at the Black Sea city of Trabzon there was a loud noise, Fatma Gordu was quoted as saying by the state-run Anadolu news agency.
""We tilted on the side and the front of the plane went down and the back of went up,"" she said. ""There was a huge panic, people were shouting.""
When the plane came to a halt in thick mud, passengers smelt fuel. 
""We thought there would be fire,"" Gordu said. ""People panicked - there were pregnant women and children.""
Video on social media showed fire crews pumping water over the plane on Saturday night. 
""It was a miracle,"" said another passenger, Yuksel Gordu. ""We could have burned, we could have exploded or we could have gone into the sea.""
Trabzon governor Yucel Yavuz said all passengers were safely taken off the plane and some had gone to hospital as a precaution. ""They were all OK,"" he told Anadolu.

Pegasus Airlines said in a statement that the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 aircraft ""had a runway excursion incident"" as it landed but the 162 passengers, two pilots and four cabin crew were unhurt.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2018 05:43PM ET</span>","Exclusive: France expects UK to pay up, take more refugees to keep border - official","By Matthias Blamont
PARIS (Reuters) - France expects Britain to agree to take more asylum seekers and pay more for border security in order to maintain a frontier on the French side of the Channel, a French government official said. 
Britain's border was extended into France under a 2003 bilateral treaty known as the Le Touquet accord. But a migration crisis and the Brexit vote to leave the European Union have made the arrangement an increasing source of friction.
The deal will be on the table on Thursday when President Emmanuel Macron holds talks with British Prime Minister Theresa May at a Anglo-French summit in southern England.
Asked if concrete announcements are expected at the talks, the source said: ""Yes. But is it all finalised? Absolutely not.""
France's Interior Minister Gerard Collomb, who has taken the lead on talks, was quoted by the Le Parisen newspaper on Sunday saying he hoped an ""additional protocol"" to supplement the Le Touquet accord could be agreed upon. 
His comments indicated Macron has dropped a campaign promise to renegotiate the Le Touquet accord in full.
""We're still negotiating. There is back and forth. Nothing is locked in yet. The British have shaken on nothing but there's a lot of pressure on them,"" said the official familiar with Collomb's thinking.
If no deal can be struck, France could tear up the Le Touquet accord and the two countries would have to reinstate borders on each side of the English Channel, the source said, adding that this was not in the interest of either side.
""Our understanding is that they will pay more. The question is how much and for what,"" said the source, adding that the two sides are in daily contact ahead of the summit.
""We have let them know of our needs and a figure, we're talking tens of millions of euros."" 
Some pro-Brexit lawmakers from Britain's ruling Conservative party have branded suggestions London pay more as ""absurd"".
A spokesman for the British Home Office (interior ministry) said: ""We work closely with the French authorities at all levels to reduce migrant pressures and target criminal gangs involved in people trafficking, both in northern France and further afield."" 
DETENTION CENTER, REPATRIATIONS
Macron will travel to Britain two days after visiting the northern port city of Calais, the final stopping point for migrants striving to cross the English Channel.
Calais has borne the brunt of the migration crisis in France and at its peak up to 10,000 migrants squatted in a sprawling camp dubbed ""The Jungle"", before former president Francois Hollande sent in bulldozers. 
Paris has complained that it shoulders too much of the financial burden and handles more than its share of asylum cases, while Macron said in 2016 before becoming president that there would be no migrants in Calais if the accord unraveled.
Britain had paid 140 million euros ($171 million) in the past three years toward border and security infrastructure, but that this needed to be increased in the future, the official, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Other options included Britain co-financing a detention center for illegal migrants, organizing repatriation flights and assisting with expulsions, the source said.
France is also asking for legal provisions to ensure Britain accepts more refugees, the official said, adding that it could take more unaccompanied minors under the terms of EU rules.
Macron has come under fire over legislation his government is drafting to speed up the processing of asylum demands and help it expel illegal migrants who do not have a legitimate cause for refugee status.

Images broadcast by television station Canal N showed Fujimori, 79, waving his hand from the inside of a truck upon arriving at the Centenario clinic in Lima together with his son Kenji.
Fujimori had previously been hospitalized from late December through Jan. 5 for heart problems, including high blood pressure and arrhythmia.
""He is going to have some checks done because although he has progressed favorably these seven days, he is not totally stable. He has short periods of arrhythmia,"" his lead doctor, Alejandro Aguinaga, told El Comercio.

President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski cited Fujimori's health in pardoning him for convictions on human rights violations and graft charges less than halfway through a 25-year prison sentence. Kuczynski's decision, which was widely seen as a political maneuver to avoid being ousted by Congress, triggered cabinet resignations and large protests.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",FCC says appears Hawaii had no safeguard to stop missile scare,"By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Hawaii apparently did not have adequate safeguards in place to prevent a false emergency alert about a missile attack that panicked residents for more than a half-hour before it was withdrawn, a federal official said on Sunday.
Speaking after Saturday's errant ballistic missile warning to Hawaii residents, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said government officials must work to prevent future incidents. The FCC ""will focus on what steps need to be taken to prevent a similar incident from happening again,"" he said. 
Officials at all government levels need to work together ""to identify any vulnerabilities to false alerts and do what’s necessary to fix them.""
The alert, sent to mobile phones and broadcast on television and radio shortly after 8 a.m. local time, was issued amid raised tensions over North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons and missiles. 
The message, which was not corrected for 38 minutes, stated: “EMERGENCY ALERT BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.” 
""The false emergency alert sent yesterday in Hawaii was absolutely unacceptable,"" Pai said. ""It caused a wave of panic across the state ... Moreover, false alerts undermine public confidence in the alerting system and thus reduce their effectiveness during real emergencies.""
Corrections should be ""issued immediately in the event that a false alert does go out,"" Pai said. The FCC probe so far suggests Hawaii did not have ""reasonable safeguards or process controls in place.""
The FCC has jurisdiction over the wireless alerts and has proposed technical upgrades to precisely target them to communities. It plans to vote on revisions to the alert system later this month.
Hawaii Governor David Ige said on Saturday he was ""angry and disappointed"" over the incident, apologized for it and said the state would take steps to ensure it never happens again.
Ige said the alert was sent during an employee shift change at the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency and that the state had no automated process to get out the word that it was a false alarm. “An employee pushed the wrong button,” Ige said.
Senator Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, spoke to Pai on Saturday and praised him for working ""with us on developing best practices on the communications side for states and municipalities to make sure this never happens again. This system failed miserably, and we need to start over.""
A 2013 government audit found the Federal Emergency Management Agency has improved a federal alerting system known as the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System, ""but barriers remain to fully implementing an integrated system.""
The system can receive and authenticate internet-based alerts from state and local government agencies and disseminate them to the public.

Some states were reluctant to fully implement a system and that ""decreases the capability for an integrated, interoperable, and nationwide alerting system,"" the report said.

The National Liberation Army (ELN) is in the midst of a renewed offensive against the military and oil infrastructure, after the end of a months-long ceasefire amid peace talks to end more than 53 years of war.
The attack, which occurred late on Saturday in Mallama municipality in Narino province, has not affected exports or crude production at fields in the southern jungle zone along the border with Ecuador, Ecopetrol said.
The 306-kilometer (109-mile) Transandino has the capacity to transport 85,000 barrels of crude per day.
The ELN, which has some 2,000 fighters, has killed two police officers and one soldier in attacks since the ceasefire ended on Jan. 9. The group on Saturday kidnapped an Ecopetrol contractor repairing damage to the Cano-Limon pipeline, also bombed by the ELN, the army said.
President Juan Manuel Santos has recalled the head of the government's negotiating team at the peace talks in Quito back to Bogota to discuss the future of talks.

Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali al-Thani has emerged as a potential Qatari opposition figure after a row erupted last year between Qatar and some fellow Gulf Arab states, including the UAE and Saudi Arabia, over allegations that Qatar supports terrorism. Qatar denies the accusation.
Qatari media, including Al Jazeera television, carried a video on Sunday of the silver-bearded Sheikh Abdullah saying that he was being held against his will after coming to Abu Dhabi as a guest.
""I am now in Abu Dhabi as a guest of Sheikh Mohammed, but actually not in the position of a guest but rather as a detainee,"" Sheikh Abdullah said in the recording, apparently referring to Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahayan.
""I just want to inform you that if anything happens to me, don't blame Qatar,"" he added.
The authenticity of the recording could not immediately be verified.
A UAE Foreign Ministry official said Sheikh Abdullah had come to Abu Dhabi at his own request as a guest after the Qatari government placed restrictions on him.
""He is free to move about and has expressed his desire to leave the state, all procedures were facilitated for him without any obstruction,"" the official said in a statement carried by the UAE state news agency WAM, giving no details of his destination.
The official said the claim that Sheikh Abdullah was being held against his will was ""lies"", and blamed Qatar.
Qatar said that the lack of contacts with Abu Dhabi made it difficult to be certain what had happened with Sheikh Abdullah, but that it was monitoring the situation.
""In principle, the state of Qatar supports maintaining the legal rights of any individual and his family has the right to pursue all legal means to protect his rights,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Ali al-Naimi, editor of an online UAE news website who also heads the education department in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, said he had been informed by a reliable source in Abu Dhabi that Sheikh Abdullah had originally moved to the UAE capital, where he has family connections, at his own request, because he feared for his safety in Qatar.
Naimi said he believed the recording had been fabricated by Qatar.
Sheikh Abdullah emerged as a potential opposition figure after the row over Qatar erupted last June, criticizing his cousins in Doha in interviews with Gulf media, and appearing in the company of Saudi officials.

1491,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>",Poland's government reshuffle boosts support for ruling party,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Public support for Poland's ruling conservatives has risen while backing for the biggest opposition party fell as a recent government reshuffle helped ease voters' dissatisfaction with Warsaw's clashes with the EU, an opinion poll showed.
According to the IPSOS poll, concluded on Saturday for the OKO.press news website, public support for the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) has risen to 43 percent, up three percentage points from August and highest ever in IPSOS polls. 
Support for the centrist Civic Platform, which ruled Poland for eight years until 2015 and now accuses PiS of undermining democratic standards, fell to 19 percent from 21 percent. 
Since coming to power in 2015, PiS has increased its influence over the courts and state media, putting Poland on a collision course with the European Union. 
In December the EU executive launched unprecedented action, calling on other member states to prepare to sanction Warsaw if it fails to reverse judicial reforms that Brussels says pose a threat to democracy.
A few weeks later Poland's new Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki fired several senior ministers, including the most controversial, which critics say was a part of a grand plan to ease tensions and win support ahead of coming elections. 
Opposition groups have been losing popularity and last week's debate on a new abortion law highlighted their crisis.
On Wednesday, the lower house of parliament decided to take up work on a bill that would ban abortions in the case of irreversible damage to the foetus, removing the main legal recourse Polish women have to obtain a termination.
It earlier rejected a proposal to liberalize the abortion law, because it failed to attract enough votes from members of opposition parties.
In the 2015 election, PiS received nearly 38 percent of votes. The next general election will be held in 2019.

1492,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2018 01:59PM ET</span>",Israel says it destroyed Gaza attack tunnel under Egyptian border,"By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Maayan Lubell
GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli said on Sunday it had destroyed a cross-border attack tunnel that ran from Gaza into Israel and Egypt dug by Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Palestinian enclave, and that it would destroy all attack tunnels by the year's end.
Residents in Gaza said Israeli jets bombed an area east of the southern town of Rafah, by the Egyptian and Israeli borders, late on Saturday night. Israel confirmed the attack immediately after, but gave no details until Sunday. 
There was no immediate comment from Hamas or Egypt, or any reports of casualties.
Israel says it has developed new means which it has declined to disclose, to find tunnels. Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman lauded the breakthrough in an interview on commercial television news, saying they would all be destroyed by the end of the year.
""By the end of 2018, we will eliminate all the Hamas attack tunnels ... we may even manage to do this sooner, but the task is to destroy them all by the end of the year,"" Lieberman said.
Tensions have risen since President Donald Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy on Dec. 6 by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Gaza militants have launched 18 cross-border rockets or mortar bombs, causing no fatalities or serious injuries in Israel, and 15 protesters and two gunmen have been killed by Israeli fire.
The attacks from Gaza, which Israel has blamed on groups not affiliated with Hamas, have drawn Israeli air strikes, usually on targets that have been evacuated.
""There are those who say the Israeli military attacks sand dunes - that is incorrect,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, addressing criticism from lawmakers who have called for a stronger armed response, told reporters after the tunnel was targeted.
Netanyahu cautioned Hamas that Israel ""will respond with even greater force"" if rocket strikes continue. Israel has said Hamas, as the dominant force in Gaza, bears overall responsibility for any attacks from the enclave.
But Yoav Galant, a member of Netanyahu's security cabinet, said on Army Radio that Israel is ""not looking for confrontation with Hamas"". Nonetheless, he said Israel ""could not abide by a situation in which Israelis are harmed by fire (from Gaza)"".
Colonel Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, described the target hit on Saturday as 1.5 km (one mile)-lone ""terror tunnel"" running the Kerem Shalom border crossing into Israel, and into Egypt.
""It could also have served to transfer terrorists from the Gaza Strip into Egypt in order to attack Israeli targets from Egypt,"" he said. 
Kerem Shalom, the main passage point for goods entering Gaza, was shut down on Saturday before the Israeli attack.
Underground tunnels are used to smuggle in all manner of commercial goods to Gaza, and to bring in weapons for militants from Hamas and other groups. They have also been used by Hamas to launch attacks inside Israel.
During the last Gaza war, in 2014, Hamas fighters used dozens of tunnels to blindside Israel's superior forces. 
The Israeli military said it has destroyed three tunnels in the past two months. 

Israel has been constructing a sensor-equipped underground wall along the 60-km (36-mile) Gaza border, aiming to complete the $1.1 billion project by mid-2019.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The search for survivors of the deadly mudslides in parts of California's Santa Barbara County continued Sunday even as hopes dwindled to find anyone alive, officials said.
""We're still in rescue mode and we still hope to find someone alive, although the chances of that are becoming slim,"" said Justin Cooper, a spokesperson for the multi-agency response team.
The death toll rose to 20 on Sunday with four people still missing, Cooper said.
Another 900 emergency personnel arrived this weekend to join the relief effort conducted by more than 2,100 personnel from local, state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy and the American Red Cross.
The ramped-up rescue effort is in response to urgent requests for additional manpower made earlier in the week.
Heavy rains on Tuesday soaked the area near Montecito, north of Los Angeles, where vegetation had been stripped away by the largest wildfire in California's history last month.
Sodden hillsides gave way, unleashing a torrent of mud, water, uprooted trees and boulders onto the valley below and killing people aged 3 to 89.
The destruction covered 30 square miles (78 square km), according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and forced the partial closure of one of California's most celebrated coastal roads, the heavily used Highway 101.
Officials ordered residents in most of the southeastern corner of Montecito, which is east of Santa Barbara, to leave their homes for what was likely to be one or two weeks.
Many fled to nearby Carpinteria, where local resident Tessa Nash said they were communicating via a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page called Carpinteria Swap, which is usually focused on buying and selling secondhand goods. 
In the last few days, Nash said, it has been carrying information about community-led blood drives and transportation tips.

""We're really joined together,"" she said. ""We're affected here in Carpinteria in the sense that we're taking these people in and a lot of people are out of work because they can't travel. It's a trickle down effect.""

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Merkel could join Macron in Davos for epic clash with Trump,"By Noah Barkin 
BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel is considering joining French President Emmanuel Macron at the World Economic Forum in Davos next week in what could turn into an epic clash of competing world views with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Merkel, who has been struggling to put together a government since a German election in September, had been expected to skip the annual gathering of leaders, CEOs, bankers and celebrities in the Swiss Alps for a third straight year.
But after clinching a preliminary coalition agreement with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) on Friday, German officials said Merkel could travel to Davos after all, possibly setting up a major confrontation with Trump, who is expected to speak on the final day of the forum.
An appearance would signal Merkel's return to the world stage after months of political limbo in which she has avoided the limelight and been dismissed by some in the German and international media as a spent force.
It would also allow her and Macron, who is scheduled to speak at the forum on Jan. 24, two days before Trump, to reaffirm their commitment to reforming the European Union after Britain's decision to leave, and to defend liberal democratic values in the face of Trump's ""America First"" policies.
Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert was coy last week when asked whether she might attend the WEF, which will run from Jan. 23-26 under the banner ""Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World"" and will attract some 60 heads of state and government.
But after clinching a preliminary deal with the SPD, the chances that she could attend appear to have risen. German officials said no final decision had been taken and that Merkel may wait for the outcome of an SPD congress in Bonn next Sunday - where the party will formally decide whether to enter coalition talks with her conservatives - before committing.
Officials at the WEF said they believed Merkel was still considering whether to attend. If she does, it is unlikely that she or Macron would overlap with Trump, who is expected to arrive on the afternoon of Jan. 25.
This year's forum will be opened by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Jan. 23. Britain's Theresa May, Canada's Justin Trudeau and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu are also expected, as well as celebrities such as actress Cate Blanchett and musician Elton John.
Last year's gathering took place in the week leading up to Trump's inauguration and was headlined by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who signaled his readiness to fill the vacuum in global leadership created by America's shift inward.
UNITED IN ANTIPATHY
Since then, Trump has pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade deal with Asian countries, announced a withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and threatened to torpedo an agreement between Western powers and Iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program.
He has stirred fears of conflict with North Korea by engaging in an escalating war of words with its leader Kim Jong Un. Last week, he stirred international outrage by referring to Haiti and African nations as ""shithole countries"", according to members of Congress who attended a meeting in the White House.
On Saturday, some 500 demonstrators marched in the Swiss capital Bern to protest against Trump's plans to attend the WEF.
""There are very few things in the world that unite countries as much as their antipathy towards Trump and what he is doing,"" said Ian Bremmer, president of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, and a regular at Davos.
""In the United States he may have 40 percent who approve of what he's doing. In the Davos crowd it is closer to 5 percent."" 
The visit by Trump will be the first by a U.S. president since Bill Clinton in 2000. He will be accompanied by a large delegation that is expected to include his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Merkel has had a frosty relationship with Trump, who accused her during his campaign for the presidency of ""ruining Germany"" by allowing hundreds of thousands of refugees, many fleeing war in the Middle East, into the country in 2015.
She was hailed in some Western media as the last defender of liberal democratic values after Trump's victory. Since then, the election of Macron, a pro-European centrist who, like Merkel, supports free trade and the global rules-based order, has given her a powerful ally in the confrontation with Trump.
Macron is slated to speak for 45 minutes in the evening of Jan. 24 in Davos, a ski resort in eastern Switzerland.
""My instinct tells me that Macron will go big,"" said Robin Niblett, director of the Chatham House think tank in London. ""He won't just talk about Europe. He will try to take up the mantle of the free world under Europe's wing.""

If he is joined by Merkel, who has made seven appearances at the WEF since becoming chancellor in 2005, that message may resonate even louder.

1495,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>","U.S.-led coalition helps to build new Syrian force, angering Turkey","By Tom Perry and Orhan Coskun
BEIRUT/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The U.S.-led coalition is working with its Syrian militia allies to set up a new border force of 30,000 personnel, the coalition said on Sunday, a move that has added to Turkish anger over U.S. support for Kurdish-dominated forces in Syria.
A senior Turkish official told Reuters the U.S. training of the new ""Border Security Force"" was the reason that the U.S. charge d'affaires was summoned in Ankara last week, and President Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman said the development was worrying and unacceptable. 
The force, whose inaugural class is currently being trained, will be deployed at the borders of the area controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) - an alliance of militias in northern and eastern Syria dominated by the Kurdish YPG.
In an email to Reuters, the coalition's Public Affairs Office confirmed details of the new force reported by The Defense Post. About half the force will be SDF veterans, and recruiting for the other half is under way, the Public Affairs Office said.
The force will deploy along the border with Turkey to the north, the Iraqi border to the southeast and along the Euphrates River Valley, which broadly acts as the dividing line separating the U.S.-backed SDF and Syrian government forces backed by Iran and Russia.
U.S. support for the SDF has put enormous strain on ties with NATO ally Turkey, which views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - a group that has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey and is considered a terrorist group by the European Union, Turkey and the United States.
Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said that Washington ""is taking worrying steps to legitimise this organisation and make it lasting in the region"".
""It is absolutely not possible for this to be accepted,"" he said, adding that Turkey ""will continue its fight against any terrorist organisation regardless of its name and shape within and outside its borders"".
Syria's main Kurdish groups have emerged as one of the few winners of the Syrian war and are working to entrench their autonomy over large parts of northern Syria.
Washington opposes those autonomy plans, even as it has backed the SDF, the main partner for the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Syria.
The coalition said the BSF would operate under SDF command and about 230 individuals were currently undergoing training in its inaugural class.
""Efforts are taken to ensure individuals serve in areas close to their homes. Therefore, the ethnic composition of the force will be relative to the areas in which they serve.
""More Kurds will serve in the areas in northern Syria. More Arabs will serve in areas along the Euphrates River Valley and along the border with Iraq to the south,"" the coalition's Public Affairs Office said.
""A NEW MISSION""
""The base of the new force is essentially a realignment of approximately 15,000 members of the SDF to a new mission in the Border Security Force as their actions against ISIS draw to a close,"" it said.
""They will be providing border security through professionally securing checkpoints and conducting counter-IED operations,"" it said, adding that coalition and SDF forces were still engaging Islamic State pockets in Deir al-Zor province.
IED stands for improvised explosive device.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria fighting Islamic State and has said it is prepared to stay in the country until it is certain Islamic State is defeated, that stabilization efforts can be sustained and there is meaningful progress in U.N.-led peace talks on ending the conflict.

The Syrian government in Damascus has declared the United States an illegal occupation force and its SDF allies as ""traitors"". A top Syrian Kurdish politician told Reuters last week that the United States appeared in no hurry to leave Syria.

Solberg's government of her Conservative Party and the smaller right-wing Progress Party, had negotiated with the Liberals since the start of January for possible inclusion.
Adding the Liberals makes day-to-day governing easier for Solberg, but the three parties together still hold only 80 seats in Norway's 169-seat assembly and need support from the Christian Democrats to pass legislation.

While the Christian Democrats, who hold eight seats, back the prime minister on fiscal matters, they have rejected calls to enter government.

Chiune Suhigara was serving as Japanese consul in Kaunas, then capital of Lithuania, when he disobeyed his superiors and issued Japanese visas to Jews fleeing Nazi-occupied Poland despite his country being a close ally of Nazi Germany.
Abe's visit to Lithuania, the first by a Japanese prime minister, comes as Japan seeks greater cooperation with countries such as China, a former adversary in World War Two, in the face of rising tensions over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
""The courageous and humanitarian action of Mr Sugihara provides us with guidance as to how to we should survive in this world, where rule-of-law-based international order is being challenged in various forms,"" Abe told reporters on Saturday.
Japan had several of its former leaders convicted and executed by an Allied tribunal as war criminals after the end of World War Two.
Both China and South Korea have called on Japan to face up to its wartime past after Abe sent an offering to a shrine to war dead last August, the anniversary of Japan's surrender. [http://reut.rs/2AYYGnm]
Sugihara was named as ""Righteous among the Nations"" by Israel's Yad Vashem museum among some 22,000 people honored for helping Jews avoid death in the Nazi Holocaust.
He issued thousands of Japanese transit visas to Jewish refugees in July and August 1940, opening a route for them to escape through Russia to Japan. His diplomatic career was cut short after the war and his actions remained largely unknown in Japan for decades after the conflict ended. 

Most of Lithuania's Jewish population – about 200,000 people – were shot dead in first few months after Nazi Germany occupied its territory in June 1941, ending centuries of the thriving culture.

Last year, Henry Bolton was the fourth leader in a year to be appointed to the helm of UKIP, a party which helped bring about a Brexit vote. He hit the tabloid newspapers over Christmas when they reported that he had left his wife for 25-year-old model and UKIP member Jo Marney.
The Mail on Sunday published a series of messages sent by Jo Marney to a friend in which she made offensive comments about Markle and black people. The newspaper also published an apology from Marney, who said her comments had been ""taken out of context"".
UKIP's Bill Etheridge, a member of the European Parliament, said: ""The time has come for Henry Bolton to resign as leader of UKIP. He must go, he must go quickly, he must go as quietly as possible.""
""It appears to me that the lack of experience in politics from Henry has got the better of him,"" he said in a video statement, describing the last few months as ""hell"" for the party.
Peter Whittle, UKIP's member of the London Assembly, also criticized the remarks, saying they were ""disgraceful"".
""This person should not just be suspended from @UKIP but expelled altogether,"" he said on Twitter.
Led by Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, UKIP won nearly 4 million votes in 2015, 12.6 percent of those cast, on its anti-European Union platform, putting it at the forefront of British politics even though it managed to win one seat in parliament.

But its fortunes have sunk since, hurt by internal fights over its future direction. At last year's election in June, UKIP won 1.8 of the vote.

The dispute over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), as it is formally known, has persisted for nearly three decades and has held up its prospects of joining the European Union.
Greece has challenged the name since Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, saying it implies territorial claims to a Greek province of the same name.
It has only agreed that the country be referred to internationally as ""FYROM"" until the row is resolved. That is the name under which it was admitted to the United Nations in 1993.
The two neighbors have agreed to form working groups led by foreign ministers to hold talks on a solution. They are hoping for progress in talks with a U.N. mediator on Jan. 17.
Greek government officials have suggested that Athens would try to focus on brokering an agreement that calls for a compound name with a geographical qualifier.
However, a nationwide survey conducted by Marc pollsters last week for the Proto Thema newspaper asked if Greece should agree on a compound name including the term ""Macedonia"", with 68 percent responding ""no"" and 23.6 percent ""yes"".
Greeks are highly sensitive about the name issue and rallies are planned in Athens and in northern Greece in the coming weeks against any compromise that might retain the name Macedonia.
Macedonia is also the name of Greece's largest province and of the ancient northern Greek kingdom ruled by Alexander the Great.
Deputy Foreign Minister George Katrougalos said on Sunday that the government was aiming for resolution to the name issue ""with national unity"". 
""The solution that we will bring to parliament will be accepted not only by the two government partners but much more broadly,"" he said.

1500,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",German SPD leaders aim to improve on coalition deal with Merkel,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Leading members of Germany's Social Democrats vowed on Sunday to press for improvements to a coalition blueprint they have agreed with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, seeking to win over skeptical party members who can torpedo the agreement.
Social Democrat (SPD) leaders must sell the deal to party members before a congress on Jan. 21 at which delegates vote on the agreement, clinched on Friday after 25 hours of exploratory talks. Only then can they move ahead with formal negotiations.
""Negotiations are a different ball game to exploratory talks,"" Malu Dreyer, premier in the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate and an SPD deputy leader, told Funke Mediengruppe.
""We will try to achieve more successes in the coalition negotiations,"" she added.
An opinion poll conducted on Friday and published on Sunday showed 56 percent of Germans welcomed the coalition blueprint, agreed after talks between Merkel's conservatives and two smaller parties collapsed in November.
The survey by pollster Emnid for newspaper Bild am Sonntag showed 60 percent of Germans believed the SPD congress should give the go-ahead for coalition negotiations, with 30 percent opposed.
Rank-and-file SPD members are still feeling bruised after the party's worst election result last September since 1933.
Party leaders have their work cut out to persuade the delegates to give them the go-ahead for formal negotiations on forming a renewed version of their 2013-2017 ""grand coalition"" with Merkel's conservatives.
The party's membership, in a contrary mood after the slump in the SPD vote in the Sept. 24 national election, is wary of its leaders' calls for the party to step up for the sake of Germany's stability.
On Saturday, delegates at a regional party conference in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt voted 52-51 against pursuing negotiations on a grand coalition despite an impassioned plea by former party leader Sigmar Gabriel to back the deal.
Some in the wary SPD rank-and-file believe the coalition blueprint lacks sufficient concessions to the center-left party.
The 28-page document is sprinkled with pledges - on strengthening the European Union, on supporting refugees, on tax and pensions - designed to appeal to the more radical membership.
But most fall far short of what the SPD campaigned for in the election. A tax hike for the wealthy or the establishment of parity between private and public healthcare were absent from the document thrashed out with Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and her still more conservative Bavarian CSU allies.
""The exploratory talks laid a foundation, not more, not less,"" Thorsten Schaefer-Guembel, another senior SPD official, told Bild am Sonntag.
""There must be more substance in the coalition agreement so that the distinction is more visible that we are co-governing.""

Francis, a keen defender of the rights of migrants, was addressing a congregation including migrants and refugees from some 50 countries, whose flags festooned the area around the altar in St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican.
""Local communities are sometimes afraid that the newly arrived will disturb the established order, will ""steal"" something they have long laboured to build up,"" he said, while ""the newly arrived ... are afraid of confrontation, judgement, discrimination, failure.""
""Having doubts and fears is not a sin. The sin is to allow these fears to determine our responses, to limit our choices, to compromise respect and generosity, to feed hostility and rejection."" 
As politicians and civil society grapple with the mass movement of people around the world, with flashpoints including in the Mediterranean, and between Myanmar and Bangladesh, the pope has repeatedly urged support for those who migrate.
Argentina-born Francis, who was the first non-European elected to the post in nearly 1,300 years, has criticized President Donald Trump's stated intention to build a wall to stop illegal migrants crossing the U.S. border with Mexico.
The leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics also met Muslim refugees in Myanmar and Bangladesh last year and called for decisive action to solve political problems that cause many to flee.
On Sunday, he said newcomers must ""know and respect the laws, the culture and the traditions of the countries that take them in"".

Communities, meanwhile, have ""to open themselves without prejudices to (newcomers') rich diversity, to understand the hopes and potential of the newly arrived as well as their fears and vulnerabilities"".

The stricken tanker, called the Sanchi (IMO:9356608), which had been adrift and on fire following the accident with the freighter CF Crystal, had ""suddenly ignited"" around noon (0400 GMT), China Central Television (CCTV) said. 
""Currently it has already sunk,"" CCTV said, citing the Shanghai maritime search and rescue center. It showed video of a tower of billowing black smoke that it said reached as high as 1,000 meters, and flames on the surface of the water. The ship sank before 5 p.m. (0900 GMT), the broadcaster said. 
China's State Oceanic Administration said that because the hull of the ship had detonated, a large amount of oil in surrounding waters was on fire, according to the official Xinhua news agency. 
The Administration said it would expand the scope of its monitoring and ""quickly ascertain the spread and drift of overflowing oil"" from the wrecked ship.
A Chinese salvage team on Saturday recovered two bodies from the tanker. Another body, presumed to be one of the Sanchi's sailors, was found on Monday and brought to Shanghai for identification.
The Sanchi's crew consisted of 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis.
Iranian officials said the remaining 29 crew members and passengers of the tanker were presumed dead. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani sent messages of condolence to the families of the crew and called for an investigation into the accident, Iranian state media reported.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi earlier told his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif by telephone that ""as long as there is 1 percent of hope, China will continue to make 100 percent effort"" to rescue and recover the crew.
The tanker, owned by National Iranian Tanker Co, was carrying almost 1 million barrels of condensate, an ultra-light crude oil, to South Korea.

It collided with the CF Crystal (IMO:9497050), which was carrying grain from the United States, about 160 nautical miles (184 km) off China's coast near Shanghai.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis starts a trip to Chile and Peru on Monday, attempting to inject new confidence in the staunchly Catholic countries where the Church's credibility has been severely damaged by sexual abuse scandals.
On his visit to Peru, the second leg of the Jan. 15-22 tour, Francis will also find a destabilizing political corruption crisis has reopened wounds from one of the country's darkest periods of human rights abuses.
In Chile, where the Argentine pope arrives on Monday night, Catholics have planned daily protests against his 2015 appointment of Bishop Juan Barros to head the small diocese of Osorno, a small city south of the Chilean capital.
Barros has been accused of protecting his former mentor, Father Fernando Karadima, whom a Vatican investigation in 2011 found guilty of abusing teenage boys over many years. Karadima has denied the allegations and Barros said he was unaware of any wrongdoing.
The situation for the Church was complicated last week by the leak in Chile of a 2015 letter from the pope to local bishops showing that the Vatican had planned to ask Barros to take a one-year leave at the end of his previous post in 2014. That plan went awry and Barros was appointed to Osorno.
""The Church in Chile, which during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet enjoyed great prestige for its courageous defence of justice and human rights, has today lost much of its credibility with public opinion,"" wrote papal biographer Andrea Tornielli.
A poll by Santiago-based think tank Latinobarometro this month showed that the number of Chileans calling themselves Catholics fell to 45 percent last year, from 74 percent in 1995.
The pope will meet victims of the Pinochet dictatorship, which lasted from 1973 to 1990.
Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said the Church had ""maximum respect"" for those planning to protest against sexual abuse and did not exclude the possibility that the pope would meet victims privately, as he has on past trips.
CHURCHES ATTACKED, POPE WARNED
There have been a series of attacks on Catholic churches in the capital ahead of the pope's visit, including one with a home-made bomb where unidentified vandals left a pamphlet reading ""Pope Francis, the next bomb will be in your robe"".
No one has been injured and no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks.
Abuse scandals will also cast a shadow on the pope's stop in Peru, where he arrives on Thursday.
Last week Francis ordered the Vatican takeover of an elite Catholic society in Peru. The society's founder is accused of sexually and physically abusing children and former members of the group.
Political corruption and human rights are also likely to be in focus in a country divided over former autocrat leader Alberto Fujimori, whose pardon from prison by the current president has sparked national protests.
Fujimori, 79, had served less than half of a 25-year sentence for corruption and human rights crimes for commanding death squads to combat a Maoist-inspired insurgency during his 1990-2000 right-wing populist government.
During a previous trip to Latin America Francis called corruption ""the plague, it's the gangrene of society"".
A common thread linking the two countries is the pope's defense of indigenous people.
On Tuesday he flies south to Temuco in Chile's Araucania region, home of the Mapuche, who accuse the state and private companies of taking their ancestral land, stripping it of natural resources and of using heavy handed enforcement against their communities.
    President Michelle Bachelet last year asked for forgiveness from the Mapuche community for such ""errors and horrors"". 
In Peru, Francis will visit the Amazonian town of Puerto Maldonado where the indigenous people - including reclusive tribes that shun contact with outsiders - face risks ranging from wildcat gold mining, illegal logging and drug trafficking.
""Their territory is increasingly being invaded, their space is becoming smaller and smaller; the livelihoods with which they have survived for so many centuries are being destroyed,"" Father Manuel Jesus Romero told the newsletter of REPAM, a Pan-Amazonian Church Network.

There has been widespread speculation that Ramaphosa and his allies are lobbying ANC members to oust Zuma as head of state in the coming weeks, but he made no mention of Zuma's future in a closely watched speech on Saturday.
Ramaphosa won the race to succeed Zuma as ANC leader last month, narrowly defeating former cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Zuma's ex-wife, in a bitter leadership contest that had threatened to split the 106-year-old ANC.
In the interview to South Africa's eNCA television station, Ramaphosa said the issue of whether the ANC would push for Zuma to step down as president ""will be dealt with, you know, as time goes on"".
Ramaphosa said Zuma was a ""deployee of the ANC"" and that the ANC ""dictates to all of us"". He added that he knew South African people were impatient for change but that ""we should not humiliate President Zuma.""
Zuma himself orchestrated the removal of former president Thabo Mbeki in 2008 once he had succeeded Mbeki as ANC leader.
Zuma's presidency, tainted by corruption accusations which he denies, has tarnished the image of Africa's oldest liberation movement and seen the economy slow to a near-standstill.
Markets have rallied since Ramaphosa's election as ANC leader in December, as investors have warmed to his promises to root out corruption and kick-start economic growth.
Any sign that Zuma could step down before his second presidential term ends in 2019 has tended to lift South African assets, including the rand currency.

DUBAI/JEDDAH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, detained for over two months in an anti-corruption crackdown, is negotiating a possible settlement with authorities but so far has not agreed on terms, a senior Saudi official said.
Prince Alwaleed, whose net worth has been estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion, is chairman and owner of international investment firm  Kingdom  Holding (SE:4280), and one of the country's most prominent businessmen.
""He offered a certain figure but it doesn’t meet the figure required from him, and until today the attorney-general hasn’t approved it,"" the official said on condition of anonymity under government briefing rules.
A second source familiar with Prince Alwaleed's case told Reuters on Saturday that the price had offered to make a ""donation"" to the Saudi government, which would avoid any admission of wrongdoing, and to do so from assets of his own choosing. The government refused those terms, the source said.
Kingdom Holding's share price jumped as much as 9.8 percent on Sunday in response to news of the negotiations, adding about $860 million to the company's capitalization. The stock price was still 7 percent below its level just before Prince Alwaleed was detained.
Since early November Prince Alwaleed has been held, with dozens of other members of Saudi Arabia's political and business elite detained in the crackdown, in Riyadh's opulent Ritz Carlton hotel as authorities seek to reach settlements with the detainees.
Saudi officials say they aim to claw back some $100 billion of funds that rightfully belong to the state. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who launched the crackdown, has indicated he wants to close existing cases quickly and expects most suspects to cut a deal.
The allegations against Prince Alwaleed include money laundering, bribery and extorting officials, a Saudi official told Reuters soon after his detention. Neither he nor his company has commented publicly on the charges.
Kingdom Holding, which has said it is continuing to operate normally, did not respond to requests for comment when asked about any settlement talks.
Construction giant Saudi Binladin Group said on Saturday that some of its shareholders might transfer part of their holdings to the state in a settlement with authorities. Chairman Bakr Bin Laden and several family members were detained in the crackdown.

In late November, senior Saudi Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, once seen as a leading contender to the throne, was freed after reaching a settlement with authorities that involved paying more than $1 billion, according to a Saudi official.

In an interview with Britain's Observer newspaper, Farage, former head of the euroskeptic UK Independence Party, said a well-organized and funded group of campaigners that wants to remain in the EU was drowning out those who want to leave.
""The Remain side are making all the running,"" said Farage. ""They have a majority in parliament, and unless we get ourselves organized we could lose the historic victory that was Brexit.""
Last week, Farage said he was warming to the idea of holding a second vote on Britain's membership of the EU to settle the argument - an idea written off by other Brexit campaigners who urged the government to press on with exit talks with the bloc.
In 2016, Britons voted 52 to 48 percent in favor of ending its membership of the EU. Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out a second referendum, saying her government was seeking an amicable divorce with the EU which will safeguard the economy and enable Britain to secure trade deals with other countries.
But some Brexit campaigners fear her approach has led to the watering down of several of their demands, including the ability to reduce immigration and to reclaim sovereignty by leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.
Several pro-EU campaigners say the need for a second referendum has become more pressing because public opinion is showing some signs of turning against Brexit as the difficulty of negotiations to leave the bloc becomes increasingly clear.

On Thursday, a ComRes poll for the Daily Mirror newspaper of 1,049 adults showed that although more people think there should not be a second referendum (51 to 43 percent), if there were to be a re-run, voters say they would opt to stay in the EU by 55 to 45 percent.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - About 1,500 people are being evacuated from an island off the northern coast of Papua New Guinea (PNG) after a nearby volcano erupted, the local Red Cross said on Sunday.
A volcano on the island of Kadovar, located about 24 km (15 miles) north of the Papuan mainland, began erupting on Jan. 5. That prompted the evacuation of 590 people on Kadovar to the nearby island of Blup Blup. 
After venting ash for several days, the volcano exploded on Friday, blasting out glowing red rocks and sulphur dioxide, the Rabaul Volcanological Observatory said in a bulletin. The PNG government then decided to evacuate Blup Blup as well because of issues with supplying people on the island along with the danger from the eruption. 
The evacuees are being moved to the mainland and the International Red Cross is providing about 87,000 kina ($26,274) in funding to help them, said PNG Red Cross Secretary General Uvenama Rova by telephone from the capital of Port Moresby.
""The people there, as the volcano erupted, they rushed immediately to escape. So they are in immediate need of food, water, shelter and clothing as well,"" he said.
In the latest bulletin issued on Sunday, the Observatory said a dome of lava on Kadover was visible in the sea at the base of thick white steam clouds that are rising to 600 meters (1,969 feet) above sea level.
Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced on twitter that the Australian Government was contributing A$25,000 ($19,775) worth of humanitarian supplies for those affected.
There are no confirmed records of a previous eruption of Kadovar, said Chris Firth, a vulcanologist at Macquarie University, but scientists speculate it could have been one of two ""burning islands"" mentioned in the journals of a 17th-century English pirate and maritime adventurer, William Dampier.

DHAKA/YANGON (Reuters) - Hamid Hussain, a 71-year-old Rohingya Muslim farmer, first fled Myanmar for Bangladesh in 1992. He went home the next year under a repatriation deal between the two neighbors, only to repeat the journey last September when violence flared once more.
Officials from Myanmar and Bangladesh meet on Monday to discuss how to implement another deal, signed on Nov. 23, on the return of more than 650,000 Rohingya who have escaped an army crackdown since late August. Hussain is one of many who say they fear this settlement may be no more permanent than the last.
""Bangladesh authorities had assured us that Myanmar would give us back our rights, that we would be able to live peacefully,"" said Hussain, who now lives in a makeshift refugee camp in southeast Bangladesh.
""We went back but nothing changed. I will go back again only if our rights and safety are guaranteed - forever.""
Buddhist-majority Myanmar has for years denied Rohingya citizenship, freedom of movement and access to many basic services such as healthcare and education. They are considered illegal immigrants from mainly Muslim Bangladesh.
The authorities have said returnees could apply for citizenship if they can show their forebears have lived in Myanmar. But the latest deal - like the one in 1992 - does not guarantee citizenship and it is unclear how many would qualify.
Monday's meeting in Myanmar's capital Naypyitaw will be the first for a joint working group set up to hammer out the details of the November repatriation agreement. The group is made up of civil servants from both countries.
Two senior Bangladesh officials who are involved in the talks acknowledged that much was left to be resolved and it was unclear when the first refugees could actually return. One of the key issues to be worked out was how the process for jointly verifying the identities of returnees would work, they said.
""Any return is chaotic and complex,"" said Shahidul Haque, Bangladesh's top foreign ministry official who will lead Dhaka's 14-member team in the talks. ""The challenge is to create an environment conducive for their return.""
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay said returnees would be able to apply for citizenship ""after they pass the verification process"". 
Zaw Htay added that Myanmar had proposed that a group of 500 Hindus who fled to Bangladesh and have already agreed to be repatriated, alongside 500 Muslims, could form the first batch of returnees.
""The first repatriation is important - we can learn from the experiences, good or bad,"" he said.
MYANMAR SETS UP CAMPS
Bangladesh officials said they would begin the process this month by sharing with Myanmar authorities a list of 100,000 Rohingya, picked at random from among registered refugees.
Haque said Myanmar officials would vet the names against their records of residents before the August exodus, and those approved would then be asked if they wanted to go back.
Refugees without documents would be asked to identify streets, villages and other landmarks near their former homes as proof of their right to return, said Haque.
A Myanmar agency set up to oversee repatriation said in a statement on Thursday that two temporary ""repatriation and assessment camps"" and one other site to accommodate returnees had been set up.
Myint Kyaing, permanent secretary at Myanmar's Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population, told Reuters earlier this month Myanmar would be ready to begin processing least 150 people a day through each of the two camps by Jan. 23. 
As well as checking their credentials as residents of Myanmar, he said, authorities would check returnees against lists of suspected ""terrorists"".
Myint Kyaing declined to comment on how long the repatriation would take but conceded the process after the 1992 agreement had taken more than 10 years.
United Nations agencies working in the camps clustered around Cox's Bazar, in southeastern Bangladesh, have voiced scepticism about the resettlement plans.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration said their offers to help with the process have not been taken up by the two countries.
""Further measures are needed to ensure safe, voluntary and sustainable repatriation of refugees to their places of origin and to address the underlying root causes of the crisis,"" said Caroline Gluck, a spokeswoman for the UNHCR in Cox's Bazar.
The UNHCR says refugees it has surveyed want guarantees that international agencies will be involved in overseeing the process and more information about the security situation in their home areas.
WHO WILL GO? WHO WILL PAY?
While many Rohingya say they want to go back to Myanmar, most of the more than a dozen who spoke to Reuters said they were scared to do so now.
""I am not going back. No one's going back,"" said Hafizulla, a 37-year-old Rohingya man. ""We are scared to go back without any U.N. intervention. They can accuse us later, they can arrest us. They may accuse us of helping the militants.""
The military offensive the refugees fled, which was prompted by Rohingya insurgent attacks on police and army posts, has been described by the United States and U.N. as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar rejects that, saying troops did not target civilians.
""You can have all the agreements in the world, and set up all the reception centers and everything, but it won't make a difference unless the conditions in Myanmar are such that people feel confident that they can go back and live in peace, and have equal rights,"" said a Western diplomat in Dhaka.
The second Bangladesh official, Refugee Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner Mohammed Abul Kalam, said the ""Rohingyas' reluctance to go back"" was an issue that needed to be addressed.
He said the repatriation process would cost ""millions of dollars"" but funding details had not yet been agreed and were not expected to be discussed at Monday's meeting. 

Japan, one of Myanmar's biggest aid donors, said on Friday it was giving an emergency grant of around $3 million to help with the return of the Rohingya.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Foreign-based members of Cambodia's dissolved opposition party have launched a movement to demand the release of its detained leader and to call for free and fair elections and possibly protests.
The Supreme Court dissolved the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in November at the request of the government of long serving Prime Minister Hun Sen.
Party leader Kem Sokha was arrested in September and is accused of trying to overthrow the government with American help and of espionage — charges he denies and says are politically motivated ahead of a general election in July.
Former CNRP leader Sam Rainsy said in a tweet on Sunday that the Cambodia National Rescue Movement (CNRM), launched on Saturday, would provide a new structure that nobody can harm or dissolve. 
""The CNRM can launch appeals to the people to organize peaceful protests, to workers to go on strike and to the armed forces to side with the people,"" Sam Rainsy tweeted, along with a statement.
Sam Rainsy, a former CNRP leader who lives in exile in France, did not say it was calling for any protests at this point. It was not immediately clear how widespread the backing for the new movement was among CNRP members.
According to the statement, the CNRM's members include Sam Rainsy, his wife Saumura Tioulong and deputy presidents of the now dissolved CNRP, Eng Chhai Eang and Mu Sochua.
""We invite our compatriots from all walks of life, regardless of their political affiliation, to join the CNRM in order to protect the will of the Cambodian people through free, fair and inclusive elections,"" the statement said.
They said in the statement that they also demand the release of Kem Sokha and other politician prisoners of conscience.
Huy Vannak, undersecretary of state at the Interior Ministry, called the movement ""desperate"" and that Sam Rainsy is ""a serial loser.""
""I advise the people on this list about the spirit of the Cambodian Supreme Court's decision on the prohibition of political rights and to avoid taking illegal or guerrilla acts leading to the harm of innocents and the destruction of Cambodians,"" he said.
The Supreme Court's decision also banned more than 118 CNRP members from politics ahead of the general election on July 29.

Rights groups have decried an ongoing crackdown against the political opposition and independent media. One group called the CNRP's dissolution the death of democracy in the country.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The airport for the Australian city of Newcastle has canceled flights for the second time in 24 hours because of bushfires in the area, operator Newcastle Airport said on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Sunday.
The airport, located just outside of the city in the town of Port Stephens, is scheduled the reopen on Monday, Newcastle Airport said, while urging passengers to check with airlines regarding the status of their flights.
The shutdown affected Jetstar Australia and Virgin Australia along with regional airlines Regional Express and FlyPelican.
The airport closed on Saturday as well because of thick smoke.
Strong winds fanned the flames on Sunday afternoon prompting the New South Wales Rural Fire Service to issue emergency warnings on Twitter for residents to seek shelter as spot fires flared to the north of the airport's runway.
Newcastle Airport, Australia's 12th busiest airport, handled 1.26 million passengers in the year ending June 30 2017, it says on its website.

Saying they had made strides but needed more time, the parties announced another round of talks to begin in the Dominican Republic on Jan. 18. 
The result prolongs the standoff between the government and the opposition, who have tried and failed for years to strike a pact. The two sides last met for talks in December.
Nevertheless, Dominican President Danilo Medina, who led the negotiations, expressed optimism about the progress made during the round. 
""Although we have made extremely important advances, we still have pending matters that must be discussed,"" he said at a press conference following the end of the talks. 
Representatives from Bolivia, Chile, Mexico and Nicaragua also participated in the discussions.
The parties did not detail where they had made progress. 
As millions of Venezuelans grapple with shortages of food and basic goods, the opposition leaders are demanding that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro accept humanitarian assistance from abroad, in addition to releasing several hundred jailed political activists.
""These days and hours of intense work are not enough to achieve what our people, the Venezuelan people, need to have an avenue, a path of hope,"" said Julio Borges, who is the president of the country's National Assembly that is controlled by the opposition, at the press conference.

Abadi, a Shi'ite Muslim who led the country in the four-year war against Islamic State, said he will seek to form a cross-sectarian block called ''the victory alliance'' to contest the parliamentary elections, with candidates from other communities.
Abadi took over the premiership in 2014 from Nuri al-Maliki, a close ally of Iran widely criticized by Iraqi politicians for the army's collapse as Islamic State militants swept through a third of Iraq.
Maliki, who heads the Shi'ite Dawa party, announced on Saturday he will be running in the elections. 
Abadi is a Dawa member but he didn't secure Maliki's endorsement for his candidacy. Maliki said on Saturday Dawa supporters will be free to choose between his alliance, called ''state of law'', and Abadi's ''victory alliance.''
Abadi is credited for quickly rebuilding the army and defeating Islamic State in its main Iraqi stronghold, Mosul, last July, with strong assistance from a U.S.-led coalition.
Maliki holds the ceremonial title of vice-president. He remains a powerful political figure as head of the Dawa and the largest political block in the current parliament.
The prime minister's office is reserved for Iraq's majority Shi'ite Arab community under a power-sharing system set up after the 2003 U.S-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Arab. 
The largely ceremonial office of president is reserved for a Kurdish member of parliament. The speaker of parliament is drawn from Sunni Arab MPs.
The parliament is yet to approve the May 12 date for the elections.

1521,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>","Philippines raises volcano alert, warns of hazardous eruptions","MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines raised the alert at its restive Mayon volcano by one notch early on Sunday, citing signs of rising magma that could lead to hazardous eruptions.
Residents were evacuated from two villages near the volcano, a tourist attraction in central Albay province because of its near-perfect cone shape, following a ""phreatic or steam-driven eruption"" on Saturday.
The explosion unleashed ash, rocks and sulfuric odor, and was followed by rumbling sounds and a faint glow in the crater, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said in its latest bulletin.
Phivolcs raised the alert to level 2, which means that the current activity is ""probably of magmatic origin, which could lead to more phreatic eruptions or eventually to hazardous magmatic eruptions.""
Mayon's most destructive eruption was in February 1841, when lava flows buried a town and killed 1,200 people. It last erupted in 2014, spewing lava and forcing thousands of people to evacuate.
""The public is strongly advised to be vigilant and desist from entering the six kilometer (3.7 mile) radius Permanent Danger Zone to minimize risks from sudden explosions, rockfall and landslides,"" Phivolcs said.
It advised people experiencing ashfall to cover their noses and mouths with a damp, clean cloth or dust mask. It also said aircraft must avoid flying close to the volcano's summit.
Those within the slope of the volcano, but outside the 6-km danger zone, were told to take precautionary measures against possible roof collapses due to accumulated ash and rainwater.
Phivolcs chief Renato Solidum said the volcano appeared due for another eruption as it has been displaying abnormal behavior since late last year.
But Cedric Daep, head of the Albay Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office, said those in evacuation centers may be allowed to return to their homes later in the day, unless Phivolcs raises the volcano alert level further.
He said not all residents evacuated live inside the 6-km danger zone.
""We have not reached the critical level,"" he said in a radio interview. ""Alert level 3 is what we considered critical, 4 is when eruption is imminent, and 5 is eruption in progress.""

The attorney general's office has launched an investigation to determine the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to Dominguez's work as a journalist, the state said.
Dominguez was an independent journalist who wrote a political column. In one of his last publications, he lamented the growing political violence that has struck Mexico ahead of the presidential election in July.
Francisco García Cabeza de Vaca, the governor of Tamaulipas, denounced the killing in a post on Twitter.
""My condolences to the family of the journalist Carlos Dominguez Rodriguez,"" he wrote. ""My commitment to them and the journalistic community of Tamaulipas is that this murder will not go unpunished.""

1523,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2018 08:07PM ET</span>",Ballistic missile warning sent in error by Hawaii authorities,"By Jolyn Rosa
HONOLULU (Reuters) - An emergency alert was sent mistakenly on Saturday to Hawaii's residents warning of an imminent ballistic missile attack when an employee at the state emergency management agency pushed the ""wrong button,"" Hawaii's governor said.
State officials and the U.S. military's Pacific Command confirmed that there was no actual threat to the state. But for more than a half hour, while the agency struggled to retract the warning, panicked Hawaiians scrambled to find shelter.
The mistaken alert stated: ""EMERGENCY ALERT BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL."" The alert, sent to mobile phones and aired on television and radio shortly after 8 a.m., was issued amid high international tensions over North Korea's development of ballistic nuclear weapons.
Governor David Ige told a news conference he was ""angry and disappointed"" over the incident, apologized for it and said the state would take steps to ensure it never happens again.
""What happened today was totally unacceptable,"" the Democratic governor said.
Ige said the alert was sent during a employee shift change at the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, and that the state had no automated process to get out the word that it was a false alarm. Vern Miyagi, the agency's administrator, called it ""human error.""
""An employee pushed the wrong button,"" Ige said.
Stacey Bow, 56, of Honolulu, said she received the emergency alert on her smart phone. She awakened her 16-year-old daughter with the news. ""She became hysterical, crying, you know, just lost it,"" she said.
Ige said the emergency management agency after the incident ordered a change in its procedures requiring two employees, not just one, to send out such an alert in the future. He said such shift changes occur three times a day every day of the year.
Miyagi, who said Hawaii would have only 12 to 13 minutes of warning in an actual attack, declined to say what action would be taken against the employee. Miyagi said the agency routinely tests its emergency alert system and that employee thought he was conducting a test, not realizing he had transmitted the warning with a two-step process on a computer screen until receiving it on his own cellphone minutes later.
'FEELS TERRIBLE'
""There is a screen that says, 'Are you sure you want to do this?'"" Miyagi said, adding that the employee ""feels terrible about it.""
Miyagi, who took responsibility for the incident, said the mistake ""should have been caught.""
""This will not happen again,"" he added.
Bow said of the person responsible for issuing the alert, ""I imagine that person is clearing out their desk right now. You don't get a do-over for something like that.""
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which has jurisdiction over the emergency alert system, announced it was initiating a full investigation. Earlier this week, FCC chairman Ajit Pai said the agency would vote at its January meeting to enhance the effectiveness of wireless emergency alerts, which have been in place since 2012.
Hawaii, a chain of islands in the Pacific Ocean, has a population of about 1.4 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and is home to Pacific Command, the Navy's Pacific Fleet and other elements of the American military.
Hawaii's economy depends heavily on tourism. At the news conference with Ige and Miyagi, a Hawaii tourism official expressed concern about the impact the incident might have on attracting visitors to the state.
In November, Hawaii said it would resume monthly statewide testing of Cold War-era nuclear attack warning sirens for the first time in at least a quarter of a century, in preparation for a possible missile strike from North Korea.
The governor said some sirens went off on Saturday after the false alarm.
North Korean President Kim Jong-un has threatened to unleash his country's growing missile weapon capability against the U.S. territory of Guam or U.S. states, prompting President Donald Trump to threaten tough action against Pyongyang, including ""fire and fury.""
Trump was wrapping up a round of golf at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida when the incident was unfolding. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said Trump was briefed by aides and that the incident involved ""purely a state exercise.""
Michael Sterling, 56, of Los Angeles, was in Waikiki when he received the alert.
""I was thinking what could we do? There is nothing we can do with a missile,"" Sterling said.
School administrator Tamara Kong, 43, of Honolulu, said, ""Today, the whole state of Hawaii experienced a collective moment of panic and relief.""
The incident could add to the Trump administration's sense of urgency about North Korea's nuclear threat. Some hawks within the administration believe the United States cannot live with a perpetual North Korean threat and that U.S. military force could be necessary. The incident could also give fresh impetus to those advocating a peaceful resolution.

Guterres is on a two-day visit to Colombia to discuss the progress of its peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels and ongoing peace talks with smaller guerrilla group the National Liberation Army (ELN), which recently re-started attacks after a months-long ceasefire.
Venezuelans fleeing acute food shortages, high crime and political unrest have flooded across the border to Colombia in recent years. Some visit just to buy groceries, while others begin lives from scratch, often working informally and without visas. Last year Colombia extended permits for Venezuelans in a humanitarian measure - the government estimates there are some 470,000 Venezuelans in the country.
""I want to manifest all the support of the United Nations to the government and people of Colombia in this humanitarian effort, the reception of all these people, and say that we are even willing to mobilize other international help as is possible,"" Guterres said after meeting with President Juan Manuel Santos, ministers and security officials.

Prosecutors and investigators with the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala said the politician orchestrated an attack on journalists Danilo Efraín Zapón López and Federico Benjamín Salazar Gerónimo, who were killed in March 2015. 
Juarez was arrested on Saturday morning near his home in the southern district of Suchitepéquez and transferred to Guatemala City, the capital of the Central American nation. He maintained his innocence as he reported to court on Saturday afternoon.
""He who owes nothing fears nothing, that's why I'm here in the name of God, who will clear up everything,"" Juarez told reporters. ""Talk to the press of Suchitepéquez and you will realize that I never, never had problems with the press.""
Juarez served as mayor of the southern city of San Antonio La Union from 2012 to 2015, before winning a seat in Congress the next year. According to investigators, Zapon, who was a journalist for the newspaper Prensa Libre, was attacked because he was working on a story about corruption in the Juarez's administration. 
Last December, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Juarez under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act for his alleged role in the attack.
Local media reported in 2015 that Juarez described himself as a friend of Zapon's and admitted to meeting the journalist the day he was killed.

""That's why they want to investigate me, but I am free of any involvement with him,"" Juarez told local media.

""An informed source announced that the filtering of the Telegram messenger has been ended and it is being used by users,"" IRNA reported.
At least 22 people have died and 1,000 people have been arrested in the anti-government protests that began in late December. As the protests ebbed, the government last week lifted restrictions imposed on Instagram, one social media tool used to mobilize protesters. 
But access to the more widely used messaging app Telegram was still blocked, suggesting authorities remained uneasy about the possibility of further protests.
Telegram, with 40 million users in Iran, in late December shut down a channel that Tehran had accused of encouraging violence. But it declined to block other channels, prompting Iranian authorities to block access to the app.
Many Iranians access Telegram using virtual private networks (VPNs) and other tools to bypass government filtering of the Internet, residents said.
But officials said hundreds of companies using the app for their marketing and sales had been hard-hit by the social media restrictions, and President Hassan Rouhani was quoted as saying about 100,000 people had lost their jobs.
Thousands of government supporters have staged rallies in a backlash against the protests, which posed the boldest challenge to the Islamic establishment since widespread unrest in 2009 over alleged election fraud.

Iran continues to impose restrictions on the Internet and social media, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter still blocked.

The operation is part of a joint effort by Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda against the group after the suspected ADF attack on a base manned by Tanzanian peacekeeping troops.
That attack, which also killed five Congolese soldiers and wounded another 53 peacekeepers, came amid a rising wave of violence in the mineral-rich, ethnically volatile area.

Rival militia groups control parts of eastern Congo long after the official end of a 1998-2003 war in which millions of people died, mostly from hunger and disease. 
A surge in militia violence across the country, which followed President Joseph Kabila's refusal to step down when his mandate expired just over a year ago, has raised fears Congo could slide into all-out war again.
The Islamist ADF has long been active along the Congo-Uganda border and has been blamed for a spate of massacres. Last month Uganda launched air strikes and artillery attacks on ADF positions on its side.

On Wednesday the lower house decided to take up work on a bill that would ban abortions in the case of irreversible damage to the foetus, removing the main legal recourse Polish women have to obtain a termination.
Earlier, parliament rejected a proposal to liberalize the abortion rules which allow the procedure only when the mother's health or life are in danger or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.
This is the second bid by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party to tighten rules that are already among Europe's toughest. Its initial plan for a near-total ban on abortion was rejected after mass protests in 2016.
""Except for wombs we also have brains,"" read some of the slogans carried by demonstrators braving a cold night to join the protest organized by a group of leftist movements. 
The conservative PiS, supported by the powerful Catholic Church, has been pushing to enforce religious values in public life, with the party leader and the country's paramount politician, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, long saying that abortions due to damage to a foetus must be outlawed.
""As everyone, I'm here because the government is enforcing solutions that hit women, ignoring women's voice. These changes are being introduced without any consultations,"" said 25-year-old Maja at the protest.

""The parliament decided to continue work on a crazy project, but I am not sure if our protest will change anything,"" said Bogumila, an 18-year-old student.

""The video in question is not official, not authorized and does not represent the professionalism of the service members of U.S. Central Command,"" Air Force Col. John Thomas, a spokesman for the U.S. military Central Command, said in an emailed statement.
""We are conducting an investigation into this video, and will take appropriate actions as a result of this investigation,"" he said.
It was not clear when or where the video was made. The clip, filmed from the perspective of the apparent shooter as they sit in a moving vehicle, shows a civilian truck being overtaken when a shot appears to be fired into its window.
The video, which Thomas said had caused ""serious concern"", comes as the United States has stepped up operations in Afghanistan against both Taliban insurgents and radical fighters from Islamic State and other militant groups.
Commanders have been very sensitive to reports of civilian casualties, mindful of the serious tensions with the Afghan government and public opinion caused by such casualties in previous years.
""I have reviewed the video and I am disappointed and also concerned that the American people, our Coalition partners, the Afghan government, and the Afghan people will believe that American service members are callous and indifferent to the horrors of war or the suffering of innocent people trapped in conflict,"" Gen. Joseph Votel, Commander, U.S. Central Command, said in the emailed statement.
""I can assure you that this video does not represent the professionalism or humanity of the men and women of U.S. Central Command. We reject the unprofessional and callous message this video conveys,"" he said.

1532,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>","Nigerian Shi'ite leader, rumored dead, makes first public appearance in two years","ABUJA (Reuters) - The leader of Nigeria's Shi'ite Muslim sect, rumored to have died in detention, made his first public appearance in two years on Saturday, after police arrested dozens of members of the group during protests calling for his release this week.
Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky, the leader of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), has been imprisoned at an unknown location without charge since December 2015 after his followers clashed with the army in the northern city of Zaria.
A judicial inquiry the following year said 347 IMN members were killed by the military and buried in mass graves.
The violent repression of IMN and detention of Zakzaky, despite a court ruling that he could not be held without charge and should be released, drew accusations of human rights abuses by President Muhammadu Buhari's administration.
In a brief exchange in the capital Abuja, Zakzaky told reporters that authorities had allowed him to see his doctor for treatment of an unspecified condition.
""For the first time at least the security (officers) have allowed me to see my own doctors,"" he said, according to footage of the exchange. ""I am getting better.""
This week, Nigerian social media had been awash with rumors that Zakzaky had died. From Monday to Wednesday, IMN members protested in the capital, with police arresting 52 people without specifying charges.
In 2016, Nigeria's northern state of Kaduna declared IMN - a minority sect in the mainly Sunni Muslim north - unlawful on security grounds, angering its adherents as anyone convicted of being a member could be imprisoned for up to seven years.
The ban triggered a wave of attacks on IMN members, worsening sectarian rivalries in northern Nigeria, where the army is also fighting Boko Haram, Sunni Islamist militants who have killed tens of thousands and caused a humanitarian crisis.
Security analysts have drawn parallels between the Shi'ite group and Boko Haram, whose insurgency began in 2009 after security forces killed hundreds of its members and its leader Mohammed Yusuf died in custody. Zakzaky was badly wounded in the 2015 clashes.
Nigeria, with a population of 190 million, combines a predominantly Christian south and mainly Sunni Muslim north. Shi'ites are estimated at less than 4 million, although there are no official figures. Human Rights Watch estimates that IMN has around 3 million members.
IMN was founded in the 1980s after an Islamic revolution in mainly Shi'ite Iran in 1979, which inspired the sect's founders.

1533,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2018 12:44PM ET</span>",No Grand Coalition! Opponents of Merkel alliance hit the road,"By Thomas Escritt
WERNIGERODE, Germany (Reuters) - Opponents of a renewed German ""grand coalition"" took to the road on Saturday, hoping to persuade members of their Social Democratic Party (SPD) to vote against governing with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives for another four years.
The party's rank-and-file, bruised after seeing the SPD's previous stint as Merkel's junior partner lead to its worst election result since 1933, is wary of its leaders' calls for the party to step up for the sake of Germany's stability.
Leaders of the SPD and the conservative camp thrashed out a 28-page blueprint for a possible ""GroKo"" grand coalition government this week, recommending that their parties hold formal coalition talks.
But at a regional party meeting in Wernigerode, a medieval town of half-timbered buildings at the foot of the thickly forested Harz hills, delegates wrestled with the issue which has split the party down the middle.
""Important demands that the SPD made ahead of the elections are simply not in the document,"" said Kevin Kuehnert, leader of the SPD's Jusos youth wing, who will spend the next week criss-crossing the country arguing for delegates to vote ""No"" to coalition talks at a special party congress next Saturday.
""We Jusos aren't going to make ourselves the servants of a Black (conservative) government that demands deportations or a refugee camp,"" said Florian Luedke, a local youth delegate wearing a ""NoGroKo"" badge, to applause.
Their message resonated at the regional party conference in Wernigerode, where delegates voted 52-51 against pursuing negotiations on a grand coalition. There were four abstentions, the SPD said.
The slump in the SPD vote in the Sept. 24 national election has left the membership in a contrary mood, with many calling for the party to reinvent itself in opposition rather than attempt to implement what they see as thin gruel in the coalition blueprint.
The document is sprinkled with pledges - on strengthening the European Union, on supporting refugees, on tax and pensions - designed to appeal to the more radical membership.
But most fall far short of what the SPD campaigned for in the election. A tax hike for the wealthy or the establishment of parity between private and public healthcare were absent from the document thrashed out with Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and her still more conservative Bavarian CSU allies.
""DAMNED LONELY""
The Jusos are angered particularly by the document containing an aspiration that migration not exceed 220,000 a year, dismissing it as an ""asylum cap by another name"".
The SPD's branch in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's largest state, also opposes a repeat of the coalition. Hit by the decline in the heavy industry that had provided its traditional voter base, it was toppled in the regional government by Merkel's CDU last year.
Even some senior party figures are not completely sold on the idea.
""There is a great deal of scepticism,"" Manuela Schwesig, SPD state premier in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, told NDR Info radio.
Across the country, voters have deserted the SPD for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party or the Left party, formed from the ashes of the former East German Communist party.
Addressing the regional congress in Wernigerode, Social Democrat Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel urged delegates to resist the temptation to lick their wounds in opposition, urging them to use power to give people a reason to vote for them.
""If you never make compromises you'll end up damned lonely, pretty quickly,"" Gabriel said. Only in power can the SPD advance policies that would win it votes, he added.
He praised the deal's commitment to strengthening the EU and tackling youth unemployment across the bloc, saying that in a world where U.S. President Donald Trump was an increasingly unreliable partner and China ever more powerful, social democracy was hard to achieve ""by national means"".
On this, at least, the radical youth wing agreed with him.

""There was lots of social democracy in the first bit on Europe, but after that it stops,"" Luebke said of the coalition blueprint. ""Vote against the Grand Coalition, and look for ways to renew our party.""

Trump announced last week that he would attend the WEF in Davos, an annual meeting of global business and political leaders.
Some have suggested that Trump's polarizing persona could resurrect the violent anti-WEF protests seen in the early 2000s. An online petition is circulating telling Trump he is not welcome.
On Saturday, around 500 anti-globalisation protesters marched peacefully past the Swiss parliament in Bern.
Some were clad in black and carried placards saying ""No future for capitalism"", ""Eat the rich"" and ""Kill Trump"", also setting off flares.

Up to 5,000 Swiss soldiers have been drafted in to guard Davos along with 1,000 police, while a no-fly zone will also be put in place to protect delegates.

Around 20,000 people according to police estimates gathered to protest against the new coalition government which includes the far-right Freedom Party (FPO), which was founded by former Nazis.
The demonstrators included students, leftist groups and pensioners who called themselves Grannies Against The Right and others, carrying placards saying ""Don't Let Nazis Govern."" 
Austrian police said up to 1,000 officers were on duty at the event, which they described as peaceful. 
The gathering called for a boycott of FPO ministers by other European governments and the shunning of Austria when it takes up the revolving European Union presidency in the second half of 2018.
Last month, the FPO entered government as the junior coalition partner to Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's OVP conservatives after a parliamentary election in which both pledged to stop illegal immigration and to fight radical Islam.
Despite the FPO saying it has left its founders' Nazi past behind and denounces anti-Semitism, its opponents still accuse the party of being racist, sexist and anti-Jewish.
""It is very important that Austrian civil society is mobilised. The FPO are not just populists - they are an enemy of democracy,"" said Benjamin Abtan, president of the European Grassroots Anti-Racist Movement, who spoke at the event.
""People don't understand that the FPO is not a regular party, they are extremely radical. They should not have a seat at the top tables in Europe.""
Abtan cited comments from Interior Minister Herbert Kickl of the FPO, who last week said asylum seekers should be ""concentrated"" in special centers to help the authorities process their applications swiftly.
The wording evoked Nazi-era concentration camps and triggered a storm of protest in Austria. 

Senior FPO figure Norbert Hofer on Saturday told Austrian radio that Kickl's comments were not maliciously or consciously meant, and that human rights would be respected in dealing with asylum seekers.

Evidence is being collected against ""fugitives"" in order to issue indictments against them and request that foreign governments return them to the kingdom, Saud al-Muajab told Arrajol magazine in an interview published on Thursday.
It was not clear how many people are being targeted, or in which countries.
Saudi security forces have rounded up dozens of members of the political and business elite, holding them in Riyadh’s opulent Ritz Carlton hotel on the orders of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The move was billed as a war on rampant corruption but also widely seen by analysts as helping Prince Mohammed consolidate his grip on power after ousting his cousin as heir to the throne in the summer.
Saudi officials are negotiating settlements with detainees, saying they aim to claw back some $100 billion of funds that rightfully belong to the state.
Muajab said last month that most detainees had agreed to settlements in order to avoid prosecution while the rest could be held for several more months.

He told Arrajol that those who end up in court will be permitted to hire lawyers to defend them during the investigation and trial phases.

The troops were killed when their joint patrol was attacked near the village of Tongo Tongo, on the Mali-Niger border, on Oct. 4 by dozens of militants armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.
The incident drew attention to the little-known U.S. military presence in Niger -- it has 800 troops stationed there -- and became a major publicity headache for President Donald Trump's administration.
Security officials had identified the perpetrators as Islamist militants loyal to Adnan Abu Waleed al-Sahrawi, the leader of Islamic State in the Greater Sahara operating along Mali's border with Niger and Burkina Faso, but there had previously been no confirmation from al-Sahrawi himself.
""We claim the attack which targeted the American commandos in the village of Tongo Tongo,"" Sahrawi, who makes public statements only very rarely, was quoted by ANI as saying.
Privately owned ANI sometimes enjoys privileged access to information on movements of Sahara-based Islamist fighters. Last year it broke news that Mali's main jihadist groups had merged, and in 2013 it had exclusive reports about a militant attack on a gas plant in Algeria in which 38 hostages were killed.
In the statement Sahrawi also claimed a car bomb attack on French troops on Thursday near Mali's city of Menaka, ANI reported. He said it had ""killed many of them"", although the French military said in a statement that the attack had merely wounded three troops.
Lawlessness across the Sahara has enabled jihadist groups to thrive and launch increasingly deadly attacks on local and Western targets there and in the semi-arid Sahel south of it. They are seen as the biggest threat to the region's stability.

(This version of the story corrects name Adnan Abu Waleed al-Sahrawi, paragraph 4)

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said it was closely monitoring the Mayon volcano in Albay province, which last erupted in 2014.
Mayon's most destructive eruption was in February 1841, when lava flows buried a town and killed 1,200 people.
The volcano, known for its near-perfect cone shape, is on the lowest alert level despite a ""phreatic or steam-driven eruption"", meaning people are not allowed to stay within a six-kilometer ""permanent danger zone"", Phivolcs said.
This also suggests there is no imminent major eruption, but the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council said it had ordered the evacuation of residents for the safety of their health due to expected ashfall.
It was not immediately clear how many residents had to leave the danger zone.
Those within the slope of the volcano, but outside the danger zone, were told to take precautionary measures against possible roof collapses due to accumulated ash and rainwater.

""The volcano's abnormal behaviour began late last year and it seems due for another one,"" Phivolcs chief Renato Solidum said.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia plans to increase support for poor families and needy people, a government source said on Saturday, after protests broke out in the North African country.
The source did not give more details but it was the first time an official talked about increasing aid since protests, some of them violent, broke out on Monday against austerity measures imposed by the government to cut a budget deficit.
President Beji Caid Essebsi was meeting on Saturday with the ruling coalition of Islamists and secular forces to discuss the protests, a source said, without giving details.
Activists and the opposition have called for fresh protests on Sunday, the seventh anniversary of the toppling of autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, the first leader to fall in the 2011 ""Arab Spring"" protests that swept the region.
On Saturday, several hundred protesters took to the streets in Sidi Bouzid, a central town where the 2011 uprising erupted after a young man set himself on fire following the confiscation of his fruit cart by policemen demanding bribes.
The fresh protests draw on anger over price and tax increases included in this year's budget that took effect on Jan. 1.
The government has blamed the opposition and ""troublemakers"" for stoking unrest, a charge the opposition has denied. 
Almost 800 people have been arrested for vandalism and violence such as throwing petrol bombs at police stations, the interior ministry said on Friday.
Prices have increased for fuel and some consumer goods, while taxes on cars, phone calls, the internet, hotel accommodation and other items have also gone up.
Tunisia has been hailed as the only democratic success of the Arab Spring: the one Arab country to topple a long-serving leader in that year's uprisings without triggering widespread violence or civil war. Tunisian politicians were awarded the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize for achieving non-violent change.

But Tunisia has had nine governments since Ben Ali's overthrow, none of which have been able to resolve deep-rooted economic problems. The economy worsened since a vital tourism sector was nearly wiped out by a wave of deadly militant attacks in 2015, and has yet to recover despite improved security.

The four members of the salvage team wore respirators to board the ""Sanchi"", where they found the two bodies on the deck.
They tried to get to the living quarters but were driven back by temperatures on the burning ship of around 89 Celsius (192 Fahrenheit), Xinhua said.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif by telephone that ""as long as there is 1 percent of hope, China will continue to make 100 percent effort"" in the rescue effort, according to a report on the ministry website.
The body of a mariner suspected to be from the ship was recovered on Monday and sent to Shanghai for identification. The rest of the crew, which included 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis, remains missing.

The salvage team recovered the voyage data recorder, or ""black box"" from the bridge, before leaving the vessel less than half an hour after boarding because the wind had shifted and ""thick toxic smoke"" had complicated the operation, Xinhua said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States, South Korea and Japan must coordinate more closely on North Korea, with whom they are engaged in a ""pre-negotiation bargaining process"", a former Japanese defense official told Reuters.
North Korea's Kim Jong Un has shown no sign of willingness to give in to U.S. demands and negotiate away a nuclear and missile program, in defiance of United Nations Security Council sanctions. 
But despite the tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, the two Koreas held their first talks in two years on Tuesday and agreed to meet again.
The United States and its regional allies have taken a ""coercive military option"" by using B-1B bombers, stealth fighters, and aircraft carriers, Narushige Michishita, professor at Japan's National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies said in an interview at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP).
""We are kind of testing North Korea's ability to respond ... We are collecting information as to the intentions and capabilities of North Korea armed forces,"" he told Reuters.
""By conducting different military actions, one of the objectives that the U.S. might have is to drive a wedge between political leaders and military leaders inside North Korea,"" he added. 
North Korea has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland and has fired two missiles over Japan, putting Tokyo in range.
However, Michishita said he did not expect U.S. President Donald Trump to undertake a preventive strike.
""In order to destroy an important part of North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes, you have to really undertake a major war against North Korea almost. Conventional, but a major war,"" Michishita said.

Any attack would need to destroy North Korea's nuclear and missile programs as well as conventional weapons such as long-range artillery and rocket launchers aimed at Seoul, he said.

The delegation led by the unification minister Cho Myung-kyun, will be sent to hold talks on the prospects of North Korea sending its performance art group to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, the ministry said in a statement.
Inter-Korean talks are held alternately at the Peace House, which is on the South Korean side of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone, and Tongil Pavilion in the North.
The ministry said earlier on Saturday that North Korea had proposed holding talks on Jan. 15 about the matter.
""In addition, the ministry also requested for a quick response for South Korea's proposal on Jan. 12 to have working-level talks about the North's participation in Pyongchang winter Olympics,"" added the ministry.
Officials from North and South earlier this week said they had agreed to hold negotiations to resolve problems and avert accidental conflict, after their first official dialogue in more than two years amid high tension over the North's weapons program.
South Korea had also said that it is seeking to form a combined women's hockey team with the North. The North Korea's International Olympics Committee (IOC) official said the committee is considering the proposal, while the two sides will also have talks hosted by IOC on Jan. 20.
In a joint statement after 11 hours of talks on Tuesday, North and South Korea said they had agreed to hold military to military talks and that North Korea would send a large delegation to next month's Winter Olympics.

The Kurdish YPG militia said Turkish forces inside Syria fired shells into Afrin on Saturday, but no one was wounded. 
Turkish troops entered Idlib three months ago after an agreement with Russia and Iran for the three countries to try to reduce fighting between pro-Syrian government forces and rebel fighters in the largest remaining insurgent-held part of Syria.
But the few observation posts which the Turkish army says it has established are close to the dividing line between Arab rebel-held land and the Kurdish-controlled region of Afrin.
""If the terrorists in Afrin don't surrender we will tear them down,"" Erdogan told a congress of his ruling AK Party in the eastern Turkish city of Elazig.
The Kurdish YPG militia said Turkish forces stationed in Syria shelled several Kurdish villages in the Afrin region on Saturday, without causing casualties. 
Rojhat Roj, the YPG spokesman in Afrin, told Reuters the shelling was carried out by Turkish forces in Dar Taizaah and Qalat Seman - areas where he said Turkish forces had deployed as part of the agreement with Russia and Iran.
""From our side, there is no shelling at present,"" he added.
Erdogan has said the Kurdish YPG militia is trying to establish a ""terror corridor"" on Turkey's southern border, linking Afrin with a large Kurdish-controlled area to the east. 
In 2016 Turkey launched its Euphrates Shield military offensive in northern Syria to push back Islamic State from the border and drive a wedge between the Kurdish controlled regions.
""With the Euphrates Shield operation we cut the terror corridor right in the middle. We hit them one night suddenly. With the İdlib operation, we are collapsing the western wing,"" Erdogan said, referring to Afrin.
He also said Turkey could drive YPG forces out of Manbij. The mainly Arab town lies west of the Euphrates, and Turkey has long demanded that Kurdish fighters pull back east of the river.
""In Manbij, if they break the promises, we will take the matter in our own hands until there are no terrorists left. They will see what we’ll do in about a week,"" Erdogan said.
Turkey was a major supporter of rebels fighting to overthrow Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, but is alarmed by the strength of Kurdish forces - which Ankara says are linked to Kurdish militants fighting in southeast Turkey.
It has criticized the United States for arming YPG and Arab fighters in the Syrian Democratic Forces, which drove Islamic State out of Raqqa and other parts of Syria.

""The U.S. sent 4,900 trucks of weapons in Syria. We know this. This is not what allies do,"" Erdogan said. ""We know they sent 2,000 planes full of weapons.""

MONTECITO, Calif (Reuters) - Californian authorities called for public help in locating seven people still missing after mudslides that killed at least 18, as crews carried on searching for survivors on Saturday.
The Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office made a plea for information on any of the missing residents, while acknowledging that finding anyone alive would be a ""miracle"". 
""The missing persons were reported by family and friends, and resided in areas that were heavily damaged during the storm and subsequent mudslides,"" the sheriff's office said.
The sheriff's office listed the names of the missing, who range in age from two to 62, in a statement on Friday night.
The disaster struck on Tuesday after heavy rains soaked the area near Montecito, north of Los Angeles, where vegetation had been denduded by the largest wildfire in California's history.
Sodden hillsides gave way, unleashing a torrent of mud, water, uprooted trees and boulders onto the valley below and causing what the police described as ""traumatic injuries"" to the victims, who ranged in age from 3 to 89.
The destruction covered 30 square miles and more than 2,100 personnel from local, state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy and the American Red Cross are involved in ""challenging"" search, recovery and relief efforts, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.
Officials ordered residents in most of the southeastern corner of Montecito, which is east of Santa Barbara, to leave their homes for what was likely to be one or two weeks.
One of California's most celebrated roads, coastal Highway 101, was partially closed, with mud was two feet deep in places, while in Montecito, mud reached the roof lines of houses, as residents surveyed their damaged homes.
""We have a yard to redo and hopefully our insurance will help out with that, but the people across from me, newer homes, gone,"" Garrett Speirs, a 54-year-old artist who has been living in Montecito for 20 years, said.

Egyptian officials had no immediate comment on the incident which happened late on Friday after dark near the southern border-town Rafah, according to Gaza Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra.
It could not be confirmed whether the fisherman was attempting to cross into Egyptian waters. Egyptian naval forces have previously opened fire on Gazans they accused of crossing the maritime border.
Fishermen from Gaza have often brought in catch from Egyptian territory to sidestep restrictions imposed by Israel’s naval blockade of the enclave, which Israel maintains citing security concerns. 
Gaza fishermen say that the limited fishing zone imposed by Israel is not big enough to meet demand of the coastal strip's 2 million people. 
Gaza is run by Islamist group Hamas, which has fought three wars with Israel and is designated a terrorist group by Western countries and Israel.
Israel withdrew troops and settlers from the territory in 2005 but remains the conduit for the passage of goods and supplies most of its electricity. Israel and Egypt, citing security concerns, maintain tight restrictions on the passage of Palestinians through their borders with the enclave.

Russian annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, triggering economic sanctions by the European Union and United States and a tense stand-off in the region.
The U.S. said in December it planned to provide Ukraine with ""enhanced defensive capabilities"", which officials said included Javelin anti-tank missiles.. 
Moscow's latest deployment represents the second division armed with S-400 air defense systems on the peninsula, after the first in the spring of 2017 near the port town of Fedosia.
The new division will be based next to the town of Sevastopol and will control the airspace over the border with Ukraine, the RIA news agency reported.
The new air defense system, designed to defend Russia's borders, can be turned into combat mode in less than five minutes, Interfax news agency quoted Viktor Sevostyanov, a commander with Russia's air forces, as saying.
Russia's defense ministry says the S-400 systems, known as ""Triumph"", can bring down airborne targets at a range of 400 kilometers and ballistic missiles at a range of 60 kilometers.
They were first introduced to the Russian military's arsenal in 2007, the ministry said.

Thai barracks and government offices traditionally open their doors to children on the second Saturday of January, allowing kids to handle weapons. Children visiting Government House also got a chance to sit in the prime minister’s chair.    
The 18 figures of the prime minister were set up around Government House. They show him in a variety of poses - including kicking a football and a boxing pose.
Prayuth drew fire from rights groups this week when he jokingly set up one of the cardboard figures up in front of a microphone and told reporters that if they had questions they should ""ask this guy"". Then he walked off.
Wansu Chai-aree, 14, is one of the many Thai teenagers who on Saturday posed for pictures with cutouts of the Prime Minister, who he refers to affectionately by his nickname ""Tu"".
""I would like uncle Tu to stay on to develop our country for as long as possible,"" Wansu told Reuters.
Prayuth, who seized power during turmoil in 2014, has been coy about his political future but has appeared keen to improve his public image amid growing suspicions that he plans to stay in power after the next election.
His government has promised to hold a general election in November 2018 after repeatedly delaying the vote.
The Thai military has long played a big role in the country's political and social life and uses Children’s Day to reinforce its message with a new generation.
""These days we are stepping closer to our people than before,"" Thai Army Chief General Chalermchai Sitthisart said during a Children's Day speech at an army camp in Bangkok.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Singapore court on Saturday charged three men suspected of involvement in large-scale oil theft at Shell's biggest refinery, days after bringing charges against 11 under an extensive probe by authorities in the city state.
The Singapore subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc first contacted the authorities in August 2017 about theft at its Pulau Bukom industrial site, just south of the country's main island. 
Police have seized millions of dollars in cash and a small tanker in the sting operation involving simultaneous raids across Singapore, one of the world's most important oil trading centers and a major refinery hub. 
Earlier this week, a Singapore court charged 11 men including eight Shell employees and two Vietnamese nationals related to the theft following a weekend raid arresting 17 people.
But the charges leveled against three additional suspects on Saturday have entangled Sentek Marine & Trading Pte, one of Singapore's biggest marine fuel suppliers, and the investigation found that one of two vessels used to transport the stolen oil products was managed by the firm.
Sentak Marine said in a statement two of the three suspects had been employees, one a marketing and operations manager and the other a cargo officer. It said both had been dismissed. 
The role of the third, a Vietnamese national, was not immediately disclosed by the court or the companies. A Shell spokeswoman said none of the men charged on Saturday was an employee of the company.
The three are accused of receiving stolen property, with a combined value of S$896,444 ($676,510.45), at Pulau Bukom site, where Shell has its largest refinery, according to court documents. 
The amount of oil products involved in the theft on two days in late 2017 were in addition to more than 4,300 tonnes of gasoil valued at S$2.4 million specified in charges brought against other 11 suspects on Tuesday.
Court documents listed two vessels used in the transfer of stolen oil products on Nov. 11 and Dec. 31 at two wharfs at Pulau Bukom.
Sentek 26, which carries a Singapore flag, and MT Gaea have been traveling around the city state over the last 30 days, both making one journey down to the Indonesian island of Batam in late December, Thomson Reuters data shows.
The manager of the ship Sentek 26, Sentek Marine & Trading, was the biggest bunker fuel supplier in Singapore by volume last year, according to official data. Singapore is the world's biggest marine refueling stop.

Illicit oil trading is widespread in Southeast Asia where stolen fuel is sold across the region, often offloaded directly into trucks or tanks at small harbors away from oil terminals.

YANGON (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslim insurgents said on Saturday that ten Rohingya found in a mass grave in Myanmar's troubled Rakhine state last month were ""innocent civilians"", and not members of their group.
Myanmar's military said earlier this week its soldiers had killed 10 captured Muslim ""terrorists"" during insurgent attacks at the beginning of September, after Buddhist villagers had forced the captured men into a grave the villagers had dug.
It was a rare acknowledgment of wrongdoing by the Myanmar military during its operations in the western state of Rakhine.
The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), whose raids against security posts starting last August sparked sweeping military operations in the Muslim-majority northern part of Rakhine, said it ""whole-heartedly welcomes the admission"" of ""war crimes"" by the ""Burmese terrorist army"". 
""We hereby declare that these ten innocent Rohingya civilians found in the said mass grave in Inn Din Village Tract were neither ARSA nor had any association with ARSA"", the group said in a statement on Twitter. 
A Myanmar government spokesman said in response to ARSA's statement that sometimes ""terrorists and villagers were allied"" in attacks"" against security forces.
""We have already said it is very difficult to segregate who is a terrorist and who are innocent villagers,"" spokesman Zaw Htay said. ""There will be an ongoing investigating process whether they are members of ARSA or not."" 
The Myanmar military did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
'NEW STEP'
Myanmar’s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi said on Friday it was “positive” that the country’s military was taking responsibility for the actions of troops.
“It is a new step for our country,” she told a joint news conference with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono in Myanmar's capital of Naypyitaw. 
“I see it that way because a country needs to take responsibility for the rule of law in the country, and this is the first step on the road of taking responsibility and it is a positive thing,” She said, according to a transcript of the news conference posted on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
On Dec. 18, the military announced a mass grave containing 10 bodies had been found at the coastal village of Inn Din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of the state capital Sittwe. The army appointed a senior officer to investigate.
A statement from the military on Wednesday said its investigation had found that members of the security forces had taken part in the killing and action would be taken against them.
The Rohingya crisis erupted after Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts on Aug. 25 in Rakhine triggered a fierce military response that the United Nations denounced as ethnic cleansing.

Myanmar denies ethnic cleansing, saying its security forces had mounted legitimate counter-insurgency clearance operations.

Bump stocks believed to be used in the massacre were found in the 32nd-floor hotel room from where Stephen Paddock fired down on a crowd gathered on a Sunday night for the finale of a country music festival held on the Las Vegas Strip.
The details suggesting the attack may have planned months in advance were part of more than 300 pages of search warrants unsealed by a federal judge in Nevada on Friday, according to the Los Angeles Times, one of several publications that sought release of the documents.
Reuters was unable to obtain a copy of the documents on Friday night.
The unsealed documents do not provide a motive for the killings, the Los Angeles Times reported.
Paddock shot and killed himself before police arrived at his hotel room the night of the shootings.
The documents also showed that Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, told investigators before they searched a house that the two shared that they might find her fingerprints on ammunition ""because she occasionally participated in loading magazines,"" the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. 
In the days after the shootings, authorities called Danley a ""person of interest."" Her attorney has said she had no inkling of Paddock's plans.
Documents posted online by the Review-Journal showed that FBI agents sought information from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) regarding the accounts held by Paddock and Danley.
Microsoft and Facebook did not immediately respond to emails and calls from Reuters on Friday night.
An unsealed search warrant shows that an email sent July 6, 2017 from an account linked to Paddock to an address that he may also have controlled discusses the use of bump stocks ""for a thrill,"" according to an affidavit posted by the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
The emails also mentioned trying out an AR-style rifle before purchasing one.

The Los Angeles Times reported that investigators are not sure why Paddock would send emails between accounts he controlled, or whether one was controlled by another person, which would mean, ""investigators need to determine who was communicating with him about weapons that were used in the attack,"" one of the warrants said.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Costa Rica's civil aviation agency suspended local airline Nature Air on Friday, two weeks after one of its small planes crashed near a tourist beach, killing two Costa Rican pilots and 10 U.S. citizens. 
Ennio Cubillo, director of the civil aviation agency, informed Nature Air in a letter that it ""preventatively"" suspended all operations because several key employees were no longer with the company. 
""It doesn't directly have to do with the accident,"" said a civil aviation source who declined to be named because the investigation is still proceeding. 
Nature Air's pilot training director died in the crash on New Year's Eve near the Punta Islita beach town about 140 miles (230 km) west of the capital, San Jose. The co-pilot was also killed, along with a family of five from New York. 
Nature Air's operations manager quit this week and its aerial security director has requested a leave of absence. 
""Nature Air doesn't have, at the moment, a reliable and effective management structure to guarantee the execution of safe air operations,"" said the letter from Cubillo, who has said the investigation could take months.
Investigators are analyzing weather conditions at the time of the crash, possible mechanical failures and human error to determine what caused the Cessna 208B Grand Caravan to plummet from the sky shortly after takeoff. 

Earlier this week, Costa Rican authorities raided Nature Air's offices in what they described as a routine operation to collect information.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>",Former Argentine vice president freed pending corruption trial,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's former economy minister and vice president, Amado Boudou, was freed from jail on Friday after an appeals court ruled that he was unlikely to interfere in a corruption case against him.
Boudou, who served under former President Cristina Fernandez, was arrested in early November on racketeering and money laundering charges. His lawyer said at the time that assertions Boudou might try to meddle in the case were preposterous.
The ex-minister, who denies any wrongdoing, told reporters on Friday night that the justice system had ""committed an abuse"" by jailing him.
Boudou was the second senior official from Fernandez's government to have been detained. 
Her former planning minister, Julio De Vido, was jailed on corruption charges in October. Last month a federal judge dealt the hardest blow yet to Fernandez, calling on Congress to remove her immunity as a senator so she could be arrested.
Fernandez, whose policies vastly increased the role of the government in Latin America's third-biggest economy, was succeeded in late 2015 by her business-friendly political opposite Mauricio Macri, who has vowed to reform Argentina's sluggish judiciary.
The former president and her loyalists accuse Macri of orchestrating a political vendetta against her.

Boudou faces three counts of ""illicit enrichment"" dating back to 2009, the year he was promoted from heading Argentina's social security administration to become economy minister. Boudou became vice president in 2011 when Fernandez won reelection. But he was largely absent from public view during that term as accusations of corruption mounted against him.

MONTECITO, Calif. (Reuters) - Rescue crews expanded their search on Friday for at least five people missing after mudslides in southern California that killed at least 17 people, damaged hundreds of buildings and caked highways with sludge.
About 1,250 emergency workers raced against the clock to find survivors with drones, heavy equipment and sniffer dogs in the rescue and clean-up efforts, the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services said.
“We’ve got a window that’s closing but we’re still very optimistic we’ve got some time. There’s been plenty of cases where they’ve found people a week after,"" Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason said on a muddy Montecito street that was especially hard hit by the mudslide.
In Santa Barbara County, it has been at least two days since anyone was rescued alive, Eliason said. Most rescues were on Tuesday.
The number of missing has fluctuated as people were located, said the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office. Authorities said on Thursday night that 43 people were not accounted for.
Residents in some areas were subject to a new mandatory evacuation on Friday, emergency officials said, adding that the unstable environment remained a threat to residents and emergency responders.
Triggered by heavy rains, the massive slides struck before dawn on Tuesday. Walls of mud and debris cascaded down hillsides stripped of trees and shrubs last month by wildfires, including the Thomas Fire, the largest blaze in the state's history.
EXHAUSTED CREWS
Excavators carrying rescuers in their buckets plowed through mud-coated roads in search of the missing after some areas were buried in as much as 15 feet (4.6 m) of mud, emergency officials said.
""It is heavy. It's wet. It just exhausts the crews out there,"" Sacramento Fire Department Captain Pat Costamagna said in a social media video from the governor's emergency management office.
County officials have already ordered residents in most of the southeastern corner of Montecito, an unincorporated community east of the city of Santa Barbara, to leave their homes for what they said was likely to be one or two weeks to aid the search and recovery efforts.
In one of the worst-hit areas of Montecito, mud blew through doors and windows, filling the interiors of houses with muck and debris. The walls at one end of a home had disappeared, leaving its roof hanging precariously.
Downed power lines wrapped around trees at one property, while elsewhere the lines dropped almost to the ground. Elsewhere, cars were perched on mounds of earth and garage doors had caved in.
The area, northwest of Los Angeles, is home to many celebrities and other wealthy Californians who relish the seclusion and relative proximity to the city.
The cause of death for all 17 victims will be listed as multiple traumatic injuries resulting from flash floods with mudslides, the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s office said Thursday. The dead ranged in age from 3 to 89.
Eight Cal Fire workers in yellow jackets picked through debris with shovels and axes on a tree-lined residential street in Montecito, searching for vehicles swept away in the mudslides.
“They’re all pretty trashed in the mud,” said Cal Fire Captain Mitch Colombo, facing a pair of vehicles resting at odd angles on a floe of muck in front of a residential gate.
One of California's most celebrated roads, coastal Highway 101, was closed in parts of Santa Barbara County where mud was 2 feet deep in parts.
Residents of the mudslide-hit area were assessing their damaged homes, with some grateful their properties had survived.
""We have a yard to redo and hopefully our insurance will help out with that, but the people across from me, newer homes, gone,"" said Garrett Speirs, a 54-year-old artist who has been living in Montecito for 20 years.

""Everybody down below gone, two girls gone,"" Speirs said. ""Two sixth graders in the school our kids went to.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump gave the Iran nuclear deal a final reprieve on Friday but warned European allies and Congress they had to work with him to fix ""the disastrous flaws” in the pact or face a U.S. exit.
Trump said he would waive sanctions against Iran that were lifted as part of the international deal for the last time unless his conditions were met. 
The ultimatum puts pressure on Europeans - key backers and parties to the 2015 international agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program – to satisfy Trump, who wants the pact strengthened with a separate agreement within 120 days.
""Despite my strong inclination, I have not yet withdrawn the United States from the Iran nuclear deal,"" Trump said in a statement. ""Instead, I have outlined two possible paths forward: either fix the deal’s disastrous flaws, or the United States will withdraw.""
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded on Twitter that the deal was not renegotiable and that Trump's stance ""amounts to desperate attempts to undermine a solid multilateral agreement.""
Trump, who has sharply criticized the deal reached during Democrat Barack Obama's presidency, had privately chafed at having to once again waive sanctions on a country he sees as a rising threat in the Middle East. 
""This is a last chance,"" Trump said, pushing for a separate agreement. ""In the absence of such an agreement, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. And if at any time I judge that such an agreement is not within reach, I will withdraw from the deal immediately.""
The EU said in a statement it had taken note of Trump’s decision and would assess its implications.
Underscoring the difficulty now facing Europeans, a European diplomat, speaking under condition of anonymity, said: ""It's going to be complicated to save the deal after this.""
While Trump approved the sanctions waiver, the Treasury Department announced new, targeted sanctions against 14 entities and people, including the head of Iran's judiciary, Sadeq Amoli Larijani, a close ally of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Trump now will work with European partners on a follow-on agreement that enshrines certain triggers that the Iranian regime cannot exceed related to ballistic missiles, said senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the decision.
One senior administration official said Trump would be open to remaining in a modified deal if it were made permanent.
""I hereby call on key European countries to join with the United States in fixing significant flaws in the deal, countering Iranian aggression, and supporting the Iranian people,"" Trump said in the statement. 
Republican Senator Bob Corker said ""significant progress"" had been made on bipartisan congressional legislation to ""address the flaws in the agreement without violating U.S. commitments.""
SEVERAL CONDITIONS
Trump laid out several conditions to keep the United States in the deal. Iran must allow ""immediate inspections at all sites requested by international inspectors,"" he said, and ""sunset"" provisions imposing limits on Iran's nuclear program must not expire. Trump said U.S. law must tie long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs together, making any missile testing by Iran subject to ""severe sanctions.""
The president wants Congress to modify a law that reviews U.S. participation in the nuclear deal to include ""trigger points"" that, if violated, would lead to the United States reimposing its sanctions, the official said.
This would not entail negotiations with Iran, the official said, but rather would be the result of talks between the United States and its European allies. Work already has begun on this front, the official said.
Analyst Richard Nephew said whether Trump’s conditions could be met depended on whether he wants a face-saving way to live with the nuclear deal with the political cover of tough-sounding U.S. legislation, or whether he really wants the deal rewritten.
Nephew, a former White House and State Department Iran sanctions expert, said legislation could be drafted that might appear to assuage Trump’s concerns, but that getting Iran to agree to allow unfettered international inspections or to no time limits on the nuclear deal's restrictions was impossible.
Trump has argued behind the scenes that the nuclear deal makes the United States look weak, a senior U.S. official said. 
A decision to withhold a waiver would have effectively ended the deal between Iran, the United States, China, France, Russia, Britain, Germany and the European Union. The other parties to the agreement would have been unlikely to join the United States in reimposing sanctions.
Hailed by Obama as key to stopping Iran from building a nuclear bomb, the deal lifted economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program but Trump has argued that Obama negotiated a bad deal.
PRESSURE FROM EUROPE
Britain, France and Germany called on Trump on Thursday to uphold the pact. 
Iran says its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes and that it will stick to the accord as long as the other signatories respect it, but will “shred” the deal if Washington pulls out.
Two EU diplomats said EU foreign ministers will discuss what to do now at their next regular meeting, scheduled for Jan. 22 in Brussels.
The U.S. Congress requires the president to decide periodically whether to certify Iran’s compliance with the deal and issue a waiver to allow U.S sanctions to remain suspended.
Trump in October chose not to certify compliance and warned he might ultimately terminate the accord. He accused Iran of “not living up to the spirit” of the agreement even though the International Atomic Energy Agency says Tehran is complying.
Hard-liners on Iran in the U.S. Congress have called for the reimposition of the suspended sanctions and an end to the nuclear deal, while some liberal Democrats want to pass legislation that would make it harder for Trump to pull Washington out without congressional consent.

Trump and his top advisers have been negotiating with U.S. lawmakers on Capitol Hill to try to change sanctions legislation so that Trump does not face a deadline on whether to recertify Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal every 90 days.

1556,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 07:09PM ET</span>",Czechs pick between east-looking Zeman and pro-western challengers in presidential vote,"By Jan Lopatka
PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czechs wrap up voting on Saturday in the first round of a presidential election in which eight candidates are seeking to oust the incumbent Milos Zeman, whose inclination toward far-right groups and warm relations with Russia and China have split public opinion.
The vote, likely to end in a run-off in two weeks' time, is seen as a referendum on the 73-year-old Zeman, in office since 2013, who has harshly criticized migration from Muslim countries and is keen to boost ties with Moscow and Beijing. 
Czech presidents have limited executive powers but previous incumbents have had a strong influence on public opinion. They are also pivotal in forming governments -- which the European Union and NATO member country is now trying to do.
Opinion polls show Zeman is the favorite but may face a strong challenge in the second round, expected in two weeks, where the two strongest candidates go head to head. Pro-western academic Jiri Drahos, 68, was the leading challenger in the final opinion polls.
A win by any of Zeman's main rivals could mean that voices from the Czech leadership may shift closer to the EU mainstream, in contrast to ex-communist neighbors such as Poland and Hungary, whose governments have clashed with Brussels. 
A former centre-left prime minister, Zeman has adopted a strongly anti-immigration stance, echoing the majority feeling in the country, and has won endorsements from the Communist Party as well as the main far-right SPD group.
He has sought more trade and tighter political relations with China - he was also the only western leader to attend a military parade in Beijing in 2015.
Zeman has warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has called for the removal of EU sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea to boost business, promoting which is one of his stated aims.
""If Zeman stays, it will bode well for the companies that he promotes, which have business interests in China and Russia,"" said Pavel Saradin, a political scientist at Palacky University.
Zeman has strong support mainly in the countryside of the nation of 10.6 million people, and he often snipes at Prague ""elites"" and the media. 
""Polarisation of society has deepened in the past months,"" Saradin said. ""Data also show a deepening rift between cities and the countryside.""
Zeman's stance against migration has been a vote winner in the country, which has clashed with the European Commission over its refusal to accept migrants under quotas set by a vote by EU leaders.
First-round voting ends at 2:00 p.m. (1300 GMT) on Saturday, and results are expected later in the afternoon.
The outcome may influence Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis's chances of forming a cabinet, although his first attempt to rule in a minority administration is likely to be rejected by parliament next week.
Zeman has backed Babis even though the billionaire businessman has struggled to get support from other political parties while he battles police allegations that he illegally obtained EU subsidies a decade ago. Babis denies wrongdoing.

Babis said on Thursday that he would vote for Zeman.

SANTO DOMINGO (Reuters) - Members of Venezuela's leftist government and opposition leaders resumed talks in the Dominican Republic on Friday, seeking to reach an agreement to ease a deep political and economic crisis in the OPEC country.
The two sides failed to come to terms in a prior round of talks last December, when they concluded by saying they had made progress but needed more time. Expectations among Venezuelans for a deal this time around are low.
Opposition coalition Democratic Unity ""is attending the meeting in good faith, to seek a way of allowing Venezuelans to build a route to the future,"" tweeted party lawmaker Luis Florido on Thursday.
The opposition leaders are demanding that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro accept humanitarian assistance from abroad to ease a crisis that has led to shortages of food and basic goods for millions of people.
They are also calling for the release of several hundred jailed political activists. 
Government representatives want the opposition to push for the elimination of sanctions levied last year by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which have added to economic woes and complicated a debt restructure.
Dominican President Danilo Medina is leading the negotiations, which also include representatives from Bolivia, Chile, Mexico and Nicaragua.
Some of the participating countries have threatened to withdraw if agreements are not reached in this round.
""If there are no concrete and credible results, then there will be no point in moving forward,"" Chilean Foreign Minister Heraldo Munoz wrote on his Twitter account on Thursday.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe was sacked as president illegally and the international community must help remove the ""military government"" that has taken power or risk the country descending into chaos, an exiled Mugabe loyalist said on Friday.
Mugabe, 93, stood down last November, a week after the army and his former political allies turned against him, ending nearly four decades of rule marred by allegations of corruption, human rights abuses and economic negligence.
His former vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, 75, whose sacking prompted the military takeover that forced Mugabe out, was sworn in as president and the general who led the de facto coup, Constantino Chiwenga, was installed as his deputy.
Mugabe's resignation came in the form of a written statement and he has not spoken since.
""The president was alleged to have resigned. There is no evidence,"" Jonathan Moyo, a cabinet minister under Mugabe, told Reuters by phone from an undisclosed location, in one of the first detailed accounts from a Mugabe supporter since the coup.
""It is completely unsustainable for anyone to say Mugabe resigned voluntarily when we know the army took over all institutions of the state and confined him to his residence. You have to be applying a Banana Republic model to say he resigned.""
Moyo was the fiercely combative mouthpiece for a faction in the ruling ZANU-PF party that opposed Mnangagwa and backed Mugabe's 52-year old wife, Grace, to succeed him.
Mugabe's departure brought tens of thousands of jubilant Zimbabweans onto the streets and was widely cheered by leaders in Africa and the West.
But Moyo said the international community, including the African Union and the United Nations, was making a huge mistake if it legitimized a government that came to power via a coup.
""This is a military government. You cannot send the arsonists to be the fire brigade,"" he said.
He said the public was currently living in unprecedented fear of the former soldiers who have taken political office but eventually the masses would not stand for an ""illegal regime"".
""FLOODGATES TO CONFLICT""
""If you don't intervene when there has been such an outrageous, brazen attack on a constitutional order, you are simply opening the floodgates to conflict,"" he said.
""If they don't act, just as the sun will rise tomorrow, Zimbabwe will be another Somalia. There will be bloodshed.""
Government officials could not immediately be reached for comment. But in response to earlier criticisms leveled by Moyo, government spokesman George Charamba said on Thursday the issue of legitimacy or illegitimacy did not arise.
He pointed to large demonstrations in November calling for Mugabe's departure and ""across the political spectrum support"" for his replacement by a new administration.
""So really this is a bitter, bitter defeated politician,"" Charamba said.
Many of Mugabe's political allies were either arrested by the military in a series of spectacular raids in the early hours of Nov. 15 or they fled into neighboring countries.
Moyo said he narrowly escaped with his life.
""This was not Mickey Mouse stuff. There was heavy gunfire for 15 minutes. They shot stun grenades in the house. I was there with my wife and children,"" Moyo said, adding that he has since fled to another country over fears for his safety.
""They still have aspirations to harm me."" 
Grace Mugabe's accelerating presidential ambitions contributed to Mnangagwa and the military taking action to prevent her taking over from her ailing husband.
Moyo, a figure reviled in much of Zimbabwe for his often brutal verbal assaults on detractors, says he has no regrets.
""I will never, ever accept the proposition that those who use violence have outsmarted me,"" he said.

""I would rather be hated for standing for my principles and believing in the rule of law than be feared that if people don't agree with me I will unleash the tanks.""

Bloomberg reported earlier on Friday that the Spanish and Dutch finance ministers had agreed to work together for a softer Brexit agreement that maintains close ties between the EU and Britain.
The Spanish finance minister met his new Dutch counterpart but no deal was reached, spokesman Coen Gelinck said.
""There is nothing new here. They are well-known positions that were exchanged... We were there for a get-to-know-you meeting and we discussed the fact we both have strong ties with the U.K. and that it is in our interests that this is known,"" Gelinck said.
Spain's economy ministry also denied the report.
Spain and the Netherlands both support the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, Gelinck said.
Britain is due to exit the EU on March 29, 2019, but is preparing to discuss the terms of a two-year transition period beyond that date with Barnier, who represents the interests of the other 27 EU member states in the Brexit negotiations.
Britain and the EU also aim to discuss their future trading relationship. Some in the UK government favor keeping close ties with the EU, the country's biggest trade partner, in what is known as a ""soft Brexit"", while others want a clean break. 

After the report, sterling traded up more than one percent on the day at $1.3692, its highest level since the Brexit referendum on June 24, 2016. The currency plunged after Britons voted by a small margin to leave the EU.

Author Frederic Beigbeder was enjoying a Wednesday evening Moscow Mule at the Ernest Hemingway bar when the robbers struck.
""I thought it was a terrorist attack,"" said the Frenchman, who hid in a toilet room for ten minutes as police arrived.
""I thought we were all going down, to be killed one by one. Shots rang, you could hear Frank Sinatra and Christmas tunes playing in the corridors,"" he told Le Figaro newspaper. 
Police say they have recovered the millions of dollars worth of jewels that were snatched from glass display cases and caught three robbers who got blocked inside the premises.
But two others are on the run after fleeing the scene on the Place Vendome square in central Paris. 
""It was pretty surreal, like being in a David Lynch movie,"" Beigbeder added, referring to the maker of art-house classics such as Eraserhead and Mulholland Drive.

The comments from the Turkish Foreign Ministry come after the U.S. Department of State this week warned U.S. citizens planning to visit Turkey to reconsider due to ""terrorism and arbitrary detentions"".
Ties between Washington and Ankara, the biggest Muslim country in NATO and a major U.S. ally in the Middle East, have been strained by a number of disputes in recent months, including the U.S. arrest and conviction of a Turkish banker in an Iran sanctions-busting case.
""Turkish citizens traveling to the United States may be subjected to arbitrary detentions based on testimony of unrespected sources,"" the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement dated Thursday.
The trial against the banker included testimony of corruption by senior Turkish officials. Ankara has said it was based on false evidence and supported by the network of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Turkish cleric Ankara blames for orchestrating a failed coup in Turkey in 2016.
Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has denied the charges and condemned the coup. Turkey has called for his extradition, but the United States says sufficient evidence has yet to be put to a court.
Turkey and the United States suspended issuing visas last year after Washington complained about the detention of two locally-hired consular employees on suspicion of a role in the failed coup. Both countries resumed issuing visas last month.
Turkey also blames Washington for supporting Kurdish fighters in Syria that Ankara sees as allies of a Kurdish group waging an insurgency in Turkey.
Speaking to reporters after Friday prayers, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim blamed the U.S. travel warning for harming relations.
""The 'Turkey is not a safe country' statement does not benefit ties between the two countries,"" Yildirim said.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, who is in Los Angeles and will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on the sidelines of a conference in Vancouver, said he would discuss the matter with his counterpart.

""An ally publishing a travel warning about us is not a serious thing, but we will discuss it with Tillerson in Vancouver,"" Cavusoglu said during a televised speech at the Turkish consulate in Los Angeles.

Macron in September offered an ambitious vision for European renewal, but has had to wait since for a response from EU powerhouse Germany, with much on hold there after parliamentary elections. 
The deal reached by Merkel and the SPD on Friday pledges close cooperation with France on strengthening the euro zone, in Berlin's first substantive response to Macron's proposals.
""We have had this morning ... good news from the other side of the Rhine,"" Macron told a news conference with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. ""We need more Europe and from what I saw of the provisional deal it acknowledges that."" 
The terms of the deal are more favorable to the European project than previous attempts for a German coalition government did at the end of last year, Macron said, adding that he was happy to find in the deal echoes of his own proposals.
However, while he welcomed the overall tone of the CDU-SPD deal, when asked about plans to turn the ESM bailout mechanism into a full-blown European Monetary Fund, which are included in the 28-page policy document agreed after all-night talks, Macron expressed some scepticism. 
""We need to finalise the banking union,"" Macron said, adding that the ESM might have to undergo some changes. ""But I don't think we need a new instrument to do so,"" he said.
""I know what the International Monetary Fund is but I struggle to see what a European Monetary Fund is, if not potentially bringing some confusion between several instruments .... whose objectives are different,"" he said, adding that that he was in favor of keeping the ESM as a rescue mechanism, with a separate fund to finance EU projects and a separate budgetary tool for the EU.

The German provisional deal also promises to devote ""specific budget funds"" to the economic stabilization of the single currency bloc and to support ""social convergence"" and structural reforms, saying this could form the basis of a future ""investment budget"".

""Field commanders confirmed to the SANA correspondent that terrorists from the Turkistan Islamic Party with the direct support, direction and planning of the Turkish regime, brought most of their forces... to start their attack,"" said SANA, the state news agency.
It added that the rebels had used Turkish vehicles. There was no immediate Turkish reaction to the allegations.
Turkey has been a major backer of Syrian rebels but has recently been working with Damascus's allies Iran and Russia in meetings with the stated aim of reducing violence.
Rebel groups launched a counter attack in Idlib on Wednesday after a rapid push by the army and its allies towards the Abu al-Duhur airbase. 
A military media unit run by the government's Lebanese ally Hezbollah, and a Britain-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said on Friday the army had recaptured several villages taken in the rebel counter attack. 
Turkey has criticized the army's assault in Idlib, located in northwest Syria in the rebels' biggest remaining stronghold, saying on Friday it would cause a new wave of migration. Idlib borders Turkey.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Vandals in Santiago attacked four churches before dawn on Friday, throwing homemade bombs that caused minor damage and leaving notes threatening Pope Francis just three days ahead of the pontiff's visit to Chile next week, police said.
The vandals, who are yet to be identified, set fire to at least two of the churches in the nation's capital city and tossed pamphlets in the street as they fled. 
One of the pamphlets read: ""Pope Francis, the next bomb will be in your robe,"" authorities said.
A fourth church was attacked with what appeared to be an explosive device, but no damage was sustained. No one was hurt in any of the attacks, authorities said.
Chilean police said they were investigating the incidents but had not yet identified suspects.
""In a democracy, people can express themselves as long as it's done in a pacifist way,"" Chile President Michelle Bachelet said in a radio interview on Friday morning. ""What happened last night is very strange. It's not something that we can tie to a particular group.""
The Vatican did not immediately react to the incident.
Several other churches have been attacked in recent years in south-central Chile. Most of those cases remain unresolved.
Francis, who hails from Argentina and is the first Latin American pope, will arrive in Chile on Monday. 
A Mass he has planned to hold on Tuesday in a Santiago park is expected to attract more than 500,000 people. 
Protests are expected on issues ranging from indigenous rights to an ongoing sexual abuse scandal in the Church.

Francis will also visit the south-central city of Temuco, and Iquique, which is farther north, before heading to Peru, where he will stop in Lima, Puerto Maldonado and Trujillo.

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 12:18PM ET</span>",Coalition deal leaves Merkel's fate in hands of Social Democrats,"By Paul Carrel
BERLIN (Reuters) - Angela Merkel has survived as German chancellor but the coalition deal she clinched on Friday puts her fate in the hands of her Social Democrat (SPD) partners and risks eroding support from her close allies before the end of her fourth term.
Europe's pre-eminent leader for more than 12 years, Merkel's star is waning as she pays for her 2015 decision to leave German borders open to over a million refugees, a move that cost her Christian Democrats votes and fueled the rise of the far-right.
After the collapse of talks in November to form a three-way coalition with the liberal Free Democrats and Greens, Merkel and her conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) allies were forced to turn again to the left-leaning SPD.
Merkel's immediate destiny now lies in the hands of rank-and-file Social Democrats whose party leaders will ask them on Jan. 21 to back Friday's deal, a repeat of the grand coalition that governed from 2013 to 2017. 
The chancellor, who still commands wide respect abroad, needed the talks to succeed to avoid further erosion of her authority, after losing ground in September elections, and the weakening of German influence, not least in the European Union.
An Infratest Dimap poll for broadcaster ARD published last week showed Merkel's personal approval had dropped 2 percentage points from a month earlier to 52 percent.
To win over the SPD, Merkel agreed to 5.95 billion euros ($7.2 billion) of investment in education, research and digitalization by 2021, expanded child care rights, and a pledge to strengthen Europe's cohesion with increased German contributions to the EU budget.
The investment is a small proportion of the extra 45 billion euros the government will have at its disposal for the next four years and for many in the SPD, the deal did not go far enough on cherished social justice issues.
The leader of the SPD's more radical Berlin branch, Michael Mueller, said commitments on affordable housing were inadequate.
""Living cannot be allowed to be a luxury,"" he said.
Friday's 28-page coalition blueprint also failed to convince Marcel Fratzscher, head of the DIW economic research institute and an advocate of stronger investment in Germany, who said ""a clear vision and courageous reforms are lacking"".
EUROPEAN LEGACY
Even if SPD delegates do back the coalition agreement, negotiations on forming a government could still fail.
Describing the deal clinched after a 25-hour meeting as a ""give and take"" agreement, Merkel said much hard work remained before a full coalition could be formed.
""The coalition negotiations probably won't be easier than the exploratory talks,"" she told a joint news conference with CSU leader Horst Seehofer and SPD leader Martin Schulz.
Mujtaba Rahman of political consultancy Eurasia assigned a 35 percent probability to coalition negotiations failing and leading to an early election or a minority government.
""There are still multiple risks to an overall agreement,"" he said. ""There is still a risk, even in a scenario where Merkel is able to form a government, that she will not be able to fulfil her complete term.""
Conservatives, though, were pleased Friday's coalition blueprint omitted a call from the SPD's Schulz for a ""United States of Europe"" by 2025.
""It is welcome that the goal of a United States of Europe, which sounds great and which perhaps sometime in the future can be a long-term objective, is not included in this coalition agreement,"" said Detlef Seif, the deputy EU spokesman for Merkel's conservative parliamentary bloc.
A commitment to ""sustainably strengthen and reform the euro zone"" in close partnership with France does give Merkel scope to secure her legacy as a guardian of the European project.
However, beyond boosting Germany's EU budget contribution and transforming the European Stability Mechanism that can bailout member states into a European Monetary Fund, the blueprint is short of specifics on Europe.
Fiscally conservative members of Merkel's Christian Democrats are wary of France pushing Berlin into European reforms at increased cost to the German taxpayer.
BEYOND MERKEL
Carsten Nickel, deputy research director at advisory firm Teneo Intelligence, said of Merkel's centrist strategy: ""The real challenge has always been to sell this logic internally.""
That Merkel has been able to survive as chancellor is partly due to the absence of a natural successor.
Though a challenger has yet to come forward, impatience is growing in Christian Democrat ranks about Merkel's tendency to manage crises as they arise rather than presenting a vision the party can rally behind and sell to voters.
Her message during campaigning for September's election was simply ""don't experiment"" with a shift to the political left - a narrative that failed to resonate with voters, who handed her conservatives their worst result since 1949. 
""The conversation has now moved on,"" said Eurasia's Rahman. ""There is a lot of active consideration being given to the post-Merkel era.""

He was lucky to survive the bomb that fell while he was having breakfast, dropped by one of the countless warplanes that emergency workers say have pounded the rebel-held Syrian enclave of Eastern Ghouta in recent days.
His three-year-old son was not so fortunate.
""We were sitting around, eating,"" said Abu Abdallah - a sobriquet meaning 'Abdallah's father' - as he recalled Tuesday's strike. ""My son wanted to use the toilet, so his mother took him. Then the missile came down."" 
""In less than a minute, the entire house fell on top of us.""
Relatives in the living room were also trapped in the debris. Everyone was screaming.
""I was under the rubble... and my head was bent down, I couldn't raise it,"" said Abu Abdallah, who declined to give his full name. ""I said that's it, this will be the end of me.""
Syrian troops and their allies have blockaded Eastern Ghouta, a densely populated pocket of satellite towns and farms, since 2013. It is the only remaining major rebel enclave near the Syrian capital. 
Rescue workers arrived within minutes and then pulled his wife out, he recalled. ""She told them there is a boy... and they got him out,"" he added. ""Everybody in the house got out safely except the boy. He was martyred.
""Honestly, I keep remembering the boy when they pulled him out... and the pressure with everything on top of me."" 
Abu Abdallah, 26, comes from the eastern Ghouta village of Marj al-Sultan, which the Syrian army recaptured from insurgents in late 2015. He had moved deeper into the enclave to the town of Saqba with his family to try to escape the bombing. 
""Now it's still not clear what we will do,"" he said. His family is staying with relatives while he recovers from a head injury and a back strain. 
Home to around 400,000 civilians, the Eastern Ghouta enclave faces a humanitarian catastrophe, the U.N. human rights chief said this week. 
Syrian government forces and their allies have killed at least 85 civilians there since the end of December, including 21 women and 30 children, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein also said.
""The (world) should have mercy on these children and women because they have nothing to do with the fighting,"" Abu Abdallah said. ""If they want to fight, let them go fight on the frontlines. But why are they bombing us?""

PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haiti on Friday expressed shock at reports that U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the Caribbean nation as a ""shithole,"" and summoned the top U.S. diplomat in the country for an explanation.
Trump on Thursday questioned why the United States would want to have immigrants from Haiti and African nations, referring to some as ""shithole countries,"" according to two sources familiar with the comments.
On Friday, the Republican president denied using those words. But Democratic U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, who attended a White House meeting on immigration the previous day, confirmed to reporters that Trump used ""vile, vulgar"" language, including ""shithole.""
African politicians labeled Trump a racist, while the United Nations human rights office rejected the reported comments as ""racist"" and inciting xenophobia.
Haiti's ambassador to Washington, Paul Altidor, said it was distressing that attention was drawn to the comments on Friday, the eighth anniversary of a devastating earthquake believed to have killed 220,000 people on the island, and should be a day of remembrance. 
""I spoke with President Jovenel Moise about the issue, and, of course, the President condemns such language and he is shocked.""
Altidor said Foreign Affairs Minister Antonio Rodrigue told him the U.S. chargé d’affaires in Haiti had been summoned to provide an explanation about the reported comments.
The ambassador said Haiti should be remembered for its contributions to history, including supporting the American Revolution by sending troops to the Battle of Savannah in Georgia in 1779.
""Haitians don't deserve such treatment,"" Altidor said. ""Haitians should not be seen as a bunch of immigrants who come to the United States to exploit U.S. resources. 
""We have been here for a long time and have contributed to what the United States is today. We even made the ultimate sacrifice when we shed our blood in Savannah.""

LIMA/VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis next week visits Peru, a country divided over former autocrat leader Alberto Fujimori, whose pardon from prison by the current president has reopened wounds from one of the country's darkest periods.
Peruvians will watch closely to see if the Argentine pope signals any concern over the pardon after he arrives on Thursday from Chile on the second leg of a South America trip, where corruption and the plight of indigenous people will likely come up.
President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker, last month narrowly survived an impeachment bid over a graft scandal with the help of Fujimori's loyalists in Congress, and pardoned Fujimori three days later.
    Fujimori, 79, had served less than half of a 25-year sentence for corruption and human rights crimes for commanding death squads to combat a Maoist-inspired insurgency during his 1990-2000 right-wing populist government.
    Opponents of both Fujimori and Kuczynski will be seeking a papal condemnation, even if only in general terms, of human rights abuses and corruption.
    ""Hopefully the Pope will show solidarity with the victims,"" said human rights activist Gisela Ortiz, whose brother was one of nine university students killed in a massacre of civilians that Fujimori was found guilty of ordering.
    She called on Francis to meet with her and other family members of Fujimori's victims. ""We want to express how worried we are about the injustice we're living in,"" she said.
    Kuczynski, 79, cited medical reasons for granting Fujimori the pardon and has said it was fundamentally about forgiveness. He denies it was part of a backroom deal.
    Rosa Rojas, who is also seeking a meeting with the pope, said she still struggles with the loss of her husband and eight-year-old son, who were killed in Fujimori's battle against the Shining Path rebels.
Combat between state security forces and the Shining Path and other guerrillas left an estimated 69,000 dead in Peru between 1980 and 2000, with 75 percent of victims comprised of indigenous people, according to Peru's truth commission.
    ""With the pardon, wounds that were healing have reopened,"" Rojas said.
'CORRUPTION IS THE PLAGUE'
    Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state, hinted strongly that the pope would address corruption during the trip. 
    Parolin, who ranks only second to the pope in the Church's hierarchy, told Vatican media that the pope feels fighting corruption is important because ""it blocks development and the overcoming of poverty"".
    During a previous trip to Latin American Francis said: ""Corruption is the plague, it's the gangrene of society"".
    But Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said there were no plans for the pope to meet the family members of Fujimori's victims.
    Despite his downfall, many Peruvians admire Fujimori, crediting him with pacifying Peru, fixing a broken economy and tending to the needs of the poor. Recent polls show that a majority of Peruvians support the pardon.
His populist following, led by daughter Keiko and son Kenji, remains one of the country's most potent political forces.
    Fujimori's supporters are also seeking a gesture of papal understanding for the pardon, but Church sources say that is unlikely.
    Human rights is expected to come up when Francis visits the Amazonian town of Puerto Maldonado to address increasing risks to the region's indigenous people - including reclusive tribes that shun contact with outsiders - from rampant wildcat gold mining, illegal logging and drug trafficking.
    ""Their territory is increasingly being invaded, their space is becoming smaller and smaller; the livelihoods with which they have survived for so many centuries are being destroyed,"" said Father Manuel Jesus Romero.
    ""Fishing, hunting, trees and rivers are more and more in danger. Therefore their lives are in danger,"" he told the newsletter of REPAM, a Pan-Amazonian Church Network. 

The South America trip will be 22nd overseas trip of Francis' pontificate and the sixth to the continent of his birth.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Congolese police fired teargas on Friday to disperse dozens of churchgoers who had gathered in the capital Kinshasa to mourn seven people killed in protests against President Joseph Kabila two weeks ago.
A Reuters cameraman who was filming the church service said police fired a volley of teargas outside, apparently to prevent the gathering turning into another political demonstration.
Scores have been killed in protests over Kabila's future in the past two years and militia violence has destabilized swathes of Congo, stoking fears the vast central African country will slide back into civil wars.
Security forces in Democratic Republic of Congo killed at least seven people in the capital on New Year's Eve during demonstrations that Catholic activists organized to protest Kabila's refusal to step down, the United Nations said. [nL8N1OV044].
The head of the Roman Catholic Church in Congo, Pierrot Mwanamputu, two days later condemned that repression as ""nothing more, nothing less than barbarism"". [nL8N1OX34U] The police, which admit killing only four people, described those killed as militants and gangsters.
The Catholic church, an institution that enjoys broad credibility in Congo, has emerged as a lightning rod for opposition to Kabila's efforts to stay in power with no mandate, while his political opposition remains weak and fragmented.
It brokered a deal between Kabila and the opposition at the end of 2016 under which an election would be held by early this year, but it has slipped again and is now loosely scheduled for the end of this year.
This has fueled suspicion that Kabila may try to remove constitutional term limits on continuing in office. 
""Our brothers and sisters died because they took a decision to remind us that (this) ... agreement must be respected,"" Donation Bafuidinsoni, the Auxiliary Bishop of Kinshasa told mourners at the service.
Its bishops are making ever louder criticism of human rights abuses by the government and alleged plans by Kabila to remove term limits stopping him from running for re-election -- Kabila has declined to comment on whether that is his intention. 
In power since his father was killed in office in 2001, Kabila blames delays on the logistics of voter registration.
""I don't know why they fired teargas at us. Truly, this government has to go,"" said a mourner fleeing the cloud of teargas who gave only her first name of Florence.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisian authorities arrested another 150 people including local opposition leaders on Friday, bringing the total detained close to 800 in response to demonstrations this week against price and tax rises.
Protests, some violent, flared across Tunisia on Monday, when one protester was killed, before ebbing on Thursday. Protesters have burned dozens of state buildings, prompting the government to send the army into several cities and towns.
Activists and opposition politicians appealed for fresh demonstrations in the capital, Tunis, on Friday and on Sunday, the seventh anniversary of the toppling of authoritarian president Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, the first leader to fall in the 2011 ""Arab Spring"" protests that swept the region.
On Thursday, unrest was limited to sporadic clashes in the northern city of Siliana, in Sidi Bouzid in central Tunisia and Douz in the south of the North African country. On Friday it was mostly quiet with just 200 people protesting peacefully in the capital, a witness said. 
""The protests have declined and there was no damage, but last night the police arrested 150 people involved in rioting in the past few days, bringing the total number of detainees to 778,"" Interior Ministry spokesman Khelifa Chibani said. Sixteen ""Islamist extremists"" were among those detained, he said.
The United Nations called on the government not to detain people arbitrarily.
""We're concerned about the high number of arrests, some 778 people we understand have now been arrested since Monday, and around a third of those arrested were between the ages of 15 and 20 so very young,"" U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters in Geneva.
""We call on the authorities to ensure that people are not arrested in an arbitrary manner and that all those detained are treated with full respect for their due process rights and are either charged or promptly released,"" he said.
Three local leaders of the Popular Front, the main opposition bloc, were detained in Gafsa for allegedly setting fire to a government building, a judicial source said. 
The Popular Front said its leaders had been targeted in a political campaign that was ""reproducing the methods of the oppressive Ben Ali regime"". Party members had also been arrested in Mahdia and Karbariya, it said.
The protests draw on anger over price and tax increases included in this year's budget that took effect on Jan. 1.
""TROUBLE MAKERS""
The government has blamed the opposition and ""troublemakers"" for stoking unrest, a charge the opposition has denied. The government has vowed not to back down on the austerity measures, taken to satisfy foreign lenders.
The authorities respected the right to protest but acts of vandalism were being brought under control, the government said in a statement.
Prices have increased for fuel and some consumer goods, while taxes on cars, phone calls, the internet, hotel accommodation and other items have also gone up.
Tunisia has been hailed as the only democratic success of the Arab Spring: the one Arab country to topple a long-serving leader in that year's uprisings without triggering widespread violence or civil war. Tunisian politicians were awarded the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize for achieving non-violent change.
But Tunisia has had nine governments since Ben Ali's overthrow, none of which have been able to resolve deep-rooted economic problems. The economy worsened since a vital tourism sector was nearly wiped out by a wave of deadly militant attacks in 2015, and has yet to recover despite improved security.
Tunisia appears to have little scope to back away from austerity. The International Monetary Funds says Tunisia is committed to ""decisive action"" to reform its economy before the IMF reviews the payment of its next loan tranche.
Last year, the Washington-based IMF agreed a four-year loan program worth about $2.8 billion with Tunisia, tied to economic reforms.

The 2018 budget also raises customs taxes on some imports, and the Tunis government is trying to cut the public sector wage bill through voluntary redundancies.

MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish government dismissed outright on Friday the possibility of former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont ruling the region from self-imposed exile in Brussels, and said Madrid would contest any attempt to do so in the courts.
Catalan separatists agreed on Wednesday to try to re-elect Puigdemont as regional leader, raising the scenario of the fugitive former leader governing by video link from Belgium. He faces arrest in Spain for sedition and rebellion.
""Parliamentary rules are very clear,"" said Spanish government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo at a weekly press conference. ""They do not contemplate the possibility of a (parliamentary) presence that is not in person.""
""This aspiration is a fallacy, it's totally unrealistic and it goes against the rule books and common sense,"" he added. 
Puigdemont spearheaded a movement last year for the wealthy northeastern region of Catalonia to split from Spain, culminating in Madrid sacking his administration and imposing direct rule. He moved to Brussels shortly afterwards.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held local elections in December to resolve the crisis, which has led to thousands of companies to move their registered headquarters to outside the region.
But the results of the vote delivered a slim majority to separatists, heightening the possibility of a renewed push for secession from Spain this year. 
Government lawyers have analysed Catalan parliamentary law and have concluded that any regional presidential candidate must appear in person in order to be voted in, Cadena Ser radio said on Thursday, citing a government legal report.
The regional parliament will sit for the first time on Wednesday to choose the parliamentary speaker. A new regional leader could be elected by parliament as soon as Jan. 31.
However, five members of the Catalan parliament, including Puigdemont, are in self-imposed exile in Brussels and three are serving custodial sentences in Madrid for their role in organizing an illegal referendum on independence from Spain.
Another possible candidate for regional president is Puigdemont's former deputy Oriol Junqueras, one of those in custody. However, a judge on Friday rejected his request to be transferred to a Catalan jail to be able to attend parliamentary sessions.

Under Spanish law, both Puigdemont and Junqueras could resign and pass their seat to another politician who could attend parliament or stand for president in their place.

1574,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 10:51AM ET</span>",Ancient statues looted in Lebanese war returned decades later,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A marble bull's head made 2,400 years ago for a Phoenician temple and looted during Lebanon's civil war arrived in Beirut on Friday after American officials found it in the United States and sent it home. 
The object - along with two partial statues that the United States is also returning - will be displayed in the National Museum in Beirut early next month, Lebanon's Culture Ministry said in a statement. 
They were stolen from a storehouse in Byblos in 1981 at the height of Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war, as Christian and Muslim militias battled each other across much of the country. 
In recent years, wars in Iraq and Lebanon's neighbor Syria have laid waste their cultural heritage and created a huge market in looted antiquities, helping to fund the jihadist militants of Islamic State. 
The Manhattan District Attorney's office in New York said last month it was returning the three statues to Lebanon and was forming an antiquities trafficking unit to stop the trade in looted artifacts.
The three pieces, all excavated during the 1960s and 1970s from the temple of Eshmoun in the port of Sidon and dating from between the fourth and sixth centuries BC, had been sold to private collectors in the United States. 
The bull's head was identified by a curator while on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art as being among the antiquities stolen in Lebanon. 
Located on the east coast of the Mediterranean, Lebanon was an important part of the classical world, home to the Phoenician civilization and part of the Persian and Roman empires. It has several major ancient sites. 
During the civil war, curators at its National Museum, which was located on a deadly front line, protected treasures that were not looted by sealing them up in the basement or encasing them in cement. 
Others were located in other sites around Lebanon, including to Byblos, an ancient port town north of Beirut, where the three items returned on Friday were stolen.

1575,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",UK's former Brexit campaign boss says no desire for a re-run of the EU referendum,"LONDON (Reuters) - British voters do not want a re-run of the referendum on European Union membership and any hint of another vote undermines the government's Brexit negotiations, the former CEO of Britain's main ""Leave"" campaign told Reuters.
Two of Britain's most prominent Brexit campaigners have endorsed a re-run of the referendum as a way to stop EU supporters from trying to water down or even halt Brexit.
In the United Kingdom's 2016 referendum, 51.9 percent, or 17.4 million people, voted to leave the EU while 48.1 percent, or 16.1 million people, voted to stay.
""There is no desire from the public for a second EU referendum,"" said Matthew Elliott, former chief executive of Vote Leave.
""Any hint of a second referendum will undermine the negotiations, because it will give [EU chief negotiator] Michel Barnier an incentive to present the UK with a bad deal, hoping that Britain votes to stay in, to continue our net contribution to the EU budget.""
Prime Minister Theresa May clinched a divorce deal last month that paves the way for arduous talks on future trade ties ahead of the United Kingdom's exit which is due on March 29, 2019.
Nigel Farage, one of the most prominent Brexit campaigners ahead of the referendum, said this week he was warming to the idea of holding a second vote to settle the argument on whether leaving was the right decision or not.
But Elliott, who led the official Leave campaign, said Farage was simply seeking publicity.
""Nigel Farage is clearly craving a publicity fix. He fears irrelevance and can’t stand not seeing his name in the headlines,"" Elliott said. 
""He should grow up, and realise that this issue is more important than any one person. It is about implementing the democratically expressed wishes of the British people in a serious and sensible way.""
Elliott praised May for her conduct of the negotiations which are now turning to the details of how Britain will trade with the world's biggest trading bloc after Brexit.
""Theresa May and her government are doing a good job in the negotiations and we should give them our full support,"" he said. ""Bickering and carping from the sidelines undermines the national interest at this important juncture in the talks.""
On Thursday, a ComRes poll for the Daily Mirror newspaper of 1,049 adults showed that although more people think there should not be a second referendum (51 to 43 percent), if there were to be a re-run, voters say they would opt to stay in the EU by 55 to 45 percent.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The head of Turkey's pro-Kurdish opposition on Friday made his first public appearance since his arrest 14 months ago, standing before an Istanbul court on charges of insulting President Tayyip Erdogan.
Several hundred people demonstrated near the courthouse in support of Selahattin Demirtas, a former human rights lawyer and the co-head of the Kurdish-rooted Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), parliament's third-largest party.
Demirtas had criticised Erdogan in a speech in December 2015, saying the president had ""fluttered from corridor to corridor"" during a conference in Paris, hoping to get a picture taken with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Those comments came after Turkish forces shot down a Russian warplane over Syria, when ties between the countries were at their worst since the end of the Cold War.
Demirtas, who won votes beyond his Kurdish core constituency in recent elections, faces up to four years in jail on the charges of insulting Erdogan. He faces 142 years in a different case on terrorism charges.
The HDP denies authorities' accusations of links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebel group, which has been fighting government forces in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The group is deemed a terrorist organisation by the United States, Turkey and Europe. 
LIMITS OF CRITICISM
The court has not allowed Demirtas to attend hearings for the other cases citing security reasons, and he has refused to take part via video link. 
On Friday he gave a brief statement to the court, objecting to the government's removal of the parliamentary immunity that he enjoyed as a lawmaker, which exempted him from investigation or prison while in office, according to the HDP.
The party described him as smiling and in high spirits. A Reuters reporter at the courthouse was not able to enter the courtroom. The case was adjourned until May 17.
Hundreds of supporters gathered across the street from the courthouse, chanting ""Selahattin Demirtas is our pride,"" and ""Shoulder to shoulder against fascism"".
""Our aim is to intimidate the ruling government, to show that HDP has not ended and the people siding with freedom are not gone,"" said one of the supporters, who declined to be identified.
Around 100 special police were posted outside the courthouse, armed with tear gas and automatic rifles.
A prosecutor charged that Demirtas's comments breached ""the limits of acceptable criticism,"" and were an ""unjust attack"" on Erdogan's personal rights.

In addition to Demirtas, nine other HDP members are detained, including its other co-leader, Figen Yuksekdag. They are mostly accused of links to the PKK. All deny the charges.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump canceled a trip to London scheduled for next month to open a new embassy, saying he did not want to endorse a bad deal agreed by the Obama administration to sell the old one for ""peanuts"".
The trip's cancellation is a further blow to relations between the close allies. More than a year into his presidency, Trump has yet to visit London, with many Britons vowing to protest against a man they see as crude, volatile and opposed to their values on a range of issues. 
The decision to move the U.S. Embassy from its current Grosvenor Square (NYSE:SQ) location in the upmarket Mayfair area of London and to a site on the south bank of the Thames was agreed in 2008 under the presidency of George W. Bush. [http://tmsnrt.rs/2DnVe8U]
However, Trump blamed former president Barack Obama for the sale, saying he would not attend the official opening of the new site. 
""(The) reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for 'peanuts,' only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars,"" Trump said in a tweet late on Thursday.
""Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!"" Trump said.
A pillar of Britain's foreign policy since World War Two, the ""special relationship"" with Washington has taken on added importance as Britain prepares to leave the European Union in 2019 and seeks new major trade deals. 
Prime Minister Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his inauguration in January last year, and they were filmed emerging from the White House holding hands. She later said Trump took her hand in a gentlemanly gesture as they walked down a ramp.
But British officials have been dismayed by some of Trump's pronouncements, particularly a proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States and most recently when Trump rebuked May on Twitter after she criticized him for retweeting British far-right anti-Islam videos.
During May's U.S. trip a year ago, she extended an invitation to Trump to make a formal state visit - which includes pomp, pageantry and a banquet with Queen Elizabeth.
May's spokesman told reporters Trump was welcome in London and that the invitation to visit had been accepted, although no date agreed. He said the opening of the embassy was a matter for the U.S. government.
""The U.S. is one of our oldest and most valued allies and our strong and deep partnership will endure,"" the spokesman said.
""HE'S GOT THE MESSAGE""
Many British politicians have voiced their opposition to Trump being granted a state visit, and say the invite should be recalled. 
""Many Londoners have made it clear that Donald Trump is not welcome here while he is pursuing such a divisive agenda,"" London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has often exchanged barbs with Trump on social media, tweeted. 
""It seems he's finally got the message.""
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said opponents such as Khan were putting the relationship with the United States, the biggest investor in Britain, at risk.
""We will not allow US-UK relations to be endangered by some puffed-up, pompous popinjay in City Hall,"" Johnson tweeted.
The American flag was this month removed from Grosvenor Square where the U.S. embassy has been based since 1938 with the area known as ""Little America"" during World War Two, when the square also housed the military headquarters of General Dwight D. Eisenhower.
It was also the scene of violence in 1968 when thousands of demonstrators protested against the U.S. war in Vietnam. 
In October 2008, the embassy was put up for sale and, the following year, sold to Gulf investor Qatari Diar. The purchase price was not disclosed. In 2009, it was given ""listed"" status which limits changes that can be made to the building's exterior because of its historical significance.
Woody Johnson, Trump's appointed U.S. ambassador to Britain, told reporters last month that moving to the new site at Nine Elms reflected ""the global outlook of the U.S. going forward in the 21st century: rather looking out, than looking in"".
""This isn't just a new office, though, it signifies a new era of friendship between out two countries. President Trump wants us to work more closely than ever with the UK,"" said Johnson, adding he hoped the president would attend the opening ceremony.
There had long been security concerns about the Grosvenor Square site, dating back to the late 1990s after attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa.
Some local residents had opposed measures that they felt would detract from one of London's plushest neighborhoods while others feared not enough was being done to ensure they would not be caught up in any attack.
The new embassy is a veritable fortress set back at least 100 feet (30 meters) from surrounding buildings - mostly newly-erected high-rise residential blocks - and incorporating living quarters for U.S. Marines permanently stationed inside.

The $1 billion construction was funded by the sale of other properties in London.

SIDI BOUZID, Tunisia (Reuters) - Shouting slogans and holding up placards outside a government office in the impoverished Tunisian city of Sidi Bouzid, university graduates have a message for officials - give us jobs or you will face trouble.
They are part of the spasm of anti-government unrest that spread nationwide this week, stoking another political crisis in a nation in turmoil as austerity bites hard under pressure from foreign lenders to get Tunisia's finances in order.
It was in Sidi Bouzid that mass protests erupted seven years ago and rapidly engulfed the rest of the North African country, sweeping away autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in the first of the Arab Spring uprisings.
Now the young men and women who spearheaded the outbreak of unrest in Sidi Bouzid are back in the streets of the dusty, dilapidated provincial city, complaining that they never reaped the benefits promised by the 2011 revolution.
Tunisia is the only democratic success story of the 2011 uprisings, with a unity government comprising secular centrists, moderate Islamists and independents, but - materially - most people are worse off than before.
Several deadly Islamist militant attacks have scared off much of the foreign tourism and investment critical to the economy, knocking the currency down 60 percent since 2011 and driving up inflation to a three-and-half-year high.
DISILLUSIONMENT
""We had hoped that our lives would become better, that we get jobs and housing, but everything has turned for the worse,"" said Bashir Hussein, one of the disgruntled graduates.
He is embarrassed that at 32 he still lives at home, unable to find a good job since graduation a decade ago - a fate shared by many in a country where unemployment among the young runs around 30 percent. ""I cannot afford to marry. I don't have hopes anymore that things will improve,"" Hussein said.
He and his friends had hoped the 2011 revolution would translate into new jobs in public services, which Ben Ali had steadily expanded to buy loyalty - Tunisia's spend on public wages is around 15 percent of GDP, one of the highest levels worldwide.
But that model has crumbled as a fall in phosphate exports due to blockages by protesters demanding jobs, as well as the decline in tourism revenue, have forced Tunisia to take on loans from the International Monetary Fund and Western countries.
Creditors want the government to stop spending almost two-thirds of the budget on public salaries and focus on education and infrastructure to create jobs over the long term.
The Sidi Bouzid protesters say authorities pledged to hire some 60 graduates from the town back in 2015 in what analysts say is a common gesture to discourage dissent. But the jobs have never transpired due to austerity-driven hiring freezes.
""We had a promise but officials have backtracked,"" Hussein said. ""We will keep protesting.""
The government has bowed to pressure from labor unions not to lay off civil servants, leaving no room for new hires.
To help fulfill foreign creditors' demands to lower the deficit, the Tunis government from Jan. 1 hiked taxes and prices affecting many common items from petrol to mobile phone calls, hitting the unemployed hardest.
While protests have been smaller than in 2011, investors and Western diplomats are concerned they could still pressure the government into watering down reforms, as before, to secure social peace.
Stoking such worries, the Islamist Ennahda party, part of the governing unity coalition, has endorsed calls from labor unions to roll back some of the reforms including subsidy cuts. 
""I suspect they will have to give in (at least partially) on the wage demands and postpone the hikes in prices,"" said Charlie Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital.
LACK OF MONEY RAISES GRAFT SUSPICIONS
Sidi Bouzid is located just 200 km (125 miles) inland from coastal Tunis but it takes four hours to reach the city of 300,000 people by car as there is no highway or railway service.
This forces motorists to rely on slow, pothole-ridden roads winding through village after village.
""We've demanded many times a link to the highway or railway so investors can come but we are told there is no money,"" said Attia Athmouni, an activist who was one of the first to call for protests in Sidi Bouzid after a young street vendor immolated himself when bribe-seeking police confiscated his fruit cart.
""The money is there. It is just not distributed to the people because we still have corruption,"" he said, pointing to crumbling housing as evidence of what he called graft siphoning off funds needed to invest in infrastructure.
Government officials deny such accusations and say Prime Minister Youssef Chahed has made it a priority to fight graft.
Eight officials have been jailed so far but parliament passed an amnesty last year for old, Ben Ali regime figures accused of graft, which upset many ordinary people.
With a public hiring freeze in place, some find work as farmhands but many youth spend the day idle in cafes.
DESPERATE RESORT TO LIBYA FOR JOBS
Many families used to get by on the earnings of male relatives working in neighboring oil-rich Libya until dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in a rebellion that was inspired by Tunisia's uprising but dragged the country into chronic chaos.
Most Tunisians have left Libya but with annual inflation for meat and other food items rising by more than 10 percent, some have returned despite the dangers posed by factional violence.
""I just came from Libya and will probably go back in two weeks,"" said 24-year old Mahran Alaoui, sitting with an employed friend in a Sidi Bouzid cafe. Alaoui said he works in a shop in on a coastal road in the western Libyan city of Zawiya notorious for shootouts between armed factions.
""There are risks in Libya but in Tunisia I can't find a job, and prices are very high,"" he said.
Athmouni, the protest activist, said thousands of youth had left Sidi Bouzid since 2011 seeking work abroad, often as illegal migrants going by boat to Europe, or joining Islamic State militants in Libya, Iraq or Syria.

""If you are desperate, people do anything,"" he said.

Such clashes occur weekly, but tensions have risen following U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on Dec. 6, which stirred anger across the Arab and Muslim world and concern among Washington’s European allies as well as Russia.
The move was welcomed by Israel.
""There is almost nothing left for the United States to do before it clearly declares a state of war against the Palestinian people, its authority and leadership,"" wrote commentator Rajab Abu Serreya in the widely-circulated Palestinian newspaper Al-Ayyam.
A total of 17 Palestinians and one Israeli have been killed in the flare-up since Trump's announcement, though analysts say neither Israel nor the Palestinians are interested in a major escalation.
A few hundred Gazans approached the border fence with Israel, throwing stones at soldiers who tried to disperse them by firing canisters of tear gas, according to Reuters video. Smaller crowds gathered in a couple of West Bank cities where protesters threw stones and burned tyres. Israeli soldiers fired tear gas and threw stun grenades.
East Jerusalem, which Palestinians want for the capital of a Palestinian state, was captured by Israel in the 1967 war and later annexed, though that action has not been internationally recognised. 
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have collapsed, partly due to Israeli settlement building on occupied land and to Israeli concerns over contact between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas which Israel considers a terrorist organisation.
Palestinian medical officials said 14 Palestinians were wounded by live ammunition in Friday's clash. An Israeli military spokeswoman said she was checking the reports.
""We want the Americans to know that the bloodshed here of unarmed people is on the hands of their president,"" said Ali, a 20-year-old university student in Gaza who did not want to give his family name.

1580,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",Eastward-looking Zeman is favorite as Czechs vote for president,"By Jason Hovet and Robert Muller
PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czechs started voting on Friday in the first round of a presidential election in which eight candidates are seeking to defeat incumbent Milos Zeman, whose brash style and leanings toward eastern powers have sharply divided opinion.
The vote, likely to end in a run-off in two weeks, is seen as a referendum on 73-year-old Zeman, in office since 2013, who has harshly criticized migration from Muslim countries and is keen to boost ties with Russia and China. 
Czech presidents have limited executive powers but previous incumbents have had a strong influence on public opinion. They also appoint central bankers and judges and are pivotal in forming governments -- a process the European Union and NATO member country is now going through.
A loss for Zeman to any of his main challengers could mean Czech public opinion may shift closer to the EU mainstream, in contrast to ex-communist neighbors such as Poland and Hungary whose governments have clashed with Brussels. 
A former center-left prime minister, Zeman has warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has called for the removal of EU sanctions imposed over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea.
He has also sought more trade with China and was the only western leader to attend a military parade in Beijing in 2015. But he has been criticized for ignoring Chinese human rights issues that Czech foreign policy had previously focused on. 
Zeman leads polls and should pick up a strong vote outside Prague and other cities on Friday and Saturday, but is expected to fall short of winning over 50 percent of the vote and may face a strong challenger in a run-off set for Jan. 26-27. 
First-round voting started at 2:00 p.m. (1300 GMT) on Friday and ends Saturday at the same time.
Zeman is a supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump and similarly boosts his appeal with sniping at the press and what he calls intellectual elites. He regularly holds voter meetings with crowds of people in smaller towns.
""I like that he speaks to voters,"" said Irena Matuskova, a Prague nurse who plans to vote for Zeman.
SECOND ROUND FOE
Zeman's most serious challenger is Jiri Drahos, 68, a chemical engineer and former head of the Czech Academy of Sciences who has campaigned on anchoring the Czech Republic's place in Europe.
Songwriter and businessman Michal Horacek, 65, could also vie for a spot in the run-off while support has risen for former center-right Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek and diplomat Pavel Fischer.
The outcome may influence Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis's chances of finally forming a cabinet as his first attempt to rule in a minority administration is likely to be rejected by parliament next week.
Zeman has backed Babis even as the billionaire businessman has struggled to get support from other political parties while he battles police allegations he illegally obtained EU subsidies a decade ago. Babis denies wrongdoing.
Babis said on Thursday he would vote for Zeman.
Zeman and Babis are among the most popular politicians in the country of 10.6 million that is largely eurosceptic and rejects accepting migrants from the Middle East and Africa. 
Among the leading candidates, Zeman has been the most outspoken on migration, linking Muslim immigration to security threats.

""What I would be afraid of is infiltration by jihadists, and thus a higher number of terrorist attacks in European countries or cities,"" he said on Thursday night in his weekly interview show, Week with the President, on TV Barrandov.

1581,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>","Israel's Netanyahu eyes trade, defense ties on India trip","By Rupam Jain
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu begins a six-day visit to India on Sunday hoping to boost trade ties and iron out differences arising from New Delhi's decision to scrap a defense deal, officials from both countries said.
Israel's state-owned defense contractor Rafael announced on Jan. 3 that India had canceled a $500 million order to buy its Spike anti-tank guided missiles. Indian media said Delhi would instead opt for home-made anti-tank missiles.
""If there is a problem, it can, it should and it will be solved,"" said Daniel Carmon, Israel's ambassador to India referring to the cancellation of the defense deal.
India is Israel's biggest arms market, buying around $1 billion worth of weapons every year. Despite the cancellation of the missile deal, India's Defence Ministry said this month it had cleared a plan worth $72 million to buy 131 Barak surface-to-air missiles built by Rafael.
The two countries have grown closer since Narendra Modi became Indian prime minister in 2014, widening commercial cooperation beyond their longstanding defense ties.
Netanyahu will be accompanied by a 130-member delegation drawn from the cyber and agriculture sectors as well as from defense. As well as New Delhi, they will also visit India's financial capital Mumbai and Modi's home-state of Gujarat.
""The intention of the prime minister and the whole delegation is to boost trade, investment and tourism between both countries,"" said Gilad Cohen, deputy director-general for Asia and the Pacific in Israel's foreign ministry.
Deals for gas and oil cooperation, cyber security and agricultural projects are on the agenda. 
PALESTINIANS
The trip comes about half a year after Modi became the first sitting Indian prime minister to visit Israel. On that trip Modi did not travel to the occupied West Bank to meet Palestinian leaders, as visiting leaders usually do..
However, India was among more than 120 countries last month to vote in favor of a resolution calling for the United States to drop its recent recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state.
Carmon said India's vote against Israel at the U.N. General Assembly on the Jerusalem issue would not affect bilateral ties.
""The vote at the UN is important, but it will not mar the big picture of the India-Israel relationship,"" he said.
Foreign policy experts in New Delhi said Modi had made significant changes in diplomatic and strategic ties with Israel while at the same time retaining links with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. 

Before Modi visited Israel in July 2017 he hosted Abbas in India and offered help in health and information technology, but the trip was low-key.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel struck a deal with Social Democrat (SPD) rivals on Friday to open government coalition talks, easing months of uncertainty that has undermined Germany's global role and raised questions about her political future.
But the deal to revive a ""grand coalition"" that has governed since 2013 must be approved by an SPD congress planned for January 21. Some members fear further association with Merkel's chancellorship could erode the influence of the party which suffered the worst result in September's election since the modern Federal Republic was founded in 1949.
""We have felt since the elections that the world will not wait for us, and in particular...we are convinced we need a new call for Europe,"" Merkel, who has played a central role tackling crises over the euro and refugees, said after exploratory talks that had run through the night. 
A 28-page blueprint pledged close co-operation with France to strengthen the euro zone. It also contained a promise, apparently targeting Saudi Arabia, a major buyer of German arms, not to export arms to countries involved in the war in Yemen.
The blueprint will form the basis for formal coalition talks if SPD members give the go-ahead, but it is open to revision.
Weakened by an election setback in September, Merkel turned to the left-leaning SPD to renew their grand coalition after the collapse in November of talks on a three-way coalition with the Greens and Free Democrats (FDP).
""DIFFICULT TASKS TO COME""
Germany is unfamiliar with the long negotiations that mark coalition building in many neighboring countries. The dominance of the SPD and the conservatives long ensured smooth government transition. But elections last September saw the rise of the right-wing Alternative for Germany which upset the arithmetic.
Merkel was eager to avoid any repeat election or attempt at a minority government.
""There will be difficult tasks to come,"" Merkel said. ""The coalition negotiations probably won't be easier than the exploratory talks.""
Horst Seehofer, head of the Bavarian sister party of Merkel's Christian Democrats, said a government could be in place by Easter - March or April.
As Europe's largest economy and pre-eminent power broker, Germany is crucial to the region's fortunes. Berlin's partners are eagerly awaiting a new government to help drive forward Brexit talks, euro zone reform and EU diplomatic initiatives.
France, which is pressing for a common euro zone budget to shield against external economic shocks, described the agreement as ""important for the stability and future of Franco-German relations, but especially Europe"". 
On the domestic front, the proposals reflected the strength of the economy. They foresaw tax relief for citizens of 10 billion euros over the three years to 2021 as well as extra spending on home-building, education and research.
The Finance Ministry said Germany had posted a budget surplus of 5.3 billion euros last year, adding the next government would have 45 billion euros' worth of financial ""wiggle room"" in the legislative period to 2021.
Officials said the surplus would be fed into a refugee reserve fund. More than a million migrants, many of them fleeing conflict in the Middle East, have arrived in Germany since mid-2015.
On foreign policy, the blueprint said the parties would introduce further limits on arms exports and immediately end arms sales to countries involved in the Yemen conflict. 
They would also rein in progress in EU accession talks with Turkey, which has come under strong criticism in western Europe over President Tayyip Erdogan's crackdown and widespread arrests following an attempted coup in 2016.
The euro climbed to a three-year high after news of the breakthrough in the talks. In early London trading, the euro rallied 0.7 percent against the dollar to hit its highest levels since January 2015 at $1.212.

Aldar Khalil, an architect of Kurdish-led plans for autonomous rule in northern Syria, also said the United States appears in ""no hurry"" to leave areas where it has helped Kurdish-led forces fight Islamic State, and that he expects ties with Washington to develop as U.S. recovery efforts proceed.
The Syrian Kurds are among the few winners in the almost seven-year-old war, having established control over large parts of the north with a powerful militia that has partnered with the U.S.-led coalition against IS.
Russia, President Bashar al-Assad's ally, has asked them to take part in an international peace conference on Syria for the first time -- a peace congress scheduled in the Russian city of Sochi on Jan. 29-30.
""Yes we are invited and we might take part in the show but it will not succeed,"" Khalil, co-chair of the Movement for a Democratic Society, a coalition of Syrian Kurdish parties, said by telephone.
He questioned what the hundreds of anticipated attendees could accomplish in two days and said more preparation was required.
U.N.-led diplomacy in Geneva was also set for more failure, he said, adding that the war would ""ebb and flow"" until at least 2021, the end of Assad's current seven-year presidential term.
""I don't expect any breakthrough in the Syrian situation before 2021 ... it might even go on until '25,"" he said.
""Daesh (IS) might expand in other areas, and of course the Turks might try to stir up problems in some areas.""
The Syrian Kurds' ascendancy in Syria has alarmed neighboring Turkey. Ankara views the dominant Syrian Kurdish groups as an extension of Kurdish parties in Turkey that have been fighting Ankara for more than three decades.
U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish fighters has also strained ties between the NATO allies: Turkey on Wednesday summoned a top U.S. diplomat in Ankara to protest over U.S. support of Kurdish fighters in Syria.
Khalil is seen as a key figure in plans to establish a federal region in northern Syria - a plan Washington has opposed despite backing the Syrian Kurdish YPG in the war with IS.
The Syrian Kurds say independence is not their goal. But Khalil said the Kurdish-led authorities would press ahead with unilateral autonomy plans, though elections to a new regional parliament have been postponed to allow more time to prepare.
WARNING TO ASSAD 
With the fight against IS winding down, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said last month he expected to see a larger U.S. civilian presence in Syria, including contractors and diplomats to focus on stabilization and ensuring IS does not return.
Khalil declined to say how long the United States might maintain a foothold in northern Syria, but said that achieving U.S. goals of helping cities such as Raqqa to recover implied a commitment of at least 18 months to two years.
""These matters will not be completed in less time than this,"" he said.
""I can't confirm to you a long-term relationship, but at least for the foreseeable time, it seems they are not in a hurry to leave,"" he said. Pointing to the Mattis remarks, he said he expected U.S. ties to northern Syria to develop further.
The Kurdish-led authorities have held two local elections since September, part of their plan to build new governing structures. Discussions are underway to decide when a third vote -- aimed at electing a regional parliament -- will happen.
Khalil said the delay was aimed partly at giving a chance for areas recently captured from IS to decide whether to participate.
Though Assad recently condemned the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces and their allies as ""traitors"", Khalil said the Syrian government was incapable of attacking areas they control and warned that if it tried to ""all its forces will be killed"".

He warned that Islamic State sleeper cells posed a big threat. ""The Daesh campaign is not over, now the more difficult phase has started,"" he said.

The guards demanded the resignation of the prison chief at Vendin-le-Vieil in northern France, where Christian Ganczarski hurt three guards with a pair of scissors late on Thursday. The guards also complained about what they see as insufficient staff and resources to handle dangerous inmates.
Ganczarski, a convert to Islam who visited the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, is nearing the end of a sentence handed down in 2009 over an attack in which militants killed 21 people at a synagogue on the Tunisian resort island of Djerba.
A senior prison service official said a significant number of prisons had been affected by the walkouts, which lasted 15-20 minutes.
""There is hate, they're fed up, they're bitter. Our colleagues go to work feeling sick with worry (about being attacked),"" said Jean-Francois Forget, a member of the Ufap-Unsa prison union. 
Prison guard sources say Ganczarski was informed a few days ago of plans to extradite him to the United States, where he is wanted over the airliner attacks that killed 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001 -- attacks that prompted the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and the killing of bin Laden by U.S. special forces.
The Vendin-le-Vieil prison, which is about 200 km (125 miles) north of Paris, is also where France plans to temporarily rehouse the main surviving suspect of an Islamist group that killed 130 people in Paris in November 2015 - Salah Abdeslam.
France is part of a U.S.-led coalition whose warplanes are bombing the Syrian and Iraqi bases of Islamic State, the militant group which has risen to dominance in al Qaeda's place since the killing of bin Laden in 2011. 
Footage aired at his 2009 trial in France showed Ganczarski in 2000 alongside bin Laden and Mohamed Atta, one of the leaders of the 9/11 attacks on New York. 
Police files seen by Reuters describe Ganczarski, who is of Polish descent but has German nationality, as the man who was in charge of al Qaeda's short-wave communications network.

1587,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 08:35AM ET</span>",Flare-up with Israel tests Hamas effort to keep Gaza on low boil,"By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Lee Marzel
ISRAEL-GAZA BORDER (Reuters) - The worst fighting on the Gaza Strip front since 2014 is being calibrated by Hamas, which wants to signal defiance of Israel and the United States while being careful not to trigger a new war for the enclave's penned-in Palestinians.
Since President Donald Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy on Dec. 6 by recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Palestinians in Gaza have launched 18 cross-border rockets or mortars - a third of all such attacks in 3-1/2 years of relative quiet.
For Israel's part, though residents in the south have raised a clamour for harsh retaliation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has counselled caution and targeted mostly unmanned Hamas facilities in night-time airstrikes.
The careful moves reflect the balancing act maintained both by Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza, and the Israeli government, old foes who share a reluctance to go to war again.
Gaza's neighbourhoods still bear the scars of the destruction caused by Israeli attacks during a seven-week conflict in 2014. In Israel, there is little eagerness to endure the daily sirens warning of rocket strikes.
But ordinary Israelis and Palestinians are keenly aware that even a single incident - a rocket causing multiple fatalities in Israel or Israeli forces killing a militant leader - could set off a conflagration that would be beyond their leaders' control.
Two Hamas gunmen have died in retaliatory Israeli air strikes and 15 protesters from Israeli gunfire.
""The recent weeks of rockets and Israeli bombardment proved an explosion is possible,"" said Gaza political analyst Akram Attalla. ""How long will Hamas continue to take Israeli strikes to its positions without a response? And how long will Israel's Netanyahu tolerate internal criticism? There is no guarantee."" 
While there have been no Israeli fatalities or serious injuries in the rocket strikes, farmers in communities close to the Gazan border think twice about tilling fields where they might be exposed and children practice duck-and-cover drills should air raid sirens sound.
""Lately we do feel that there is more presence of the army. We have been told to be more careful, to clear the bomb shelter just in case. You never know when the next rocket will come,"" said Hila Fenlon, resident of the farm collective Nativ Haasara. 
Hamas has responded to Trump's move by mobilising mass protests at the border and turning a blind eye to other factions firing into Israel in two weeks of daily attacks, which have tailed off recently. 
""This saves face for Hamas, as it appears to be the one that stands behind these protests without the need to go to war,"" said Attalla.
A more violent response was tamped down in debate among Palestinian factions who agreed that an armed confrontation could erode the international support Palestinians have won diplomatically and shift attention from the political process.
Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said no-one should underestimate the potential for hostilities to resume under what he called an Israeli occupation, however.
Israel withdrew troops and settlers from the territory in 2005 but remains the conduit for the passage of goods and supplies most of its electricity. Israel and Egypt, citing security concerns, maintain tight restrictions on the passage of Palestinians through their borders with the enclave. 
""The situation in Gaza is very difficult and is not tolerable and is doomed to explode,"" he told Reuters.
IRANIAN SUPPORT
Israel sees an outside catalyst for the violence - Iran, which both Hamas and its sometime ally Islamic Jihad say has pledged unlimited assistance for them as the Syrian civil war, where Tehran deployed reinforcements for Damascus, winds down. 
Israel has gone out its way to blame Islamic Jihad and other groups for the rocket and mortar attacks, rather than Hamas, and even gave grudging credit to Hamas for being mindful of Palestinian civilian needs.
""Calls to respond with full force against Hamas are irresponsible,"" the top Israeli general, Gadi Eizenkot, said in a speech last week. He noted Gaza's ""danger of humanitarian collapse"", which, he said, had forced Hamas to engage with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and secured a renewed power supply to the enclave.
Israel also has problems elsewhere. 
Having neutralised much of the rocket threat from Gaza with their Iron Dome interceptor system, and hard at a work on an underground wall that would block guerrilla tunnels from the territory, Israeli defence officials say they worry more about Iran and the combustible northern front with Syria and Lebanon.
They also fear that the $1.1 billion sensor-equipped barrier on the 60-km (37-mile) frontier could tempt Gaza militants to use their tunnels to strike Israel before they lose them. 
A range of economic initiatives have been broached, from the construction of an island off Gaza to handle direct imports by sea to the issuing of more permits for Palestinian labourers or agricultural exports to enter Israel. 
""There is an effort to help the (Palestinian) population in a way that will not go to the armed wing of Hamas,"" said Amos Yadlin, a former Israeli military intelligence chief and head of Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies, which has prepared a 180-page memorandum on the Gaza crisis.
Israeli concern about worsening Gaza's internal problems has put it at odds even with the Trump administration, which has threatened to cut U.S. contributions to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) that provides essential aid for Palestinian refugees in the enclave, supporting and administering hundreds of schools and dozens of health facilities.
Israel says funds should be cut gradually and UNRWA should ultimately be dismantled and its responsibilities transferred to the United Nations' global refugee agency. 
Cutting aid to UNRWA would spell ""huge pressures on Gaza's residents,"" said Saleh Naami, another Palestinian political analyst.
Peter Lerner, a former Israeli military spokesman, agreed.

""While UNRWA is far from perfect, the Israeli defence establishment, and the Israeli government as a whole, have over the years come to the understanding that all alternatives are worse for Israel,"" he said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Having seen a court disqualify her friend from holding a seat in Hong Kong's legislature, 21-year-old Agnes Chow stands ready to step into the breach by contesting his seat for a pro-democracy movement that has provoked China's wrath.
""We can't afford to be scared,"" said the soft-spoken university student, who will announce her candidacy on Saturday.
""People think if they don't touch politics they will be fine but this is not the case anymore,"" Chow told Reuters, referring to what she perceived as creeping interference by Beijing's Communist Party rulers in the city's freedoms.
If she wins the Hong Kong Island constituency in March, Chow will become Hong Kong's youngest ever lawmaker.
The by-election is one of several necessitated after the Chinese parliament issued a legal interpretation that eventually led to the debarring of six opposition lawmakers, leaving the pro-democracy camp with 24 seats in the 70-seat legislature and also effectively taking away some of its veto powers under Hong Kong's complex system. 
Chow's friend Nathan Law, 24, was one of the disqualified lawmakers. 
During the coming week, Law, along with several other opposition leaders like 21-year-old Joshua Wong, will return to the courts, defending their role in the largely peaceful protests that blocked major roads in the former British colony for 79 days in 2014.
The High Court could jail Wong and 19 other protesters, with sentencing expected on Wednesday, while in a separate hearing Law is appealing an eight-month jail term that he has already partially served before being released on bail.
""When my friends are going to jail for defending democracy ... I keep thinking, 'how can I do more and take up more responsibility?',"" said Chow, who has been a student leader since 2012. 
""It forces us to grow.""
ANXIOUS TIMES 
Hong Kong has been governed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997, allowing freedoms not enjoyed on mainland China that include an independent judiciary but not a fully democratic vote.
The failure of the ""Umbrella Movement"" protests to wrestle concessions on democracy from Beijing, coupled with prosecutions of at least 100 protesters, mostly youths, discouraged many young people from going back out on the streets. 
The street occupations also prompted the Chinese government to tighten control of the city, and there is little sign that Beijing is winning favor with Hong Kong's young.
In the latest survey conducted by the University of Hong Kong of 130 youths, only 0.3 percent identified themselves as ""Chinese,"" a new low since polling began in 1997.
On the flip side, around 70 percent of respondents - the highest ever - saw themselves as ""Hong Kongers"".
Several civil disobedience leaders from 2014 studied or taught at the university, but while the survey showed where sentiments lay its student body has become less politically active, to a point where no one wants to lead the student union. 
""Everyone feels numb,"" said incumbent union president Wong Ching-tak. ""The issues keep coming but you can't do anything, and if you do something you face imprisonment.""
While recent protests have failed to garner huge numbers, some activists say the pressure for change is slowly brewing beneath the surface.
""I don't necessarily think we'll see a revolution with big fanfare, but an underground community that slowly expands,"" said Yau Wai-ching, 26, who was ousted from the legislature. 
""And this community takes a different stance against the government ... This can be a revolution too.""

1590,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>","In rut, Russian communists register surprise candidate to challenge Putin","By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian Communist Party moved to overhaul its geriatric image on Friday, registering a wealthy 57-year-old farm boss to challenge incumbent Vladimir Putin for the presidency in a gamble it hopes will revive its electoral fortunes.
Russia's central election commission on Friday said it had registered Pavel Grudinin, who runs a farm business on the edge of Moscow, as the party's candidate for the March 18 election after the communists unexpectedly decided against putting up their veteran 73-year-old leader Gennady Zyuganov. 
Backed by state TV, the ruling United Russia party, and many voters who live outside big cities, polls show 65-year-old Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for the last 18 years, is on track to comfortably win a fourth presidential term.
Grudinin, a fresh face in an otherwise stale political line-up that has hardly changed in the last two decades, could indirectly help Putin by boosting turnout amid signs of apathy among some voters who assume Putin will win however they vote. 
Though a shadow of itself in the Soviet era when it enjoyed a monopoly on power, the Communist Party is also hoping a younger less orthodox contender may be able to revive its fortunes and appeal to younger voters. 
The party has seen its share of the vote in post-Soviet presidential elections more than halve from a high of almost 41 percent or around 30 million votes in 1996. In the last election, in 2012, it won just over 12 million votes. 
Yet it remains popular with millions of Russians, particularly older people who live in rural communities, retains a nationwide network, and regularly comes second to the ruling party in elections.
UNORTHODOX COMMUNIST 
Grudinin is not a typical communist candidate.
Zyuganov, who the party has fielded unsuccessfully in four presidential elections, is known for hard line communist views, his frequent quoting of Soviet revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, and once called for the re-Stalinisation of society. 
Grudinin, a former Putin supporter, makes jokes, is open about the fact that he earns 20 million rubles ($353,773.17) a year, says modern communists should learn from the USSR's mistakes, and advocates Russia borrowing some aspects of Chinese-style communism. 
Observers have noticed another big difference.
While Zyuganov in recent years would criticize the ruling United Russia party, he was careful, in the tightly-controlled political system, not to harshly criticize Putin. 
Grudinin has been less coy, accusing Putin of making empty promises and suggesting he has been in power too long, even comparing him to veteran Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev whose lengthy rule became synonymous with decay.
""When General Secretary Brezhnev sat in his post (for too long) it was bad,"" Grudinin told a state TV talk show last month. ""Why are we repeating the same mistake?""

Parties across the political spectrum have unveiled a colorful array of policies ahead of the March 4 vote, which is unlikely to give any one group a mandate to govern alone.
Tax cuts, more public spending and changing European Union budget rules have become a clarion call for all major parties, and several have promised benefits for the poor. 
But, when asked in a poll by Index Research which electoral promises they preferred and believed would become reality, 78.6 percent of people replied ""none"" of them.
According to the poll, broadcast on Thursday evening by TV channel La7, tax reduction was the most appealing and credible pledge, chosen by an optimistic 6.9 percent. 
Reversing planned increases to the retirement age, championed by the right-wing Northern League and partially backed by its ally, Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, gained favor with 3.5 percent of respondents.
Just 2.1 percent opted for the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement's ""citizen's wage"", a minimum income scheme which is echoed by Forza Italia and the governing Democratic Party.

Meanwhile, a chunky 36.4 percent told Index Research they would not vote at all.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - The European Union warned Kosovo on Friday that its relations with the bloc will suffer if it scraps a war crimes court linked to its bloody independence struggle.
The EU's message, echoing one by the United States last month, came amid uncertainty as to whether Kosovo's parliament will put a vote on the court back on its agenda next week after shelving it on Dec. 22 under U.S. and EU pressure. 
""This initiative, still pending before the Kosovo parliament, is of extreme concern to the EU and its member states,"" the EU office in Pristina said in a statement. ""This would adversely impact Kosovo relations with the EU.""
Envoys from Germany and France arrived in Pristina this week to try to lobby Kosovo leaders to drop any move to abolish the Specialist Chamber set up in 2015 to try ex-Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas alleged to have committed atrocities in the 1998-99 war that led to independence from Serbia.
It has yet to hear any cases.
Kosovo media have said the court, based abroad in The Hague, could indict or call as witnesses some current government officials. It was set up in the Netherlands to minimize the risk of witness intimidation and judicial corruption. 
Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, President Hashim Thaci and parliamentary speaker Kadri Veseli are former KLA commanders.
The court's judges and prosecutors are foreigners, but authorities in Kosovo have jurisdiction as it was established under Kosovo law. 
The United States told Pristina last month the overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian country in the western Balkans would face ""isolation"" if it abolished the court.
Washington is Kosovo's staunchest ally but the European Union's warning also carries weight as the small, impoverished nation hopes for eventual closer ties to the wealthy bloc.
NATO air strikes on Serbia forced it to withdraw troops from Kosovo in 1999 and the U.S.-led alliance keeps 5,000 soldiers there to maintain a fragile peace. More than 100 countries, but not Serbia, recognized Kosovo's independence in 2008.
Between 10,000 and 12,000 people, mainly ethnic Albanians, were killed in the conflict between the KLA and security forces loyal to then-nationalist Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. A small Serb minority remains in Kosovo.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Several hundred Indonesian Islamists held a protest rally outside Facebook's headquarters in Jakarta on Friday, accusing the social media giant of discrimination for blocking some pages operated by hardline groups for allegedly spreading hate. 
The protesters, many dressed in white and including members of the hardline Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), marched from a mosque to Facebook's offices in the capital of the world's biggest Muslim-majority country.
""We want to remind Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to remain neutral and balanced,"" Slamet Maarif, a spokesman for FPI, told reporters. 
""There are many accounts that spread hate about Islam, ulamas, that are allowed to operate. There are accounts that talk about Islamic humanitarian aid, those are blocked,"" said Maarif, adding that the group still planned to use Facebook and intended to open new accounts.
Facebook said its policy was to delete content that violated its community standards.
""Our community standards are made to prevent organizations or individuals that urge hate speech or violence against those who hold different views,"" said a company representative, who declined to be identified.
A spokesman for Indonesia's communications ministry, Semuel Pangerapan, said, ""We have never requested that FPI's accounts be closed.""
Some Islamist groups in Indonesia use social media extensively and FPI usually has about 100 accounts on Facebook, as well as on other social media platforms such as Twitter.
The rally was peaceful, though more than 1,200 police officers were brought in to guard the offices, media said.
Indonesians are avid users of social media and Facebook had 115 million users in the second quarter of 2017, according to media citing its country manager, ranking the country fourth globally after the United States, India and Brazil.
Some of the protesters on Friday made live video streams of the rally to air via Facebook. 
The vast majority of Indonesians practice a moderate form of Islam, though a reputation for religious tolerance has come under scrutiny as hardline groups muscle their way into public and political life in the young democracy.
President Joko Widodo has expressed concerns over hoax stories and hate speech spread online and has pledged to ""clobber"" any group threatening to destroy Indonesia’s tradition of pluralism and moderate Islam. 
At a rally late last year in Jakarta by Muslims opposing U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a body of Muslim clerics urged a boycott of U.S. and Israel products if Trump did not revoke his action. 

So far there has been no indication the measure will gain traction and Indonesia's vice president said calls to stop using U.S. goods and technology were misguided.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A U.N. contingency plan for an earthquake in Indonesia foresees a scenario where 10,000 people would die within 24 hours with 47 million more affected, according to emergency response planning documents.
The U.N.-led exercise to prepare for disaster in one of the world's most quake-prone regions, is based on a magnitude 7.8 quake in the Sunda Strait, close to the capital Jakarta, similar in size to one that struck the Caribbean this week.
""Within the first 24 hours, approximately 10,000 deaths with a substantial number of missing people is reported,"" said the contingency plan based on a worst-case scenario.
A further 60,000 people would be seriously injured and 200,000 lightly injured, while 9.6 million would be temporarily displaced. Although 2.5 million people would need immediate help, fewer than one in 10 would get it.
Electricity and telephone networks would go down for as long as two weeks, and large scale oil and chemical spills would cause fires and disrupt fuel supplies for a week after the quake. There would be major disruption to air and sea ports.
In 2004 the Indian Ocean tsunami killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Since then, a culture of disaster prevention has spread around the world, said Denis McClean, spokesman for the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction.
Indonesia has established disaster management agencies at national and local levels and a tsunami warning system, he said. But as in most earthquake-prone countries, it needed to improve building regulations.
""It is buildings which kill in earthquakes,"" McClean said.
The scenario, which assumes an earthquake affecting west Java and Sumatra with no tsunami, was developed by Indonesia's geophysics and meteorological agency BMKG, based on a huge 1699 earthquake in Batavia, the location of modern-day Jakarta.
Further scenario modeling should look into multiple disasters such as a tsunami or flooding in a big city, bringing in more accurate data on damaged buildings and infrastructure, the documents said. 
The World Bank reckons natural disasters cost Indonesia 0.3 percent of its GDP annually, but a 2015 report on disaster risk management prepared by Indonesia's government said a major earthquake, occurring once every 250 years, could cause losses in excess of $30 billion, or 3 percent of GDP.
In December a 6.5 magnitude quake killed at least three people when it hit Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, at a depth of 92 km (57 miles), and buildings in Jakarta swayed for several seconds.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A stricken Iranian oil tanker continued exploding on Friday, hampering rescue efforts, Chinese state media reported, as Japan's Coast Guard said the ship drifted away from the Chinese coast and into Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
The ship, which has been ablaze for almost a week since it collided with another vessel on Saturday night in the East China Sea, was about 286 km (178 miles) northwest of Sokkozaki on the island of Amami Oshima as of 0700 GMT on Friday, the Japan Coast Guard said in a statement.
The vessel is drifting to the southwest at a speed of 2.2 km (1.4 miles) per hour, the Coast Guard said. 
Amami Oshima is one of the northern islands in the Ryukyu islands chain that includes Okinawa.
There have been continuous explosions onboard the ship, China's official Xinhua news agency said late on Friday, citing the Ministry of Transport.
The tanker Sanchi (IMO:9356608), owned by Iran's top oil shipping operator National Iranian Tanker Co, was carrying almost 1 million barrels of condensate, an ultra-light, highly flammable crude oil, to South Korea.
It collided with the freighter CF Crystal (IMO:9497050) that was carrying grain from the United States about 160 nautical miles (184 km) off China's coast near Shanghai.

The Coast Guard has sent patrol boats and aircraft to monitor the situation, said a spokesman for the Japan Coast Guard's 10th region based in Kagoshima.
Fourteen ships are carrying out emergency response work, including one from Japan and two from South Korea, the transport ministry said in a statement released late on Friday.
The Sanchi had a crew of 32 sailors at the time of the collision. The body of a mariner suspected to be from the ship was recovered on Monday and sent to Shanghai for identification. The rest of the crew, which included 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis, remains missing.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Bulgaria parliament overturns presidential veto on anti-corruption law,"By Angel Krasimirov
SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria's parliament on Friday overturned a presidential veto on anti-graft legislation, clearing the way for the creation of a special unit to investigate individuals occupying high public office as well as assets and conflicts of interest.
Last week Bulgarian President Rumen Radev vetoed the law, passed by parliament, saying the bill failed to offer the means to effectively investigate corruption networks.
Bulgaria has made scant progress towards stamping out graft and organized crime, and the European Commission, the EU's executive, has repeatedly rebuked the Black Sea country for failing to prosecute and sentence allegedly corrupt officials.
Some analysts say the fact that the new unit's management will be appointed by parliament means it might not be truly independent and could be used by those in power to persecute opponents.
But the motion to overrule the veto was passed by 146 votes in the 240-seat parliament, bringing together lawmakers from the ruling center-right GERB party, allies in the nationalist United Patriots formation and opposition deputies from the Movement for Rights and Freedoms and Volya. The Socialists voted against.
""Today, by rejecting the president's veto, our country will fulfill a commitment to the European Commission,"" GERB's parliamentary group leader Tsvetan Tsvetanov told lawmakers.
The moves allows the government to pursue plans to focus on improving control and accountability of law-enforcement agencies to try to change opinions and clean the Balkan country's tarnished image during its EU presidency.
Radev acted only a day after the European Union's poorest country assumed the six-month, rotating presidency of the bloc for the first time since it joined the EU in 2007.
According to Transparency International, Bulgaria is the EU's most corrupt country.
Corruption has deterred foreign investment since communism collapsed in Bulgaria in 1989, and the EU has kept Sofia as well as neighboring Romania - for the same rule-of-law failings - outside its Schengen zone of passport-free travel.
""The president's veto was like the last chance to adjust your policy on corruption,"" Kornelia Ninova, leader of the main opposition Socialist Party, said in parliament.
On Thursday several demonstrations, some with an anti-corruption theme, blocked Bulgarian capital Sofia as the country hosted official ceremonies for the start of its EU presidency.

Neighboring Russia carried out seven thorough inspections in the past two weeks on Finnish ships at St Petersburg and other ports, without giving a specific reason, a government minister said on Friday.
Such inspections usually take place for Finnish ships only a few times a year globally.
""The inspections have been exceptional ... It is a challenge for the shipping companies, it makes their operation more difficult,"" Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner told Reuters.
""There have been inspections by Russian ports for ships from other countries as well, but in this time range, most of the inspections have been carried out on Finnish ships.""
The Russian transportation ministry declined to comment but Berner said that seafaring authorities from the two countries had held discussions, with talks due to continue next week.
""It seems these inspections will not continue for the time being. We will confirm this on Monday in a call between ministries"", Berner said.
EU-member Finland shares a 1,340km (833 miles) border and a difficult history with Russia. It has accused Moscow of several airspace violations and propaganda attacks in recent years.
Finnish media have suggested the increase in Russian port inspections could be in response to an inspection by Finland on a Russian cargo ship in November because of an oil leak.
Berner described such claims as speculation.
""There is no evidence of connection (to Finland's inspection),"" the minister said.

Under international seafaring law, inspectors can hold a ship back at ports if it lacks certificates or poses some kind of security threat.

Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano made the announcement a day after President Rodrigo Duterte's spokesman said no action would be taken by the presidential palace regarding the statue, despite Tokyo's objection.
A spokeswoman from Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday it was ""extremely regrettable"" that comfort women statues, including the one in the Philippines, had been erected.
Cayetano said the existence of the monument, which commemorates the 1,000 Filipino women who were forced to work in Japanese military brothels during World War Two, ""will really affect certain feelings and relationships.""
Duterte's spokesman on Thursday said the statue was not an issue for the president to get involved in downplaying concern it could hurt ties with Japan.
Cayetano said his department was never consulted about the project approved by a government agency, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP). The monument was built just a few blocks from the headquarters of the foreign ministry.

The panel will be composed of representatives from the foreign and public works ministries, the city government of Manila, the capital, and the NHCP.

The submarine was first detected on Thursday in waters contiguous to Japan's territory around the islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, but was finally identified on Friday, the Defence Ministry said, a day after Japan lodged a protest with China over the presence of a frigate in the same area.
Neither entered what Japan considers its territorial waters.
Japan and China have long been at loggerheads over the tiny, uninhabited islands. They are controlled by Japan but claimed also by China. 
""The presence of the submarine in Japan's contiguous waters, along with that of the frigate, has unilaterally raised tensions. We are deeply concerned,"" Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera told reporters.
Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Shinzuke Sugiyama telephoned China's ambassador to Japan, Cheng Yonghua, to lodge a strong protest and demand measures be taken to prevent a repeat, the ministry said in a statement. 

China routinely rejects Japanese criticism of such patrols, saying its ships have every right to operate in what China calls its territorial waters.

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>",Four judges of India's top court criticize its functioning,"By Malini Menon and Suchitra Mohanty
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Four justices of India's top court on Friday criticized its distribution of cases to judges and raised concerns about judicial appointments, in an unprecedented public airing of problems at one of the country's most respected institutions.
The move spells far-reaching implications for jurists and politicians in the chaotic South Asian democracy where the Supreme Court often sets the agenda on matters of policy and orders measures taken in the public interest. 
Exposing a rift with Chief Justice Dipak Misra, some of the Supreme Court's most senior judges told a news conference the issues involving its administration were serious enough to prompt them to go public.
""The four of us are convinced that unless this institution is preserved and it maintains its equanimity, democracy will not survive in this country,"" Justice Jasti Chelameswar said on the lawns of his residence in the Indian capital. 
The justices gave few details of the incidents they were referring to, but released a letter they had written to Misra. 
In the letter, they mentioned instances of cases with ""far-reaching consequences for the nation and the institution"" that were selectively assigned by the chief justice without any rational ""basis for such assignment"". 
All Supreme Court judges should be involved in setting the procedures used to hire and promote judges in various courts in the country, including the high courts, they added.
Reuters could not immediately reach the chief justice for comment. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad declined to comment.
Two close aides of Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was looking into the matter and had summoned top law ministry officials for consultations. 
SPEAKING UP 
Some Supreme Court lawyers praised the justices' action. 
""Looking at its own flaws is the first step to correcting an institution, to deepening true constitutional democracy,"" said Karuna Nundy, a Supreme Court lawyer.
The Supreme Court has 25 judges appointed by India's president, including the chief justice, and each retires at the age of 65, the court says on its website.
The four justices at Friday's news conference - besides Chelameswar, they included Ranjan Gogoi, Madan Lokur and Kurian Joseph - are the most senior after Misra.
Three of them are scheduled to retire this year, while Gogoi is in line to be the next chief justice, based on seniority.
Efforts to alert the chief justice that certain things were not in order and that remedial measures were needed had failed, prompting the news conference, Chelameswar said.

The justices did not want to be accused of not having spoken up for the institution, or of ""selling their souls"", he added.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 04:51AM ET</span>","Korea talks ease war fears in Washington, but for how long?","By John Walcott and David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Talks between North and South Korea ahead of next month's Winter Olympics have eased fears of war over Pyongyang's development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States - at least for now.
But North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has shown no sign of willingness to give in to U.S. demands and negotiate away a weapons program he sees as vital to his survival, so any reduction in tensions could prove shortlived.
Rhetoric on all sides may have moderated as a result of the first round of intra-Korean talks in more than two years on Tuesday, but U.S. officials say hawks in President Donald Trump's administration, up to and including Trump himself, remain pessimistic that they will lead anywhere.
In recent days, in a series of media leaks, U.S. officials have spoken of the president's willingness to consider a limited preemptive strike on North Korea to change Kim's mindset, despite the risk of touching off a war.
But there are divisions within the administration.
National security adviser H.R. McMaster has been the most vocal of Trump's aides arguing for a more active military approach, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the military leadership have urged caution, stressing the need to exhaust diplomatic options, according to five officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
A White House National Security Council official said the administration was ""constantly developing a range of options, both military and non-military"" but declined to address any differences between senior aides.
The Pentagon declined comment on internal discussions, though one spokesman said Mattis had stressed in public that the effort to confront the North Korean crisis was diplomatically led. The State Department referred to Tillerson’s statements on the need to pursue diplomacy backed by strong military options.
According to the narrative put forth by those advocating a tougher response, a strike could be limited to a single target with the aim of making Kim see reason, not to topple his government, something North Korea's neighbor and only major ally, China, would not countenance, the officials said.
""Trump is convinced the only thing Kim understands and respects is a punch in the face, which he thinks no previous administration has had the guts to do,"" one U.S. official said.
""At a minimum, he thinks that warning the Chinese about a preemptive strike would motivate Beijing to force Kim to shut down the programs that threaten the U.S.,"" the official said.
It remains unclear whether these disclosures by people close to the internal deliberations were simply psychological warfare aimed at sowing strategy-changing fear within the North Korean leadership or reflected Trump's serious intent.However, the administration's debate on whether to put greater emphasis on strike plans has slowed because of the North-South contacts and February's Winter Olympics to be hosted by South Korea. Pyongyang said it would send a delegation.
Some U.S. officials have suggested that North Korea was using diplomatic overtures to try to drive a wedge between Washington and ally Seoul and did not intend to engage seriously. The South and the United States are technically still at war with the North because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.
A new dawn: http://tmsnrt.rs/2Ar8lUu
'WHO KNOWS WHERE IT LEADS?'
Trump's public response to the intra-Korean meeting has been mostly positive though at times tinged with skepticism.
""Who knows where it leads?"" he told reporters on Wednesday after discussing the talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a long-time advocate of dialogue with Pyongyang and whose capital Seoul could be devastated in any major conflict.
Trump, who has exchanged insults and threats with Kim in recent months, was quoted on Thursday as telling the Wall Street Journal in an interview: ""I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un."" Trump offered no details and asked whether he had spoken with Kim, said: ""I don't want to comment on it. I'm not saying I have or I haven't.""
The administration had been due to hold a Cabinet-level meeting this week to sharpen its economic and military options for dealing with North Korea.
But officials say this discussion has been postponed until after the Paralympic Games, which follow the Olympics and end in March, given the intra-Korean talks and a planned 20-country meeting on North Korea hosted by Canada next week.
The Vancouver meeting, aimed at increasing the U.S.-led pressure campaign against Pyongyang, was announced by Washington just after North Korea's last intercontinental ballistic missile test in late November.
One U.S. official said one option would be to bomb a North Korean missile or nuclear facility based on a ""high confidence"" intelligence assessment that North Korea planned another test. Such a strike could be triggered by evidence that North Korea was fueling an ICBM, the official said. Another option would be a retaliatory strike on an ICBM or nuclear site after a test, another official said.
The officials said McMaster has argued that if China were assured that a strike would be limited to one target and not the beginning of a campaign to overthrow Kim, an all-out war could be avoided.
Chinese political experts said China was opposed to even limited strikes.
However, Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing, said China's attitude might change if North Korea launched a nuclear-tipped ICBM into the Pacific Ocean or fired missiles toward Guam.
China sees the Trump administration's discussion of military options as a psychological game to force Beijing and Moscow to maintain pressure on Pyongyang, but they were making crisis preparations just in case, Zhao said.
""Even if Trump is not really serious about a military strike, there is always the risk of miscalculation or an over-reaction from North Korea,"" Zhao said.
A South Korean official said Seoul believed the chance of a U.S. strike was still low. ""President Trump is aware of the consequences. He's been advised by a lot of agencies and departments of the damage it would cause and the number of victims,"" the official said.
The prevailing view at the State Department is that military action is not worth the huge risk, a senior U.S. official said. 
However, the official said, ""there are military options that could achieve benefits we consider in our national interest at a cost we are willing to bear.""
The consensus among U.S. intelligence agencies is Kim is convinced Washington seeks to overthrow him and only a nuclear arsenal can deter that.
A Japanese ruling party lawmaker said he did not believe the Korean talks could narrow the gap between North Korea's demand for recognition as a nuclear-armed state and the U.S. refusal to accept that. 

""It may be dangerous after the Olympics,"" the lawmaker said.

In the first major industrial upheaval of 2018, the shutdown of the Athens metro, used by some 938,000 commuters daily, caused traffic gridlock in the city of 3.8 million people. 
Ships were unable to sail as workers went on strike and state-run hospitals had to rely on reserve staff as doctors walked off the job. More work stoppages were expected on Monday.
The bill pending approval in parliament on Monday would reduce family benefits, introduce a new process for foreclosures on overdue loans and make it harder to call a strike.
It has outraged many Greeks, who have seen living conditions and incomes plummet since the country first sought international aid to stave off bankruptcy in 2010, and required another two bailouts thereafter. 
At present, unions can call strikes with the support of one-third of their members. The new law would raise that to just over 50 percent, which creditors hope would limit the frequency of strikes and improve productivity that lags about 20 percent behind the EU average. 
PAME, a communist-affiliated union, was scheduled to hold a demonstration in central Athens at midday (1000 GMT) on Friday.
""Blood was shed by generations which came before us to have the right to strike. Now a so-called left wing government is trying to abolish it,"" said Nicos Papageorgiou, a 50 year old hotel worker. 
Syriza, the dominant party in the government elected in 2015, has its roots in left-wing labor activism.
Papageorgiou and about 200 other PAME members rallied outside the finance ministry on Thursday evening. Earlier in the week, there were angry scenes when some union members burst into the labor ministry, demanding the government rescind the bill. 
ADEDY, the largest union of public-sector workers, scheduled a work stoppage for Monday.

The government says it needs the reforms to receive tranches of bailout aid. The latest bailout, worth up to 86 billion euros ($104 billion), expires in August. So far Greece has received 40.2 billion euros, and a new tranche is expected to be worth around 4.5 billion euros.

1611,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>",Japan to curb asylum seekers' right to work from Monday,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will limit asylum seekers' right to work from Monday, making changes to its refugee system that are likely to swell the numbers of those in detention centers, the justice ministry said, prompting refugee groups to flag humanitarian concerns.
The move to tighten one of the developed world's toughest refugee systems, which accepted just ten during the period from January to September last year, is a bid to clamp down on what Japan views as a system of back-door immigration.
From Monday, the right to work is to be limited only to those Japan regards as bonafide refugees, while repeat applicants and those failing initial checks will be held in detention centers after their permission to stay in Japan expires, the justice ministry said.
""We want to focus on responding appropriately to refugees that need protection,"" Justice Minister Yoko Kamikawa told a news conference on Friday, adding that the changes do not mean the government will be reluctant to accept refugees.
Asylum seekers with valid visas now receive renewable permits to work in Japan while their refugee claims are reviewed - a system the government says has spurred people to seek asylum as a means of finding jobs. 
With its shrinking population and high barriers to blue-collar immigration, Japan is grappling with the tightest labor demand in decades.
This has spawned a ""gray"" labor market, in which worker-strapped companies hire asylum seekers to make up the numbers, Reuters' investigations have found.
The number of asylum seekers in Japan has risen steadily in recent years to a record, with more than 14,000 applicants between January and September last year, an increase of almost 80 percent from the year earlier period, ministry data shows. 
About 60 percent of those asylum seekers would not qualify for work permits under the new system, said justice ministry official Tetsuya Hagioka, who oversees the refugee system.
The changes, which could lead to more detentions, will affect only those who seek asylum after Monday, Hagioka said, adding that current holders of work permits can continue working while their claims are reviewed.
Japan's immigration detention centers held 417,383 people in 2016, the latest year for which data is available. The figure includes those detained more than once during the year, however.
Activists say cracking down on asylum seekers looking for work will not resolve the issue, however.
""The abuse of the refugee system stems from the fundamental fact that Japan suffers from labor shortages and yet does not accept foreign workers,"" said Eri Ishikawa, of the Japan Association for Refugees.

""We are greatly worried about the government threatening the asylum seekers' livelihood without addressing this core issue.""

1612,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 03:10AM ET</span>",Philippine police chief says cops could soon make drugs war return,"MANILA (Reuters) - Police anti-narcotics operations notorious for their deadly outcomes could make a comeback in the Philippines' war on drugs, although bloodshed should be avoided and abuses would not be tolerated, the country's police chief said on Friday.
""Oplan Tokhang"", where police visit homes of users and dealers and seek their surrender, could resume within a few weeks and should be free of violence if suspects agree to go quietly, police chief Ronald Dela Rosa said.
His remarks are the strongest sign in months of a re-intensification of a war on drugs that has lost considerable momentum since President Rodrigo Duterte ordered police to halt operations and let the undermanned drugs enforcement agency, PDEA, run his signature campaign.
Nearly 4,000 Filipinos have been killed by police in the drugs war since June 2016. Human rights groups accuse police of carrying out illegal killings, staging crime scenes and falsifying reports, a charge they vigorously deny.
""Tokhang should actually be bloodless because the spirit of Tokhang, if implemented properly is 'knock and plead',"" Dela Rosa told reporters.
He was advocating for its return but did not state a reason. 
The ""Tokhang"" approach sees officers knock on doors of homes of suspected drug users or dealers to convince them to surrender or be rehabilitated. Another widely used approach by police is a so-called ""buy-bust"" or sting operation.
Activists say in many cases, suspects were not given a chance to give up, and were instead executed in cold blood.
Police reject that and typically say the victims were killed because they violently resisted arrest. They cite more than 117,000 drugs-related arrests as evidence of their intent to preserve life.
Dela Rosa said abuses had taken place but referred only to officers soliciting bribes to remove names of suspects from lists they had compiled.
He said an oversight committee would be set up and if resources were available, police involved in sting operations would be equipped with body cameras.
""This time around we will ensure it will be properly implemented and those who will commit abuses would be made accountable,"" he added.
Duterte announced the suspension of police anti-drugs operations on Oct. 11 last year, without specifying exactly why. He later said he hoped that would satisfy activists he called ""bleeding hearts"", and interfering western states. 
Duterte and his aides have, however, voiced concern about drugs returning to the streets due to a lack of manpower with police on the sidelines. 
At present, police are allowed to assist PDEA operations, but not lead their own. 
Radio reports of drugs-related killings in recent months have been less frequent than previously.

It is not immediately clear how many people have been killed in drugs-related incidents in the Philippines since Oct. 11. A spokesman for PDEA on Friday said the agency had no data on casualties over that period.

1613,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>",Beijing professor dismissed as sexual harassment allegations spark campus activism,"By Philip Wen and Christian Shepherd
BEIJING (Reuters) - A professor in China accused of sexually harassing students under his supervision has been removed from teaching posts by a top Beijing university, in a case that has sparked national media coverage and a nascent #MeToo movement in the country.
Beihang University said in a statement on its official Weibo account late on Thursday that an investigation found the professor, Chen Xiaowu, had engaged in ""sexual harassment behavior"" that seriously violated professional ethics and the school's code of conduct.
The Beijing Youth Daily had previously reported Chen saying he had done ""nothing illegal"", but Reuters was unable to reach him for comment as the university declined to provide Chen's telephone number and said he was refusing interviews. 
The university's investigation was launched after former Beihang student Luo Xixi publicly accused Chen of sexually harassing her 13 years ago in an online blog that promptly went viral after it was posted on Jan. 1. 
In the post, Luo said Chen made an unwanted sexual advance after luring her to his sister's house, and that he only relented after she burst into tears and said she was a virgin. Luo also accused Chen of harassing several other students.
Luo, who now lives in the United States, said she was inspired by the #MeToo social media movement that started in October in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations in the U.S. entertainment industry, and encouraged others to come forward and share their own experiences under the hashtag. 
Luo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Chen's dismissal.
Luo's allegations, combined with another public post from a Peking University graduate, have inspired students from more than 50 universities to issue open letters demanding more effective oversight and a reporting system to deal with sexual harassment on their campuses.
But unlike #MeToo in the United States, the campaign has mostly been spread by word of mouth and has struggled to gain traction on social media, in part because Chinese internet censors have been swift to take down the open letters.
Instances of campus sexual harassment have surfaced regularly in recent years, but are usually reported in China's state-run media as isolated cases rather than part of a wider systemic problem.
In its statement, Beihang said Chen was removed as vice-president of the university's graduate school and that his credentials as a teacher and post-graduate supervisor were revoked.
Zhang Leilei, a Guangzhou-based women's rights activist involved in the campaign against campus sexual harassment, said the response from Beihang was clear and swift and represented progress.
She said the campaign would continue to raise the issue's profile in the media so that people would become more ready to speak out, as they have through the #MeToo movement.
On Friday, a student from another university in Beijing came forward with accusations of sexual harassment against her professor in an online post, saying she was emboldened by Beihang's handling of Luo's complaint.
""Right now it seems we may be reaching a tipping point on this particular issue,"" Zhang told Reuters. ""We hope to use it as a window to begin making change.""

Duterte's trust rating in pollster Social Weather Station's(SWS) quarterly surveys had been ""excellent"" from the time he took power in June 2016 until June last year, before it dipped in the third quarter, raising questions about whether he might be starting to lose his almost rock-star appeal.
Although that rating was still high, the size of the fall - 18 points - was notable for a former southern mayor who is regarded by millions of working class Filipinos as the best hope for long overdue change after a succession of Manila-centric leaders who failed to deliver.
But Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the latest survey showed the public recognized that Duterte was exercising political will to address security and crime problems and ensure sustained economic growth.
""He has promoted the rule of law against the threats of terrorism and, of course, he is winning the war against drugs,"" he told reporters, referring to Duterte's signature and deadly anti-narcotics campaign.
The firebrand leader has also been enjoying majority approval and trust ratings from surveys done by another pollster, Pulse Asia, despite drawing international criticisms for his abusive public comments and a war on drugs that has killed thousands of Filipinos.
The SWS survey, conducted from December 8 to 16 using face-to-face interviews with 1,200 respondents, found 83 percent of adult Filipinos with ""much trust"" in him.
SWS said public satisfaction with Duterte's performance was also high with a score of 58 in December, improving from 48 in the previous quarter.

Officials noticed the panel was missing from the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747, one of two jetliners used by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for foreign trips, after it flew from Tokyo to its base on the northern island of Hokkaido on Thursday, a spokesman for the Japan Air Self Defence Force (ASDF) said.
The part, measuring 38 cm (15 inches) by 20 cm, has not been found. It is an access panel near the pylon connecting one of the engines to the right wing.
""There was no sign of it on the runways so it's going to be very difficult to locate,"" the spokesman said.
A recent string of incidents involving U.S. aircraft based on Japan's southern island of Okinawa prompted Japan's Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera on Tuesday to ask his U.S. counterpart James Mattis to implement measures that would prevent any recurrences.
Those incidents, which included a window falling from a helicopter onto a school playground last month, have fueled public opposition to the U.S. presence on the strategically located island at the edge of the East China Sea. 
The air force would conduct an investigation to determine why the panel had fallen off Abe's plane, the ASDF spokesman said.
The two government jumbos left Tokyo on Friday carrying Abe, government officials and Japanese business representatives on a six-day trip to Eastern Europe, including stops in Estonia, Lithuania, Serbia and Romania.
Abe did not board the 747 that lost the panel.
Japan has ordered two Boeing 777 planes to replace the aging jumbos after March 2019. It also plans to switch to ANA Holdings for maintenance work from rival Japan Airlines Co..

The Mexican office of the U.N. High Commission for Human Rights said it obtained documentation of torture, fabricated evidence, poor detention conditions and searches conducted without warrants after the shootout on Sunday.
""The U.N. has strong convictions about the existence of human rights violations committed by security forces during the operation, which are profoundly troubling,"" the office said in a statement. 
Officers arrested at least 30 people after the shootout south of Acapulco in the state of Guerrero, in which residents clashed with a self-appointed community police force.
Jan Jarab, representative for the U.N. rights commission in Mexico, called for the investigation of all deaths, including those that occurred during police proceedings. 
He also described the aggression against journalist Bernardino Hernandez, who had to be hospitalized, as ""particularly grave."" 
The United Nations did not specify whether the police or army may have committed abuses, but reports at the time said local police were involved in the operation. 
Mexico's security forces, particularly its military, have been embroiled in multiple human rights scandals in recent decades, including extrajudicial killings of gang members and the 2014 disappearance of 43 students near a military base in Guerrero.
For years, Guerrero has experienced a wave of crimes and disappearances linked to the bloody battles waged by drug gangs for control of the territory.

SAN CRISTOBAL/BARINAS, Venezuela (Reuters) - Hungry mobs ransacked a food collection center, and a supermarket in Venezuela's western Andean state of Merida on Thursday and reportedly even slaughtered cattle grazing in a field as unrest over food shortages spread through the country.
An opposition lawmaker from Merida, Carlos Paparoni, said four people had died and 10 were injured in the chaos over the last two days, but he did not specify the circumstances.
Four years of recession and the world’s highest inflation have plunged millions of Venezuelans into poverty, and President Nicolas Maduro's authoritarian socialist regime faces mounting unrest.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to a request for information about the latest disturbances to rock the nation of 30 million people. Looters plundered a truck carrying corn, a food collection center, and a state-run supermarket, according to Paparoni, and a vet who witnessed the mayhem.
A video on social media also showed around a dozen men running into a lush pasture, chasing a cow, and then apparently beating it to death.
""They're hunting. The people are hungry!"" says the narrator of the video, who filmed the incident from his car. Lawmaker Paparoni said some 300 animals were believed to have been killed. Reuters could not verify the information.
Zuley Urdaneta, a 50 year-old vet in Merida, witnessed the looting of a truck along the highway around 2 p.m. on Thursday afternoon. About two hours later, he said some 800 people converged on a food collection center and proceeded to plunder it.
""They knocked down the gates and looted flour, rice, cooking oil, cooking gas,"" said Urdaneta. ""The police and the National Guard tried to control the situation by giving out what was left.""
Looting has been increasing in the provinces since Christmas, with food shortages and hyperinflation leaving millions of people hungry, though the capital, Caracas, has so far been largely unaffected.
The opposition says Maduro's failed economic policies and rampant corruption are to blame for the meltdown in the once booming country home to the world's largest crude reserves.
""What we're living is barbaric,"" said opposition lawmaker Juan Guaido in a tweet referencing the slaughter the cattle. ""The dehumanizing regime of Nicolas Maduro is turning a blind eye to the tragedy that we Venezuelans are living.""
Maduro's government accuses political opponents and business-friendly foreign powers of trying to foment a social uprising against him by stoking inflation and hoarding food.
In what they said was an attempt to combat “speculation,” authorities last week forced over 200 supermarkets to slash prices, creating chaos as desperate Venezuelans leapt at the chance to buy cheaper food.
Some supermarkets were sold out of fruit and vegetables, and staff were unsure if the shelves would be replenished.

Japan and South Korea share a bitter history that includes Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the peninsula and the ""comfort women"" issue is especially touchy. The U.S. allies are key to efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
South Korea said this week that the 2015 agreement, struck by President Moon Jae-in's conservative predecessor, had failed to meet the victims' needs and resolve the feud. 
The 2015 agreement was ""a promise between the two nations. Keeping this promise is an international and universal principle. We cannot accept South Korea's unilateral demands for additional measures,"" Abe told reporters. 
""We have been sincere in executing every promise we made. We want to continue to strongly ask South Korea to do the same.""
Seoul is not seeking to renegotiate the agreement, which the two sides had said would ""finally and irreversibly"" end the feud if both sides stuck to it. Under the deal, Japan apologized again and promised 1 billion yen ($8.99 million) for a fund to help the women.
But South Korea has urged Tokyo to take added steps, including a fresh apology.
Japanese media reports have said Abe may not attend the Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea next month because of the feud, although the government's top spokesman said on Thursday that it had not been decided.

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (Reuters) - Rescuers picking through waist-deep mud on Thursday, two days after a massive mudslide killed at least 17 people along Southern California's coast, said they feared more bodies may be found but still held out hope for ""miracle"" survivors.
The walls of fast-moving mud and debris that tore through hillside communities before dawn on Tuesday took the lives of three children, at least one married couple and two people in their 80s, officials said in releasing the names of the dead.
Authorities hiked the number of those considered missing to 43 at an afternoon press conference, up from eight earlier in the day, saying that some of those people may be out of town or in a hospital but that others may be deceased.
""Realistically we suspect we are going to have the discovery of more people killed in this incident,"" Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.
Asked by reporters if the operation had shifted from a rescue to a recovery more than 48 hours after the mud came down, the sheriff said his crews had not given up hope.
""There have been many miraculous stories of people lasting many days (following similar disasters) and certainly we are searching for a miracle right now,"" Brown said.
About 700 rescue workers in helicopters and high-wheeled military vehicles, some with search dogs, were deployed in the hunt for the missing in a disaster zone littered with the remnants of hundreds of damaged or destroyed homes.
Among the dead were an elderly woman whose house was washed away by mud, the founder of a Roman Catholic school and a real estate executive, according to friends, family and local news media.
The cause of death for all 17 will be listed as multiple traumatic injuries due to flash flood with mudslides, the Santa Barbara Sheriff's office said in a statement.
""The Sheriff's Office wants to express our heartfelt sadness to the family and friends of those who lost their loved ones,"" it said.
SWEPT AWAY
Two of the victims were killed when their houses were swept away in the mudslides.
Josephine Gower, 69, died when she opened the door to her home, her son, Hayden Gower, told NBC station KSBY. Her daughter-in-law Sarah Gower confirmed Gower's death in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. Her body was found that night, near a highway hit by the slide.
""I told her to stay on the second floor, but she went downstairs and opened the door and just got swept away,"" Hayden Gower told KSBY. ""I should have just told her to leave. You just don't even think that this is possible."" 
Roy Rohter, 84-year-old founder of the St. Augustine Academy Roman Catholic school in Ventura, died when the slide swept him from his home in Montecito, according to school officials and local news media.
Rebecca Riskin, the 61-year-old founder of a real estate firm, was also killed in Montecito, according to the company and local news media. 
""She was in the house and was swept away,"" said Renee Grub, a friend of Riskin. ""I'm told there was about 5 feet (1.5 m) of mud. She was a dear friend. She's so little she was only like 100 pounds (45.36 kg).""
Heavy rains on hillsides denuded by last year's record wildfires triggered the mudslides, which also destroyed about 100 homes and injured at least 28 people, officials said.
The region's natural beauty and easy access to Los Angeles to the southeast have long attracted the rich and powerful, including television personality Oprah Winfrey, former tennis star Jimmy Connors, talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres and actor Jeff Bridges.
""Our home has been severely damaged, but we are safe, and so thankful for that and for the first responders who are working tirelessly to save people,"" Bridges wrote on Twitter. ""We are heartbroken over the loss of lives in our community.""

Last month's spate of wildfires, including the largest in California history, burned away grass and shrubs that held soil in place, and baked a waxy layer into the earth that prevents water from sinking deeply into the ground.

Lawyer Tomas Lucena, 31, was in his pickup truck with relatives on Wednesday afternoon when he was shot several times. He died in a hospital in Trujillo state, the public prosecutor's office said in a statement. 
A relative unknown in Venezuelan politics, Lucena was a member of the 545-strong 'Constituent Assembly' created last year by socialist President Nicolas Maduro in a move widely condemned by Western powers and fellow Latin American nations.
Speaking during an hours-long televised broadcast, Maduro alleged that Lucena, a father of three young children, had been targeted for political reasons. 
""(He was) killed by right-wing hit men,"" Maduro said. 
""Violence here, violence there... directed by the embassy of the United States,"" he added, without offering any evidence.

Critics say Maduro routinely uses Washington as a scapegoat for the OPEC member's political and economic meltdown.

Trump has derided the North Korean leader as a ""maniac"" and referred to him as ""little rocket man."" Kim has responded by calling the U.S. president a ""mentally deranged U.S. dotard.""
""I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un,"" Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. ""I have relationships with people. I think you people are surprised.""
Kim has warned the United States that he intends to build a nuclear arsenal capable of hitting the United States, prompting threats of military action by Washington.
Asked whether he has spoken with the North Korean leader, Trump told the newspaper: ""I don't want to comment on it. I'm not saying I have or haven't. I just don't want to comment.""
In November, Trump said while on a trip to Vietnam that becoming friends with Kim ""might be a strange thing to happen but it's a possibility.""
Kim, in a speech last week, said the ""nuclear button is always on my desk,"" prompting Trump to respond in a tweet that his nuclear button is ""a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!""
In the Journal interview, Trump suggested his combative tweets are part of a broader strategy. 
""You’ll see that a lot with me,"" he said, ""and then all of the sudden somebody’s my best friend. I could give you 20 examples. You could give me 30. I’m a very flexible person.""
Trump told the newspaper a decision by the United States and South Korea to postpone military exercises until after next month's Winter Olympics in South Korea ""sends a good message to North Korea.""

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 04:51PM ET</span>",Trump Iran decision due as allies plea for nuclear deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump was expected to decide on Thursday whether to extend sanctions relief to Iran under the 2015 nuclear deal as major European allies implored Washington to preserve the landmark arms control pact.
Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told reporters he expected Trump to decide on whether to continue sanctions relief for Iran on Thursday but was not sure if the decision would be announced Thursday night or Friday.
A move to reimpose sanctions would effectively torpedo the agreement reached between Iran and five major powers under which Tehran pledged to rein in its nuclear program in return for some easing of the economic restrictions imposed on it by the United States, the United Nations and the European Union.
In a telephone call with Trump on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron stressed the importance of abiding by the nuclear deal and, in an apparent effort to win the U.S. president over, emphasized the need to enforce it rigorously.
""The proper implementation of the agreement should be accompanied by a strengthened dialogue with Iran on its ballistic program and its regional policy, in order to guarantee better stability in the Middle East,"" the French presidency said in a statement on the call.
Two senior U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday that Trump's top advisers were recommending that he not reimpose sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the nuclear agreement.
However, Trump, who has previously vowed to scrap the nuclear pact, was privately expressing reluctance to heed the advisers, the officials said.
In one possible compromise, Trump could choose not to reimpose the sanctions that were eased under the nuclear deal but could slap other punishments on Iran, a pattern he has followed over the last year.
One U.S. official said on Wednesday that if Trump waived the key sanctions under the deal, the administration would impose new, targeted measures against Iranian businesses and people.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Thursday that he expected Trump to impose new sanctions on Iran, without addressing what he would decide on the nuclear deal's sanctions.

""I am expecting new sanctions on Iran,"" Mnuchin told reporters. ""We continue to look at them. We've rolled them out and I think you can expect there will be more sanctions coming.""

1626,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Turkish parliament strips pro-Kurdish lawmaker of her status,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish parliament on Thursday stripped a pro-Kurdish lawmaker of her status for a second time, this time due to her absence from its sessions, parliamentary sources said.
Leyla Zana had spoken Kurdish while being sworn into parliament in November 2015, leading the speaker to rule her oath invalid. Following that, she did not attend 212 parliament meetings between Oct. 1, 2016 and April 30, 2017.
""With the hope of an honorable and lasting peace"" Zana had said in Kurdish while taking the oath. She had also finished it by changing its official wording of ""Turkish people"" to ""people of Turkey.""
Speaking Kurdish was banned in Turkey after the 1980 military coup until 1991, and some other restrictions have since been eased. Members of Zana's People's Democratic Party (HDP) party say there is no law stating that Kurdish cannot be used in an oath. 
A majority vote in the parliament on Thursday ruled in favor of ejecting Zana from legislature due to her continued absence. 
She had won a seat in the November 2015 snap elections, which were held in the wake of renewed conflict between the Turkish state and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants, following the collapse of a ceasefire.
""Leyla Zana being stripped of her lawmaker status is void before our people,"" the HDP said in a tweet following the decision. ""Leyla Zana is the sound of peace, the will of the people, our member of parliament.""
In June 2015, the HDP had also won seats in parliament as a party for the first time, depriving the ruling AK Party of a majority. Zana then took her oath in Turkish.
Zana rose to prominence in 1991, causing uproar in Turkey's parliament by speaking in Kurdish at her oath-swearing ceremony.
The speech prompted parliament to strip her of her immunity and eject her from the legislature. It was used as evidence against her when she and three other MPs, elected as independents, were jailed in 1994 for links to the PKK. They were freed in 2004.

Turkey has since broadened human rights and boosted Kurdish linguistic and political freedoms.

SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria's government won endorsement from the EU executive on Thursday for its demands to be let in to Europe's more exclusive clubs despite critics at home and abroad who question Sofia's record on tackling corruption.
Eleven years after joining the European Union, the bloc's poorest nation grasped its first taste of holding the rotating presidency of EU ministerial councils to stage a show of loyalty for visiting Brussels dignitaries and ram home its demands to join the euro currency area and Schengen free-travel zone.
Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, a former bodyguard to the Soviet-era Communist dictator, welcomed fellow conservatives who run the three main Brussels political institutions to Sofia, pledging to help ease tensions between east and west inside the EU and between the Union and its Russian and Turkish neighbors.
Though the presidency of the EU offers little direct power, it offers Borissov a platform which he used to renew Bulgarian demands to be allowed to join Schengen and the euro's ""waiting room"", the ERM-2 exchange rate mechanism. Worries over organized crime and Bulgaria's relative poverty have stood in its way.
The premier played down problems with crime - despite the assassination of a wealthy businessman in broad daylight in Sofia this week - and insisted historic ties with Russia were an asset to the EU that in no way detracted from his country's loyalty to the Western alliance.
It was not ""fair"", therefore, that Bulgaria was denied entry to Schengen, despite defending the EU's external border with Turkey, and to the euro zone, despite meeting all the economic criteria and having fixed its currency to the euro for 20 years.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU chief executive, has thrown his weight behind those demands and repeated that position in Sofia on Thursday evening: 
""Your place is in Europe and your place is in Schengen and your place is in the euro,"" Juncker told him. ""We will work for that. The Commission will be by Bulgaria's side.""
PROTESTS
That will not in itself overcome resistance from wary member states. Borissov's finance minister said frustration had grown to such an extent that he was ready to call their bluff and apply for the next step toward the euro zone in order to force them to publicly explain their objections.
Donald Tusk, the former Polish premier who chairs summits of EU leaders, spoke favorably of Bulgaria's ambitions and, in a speech in fluent Bulgarian that delighted his audience, welcomed Sofia's push to use the coming six months to re-engage the EU with would-be members in the troubled western Balkans.
Warm words from the visitors from Brussels did not drown out opposition at home to the government. Borissov dismissed out of hand accusations of shrinking media freedom and his minister in charge of the EU presidency denounced a website run by critical journalists covering the issue as ""hate speech"" and ""fake news"".

Hundreds of people waving banners including ""Citizens against the mafia"" demonstrated in central Sofia to protest at government approval of new ski facilities in the mountains which they argue shows the authorities favoring commercial interests over environmental protection laws.

Brigadier-General Tareq Mohammed Saleh, who led a brigade of an elite Yemeni army unit before his uncle was forced to step down in 2012, had been expected to help lead Saleh's supporters in a fresh fight against the Iran-aligned Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.
Addressing supporters in the southern Shabwa province where he had traveled to offer condolences to the family of Aref al-Zouka, who was killed along with Saleh in the attack on Saleh's residence in Sanaa, Tareq said he remained committed to his uncle's quest for peace in Yemen.
""We are with what the leader had willed, especially his demand to stop the war, lifting the siege from our people,"" said Tareq, who survived the attack by Houthi forces.
""We also extend our hands to our brothers, particularly the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to work to end the war and to restore stability and security to Yemen,"" he added.
Initial reports said Tareq was killed in the fighting that erupted after Saleh called on the Saudi-led coalition to end the war, a move interpreted by the Houthis as a betrayal.
But it later emerged that he had survived and had made his way to a safe location.
Zouka was the secretary-general of Saleh's General People's Congress party.
The Saudi-led coalition intervened in the Yemen war in March 2015 to try to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power after the Houthis, backed by Saleh's supporters, forced him into exile.
The Yemen war has killed more than 10,000 people and ruined the economy and pushed the country to the verge of famine.

There is widespread belief among civil society groups in Ghana that corruption is on the rise, especially among public office holders.
The appointment of Martin Amidu, who briefly served as attorney-general under former president John Mills, was in fulfillment of a campaign promise by Akufo-Addo ahead of elections in December 2016.
Ghana's parliament passed a law in November establishing the office of an independent anti-graft prosecutor to fight corruption and recover looted resources.
Ghana's courts are currently probing a 52 million cedi payment on a government contract that state prosecutors said was unjustified, while parliament on Monday began a hearing on reports the trade ministry charged foreign investors between $25,000 and $100,000 to enable them to sit close to the president at a recent dinner.
Both the trade ministry and the other accused have denied any wrongdoing. 
Akufo-Addo said Amidu, who has won accolades for successfully pursuing cases of corruption in court, merited the position.
""(He) has the requisite integrity, competence, courage and independence of character to discharge effectively the responsibilities of this new office,"" he said. The appointment requires approval by parliament.
Amidu was appointed by Mills as Minister of Justice in January 2012 but was fired only days after his appointment under unclear circumstances.
He has since been a critic of the government at the time, now the main opposition party, accusing some of its officials of corruption.

He had served as deputy attorney general in the last four years of Ghana's military government under longtime ruler Jerry Rawlings.

Christian Ganczarski, a German convert to Islam who spent time in Afghanistan and is believed to have been an adviser to former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, was arrested in France in 2003.
He was sentenced in 2009 to 18 years in prison for being one of the masterminds behind the attack in Djerba that killed 21 people.
The victims were killed when the bomber drove a tanker truck filled with cooking gas to the synagogue and blew it up as they were entering the building, which was virtually destroyed. A synagogue had stood on the site for 1,900 years.
Ganczarski's sentence was due to end in February. The United States had indicated it wanted him extradited for his role in the September 11 attacks.
Officials said that he attacked four guards with a bladed weapon on Thursday.
""The head of the establishment told him that he would be extradited to the United States where he is suspected of being one of the organizers of the Sept. 11 attacks,"" Jean-Francois Forget, secretary general of the UFAP-UNSA penitentiary union, told Reuters.
""He was recorded in a telephone call saying he would do something to stay in France.""
A second union official, Yoan Karar, said that Ganczarski had been put in isolation ahead of his extradition.
Prosecutors opened a counter-terrorism investigation into Thursday's attack, which will inevitably delay any possible extradition.
Ganczarski was one of three men, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, one of the principal figures linked to the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, who were originally tried in Paris for the Djerba attacks.
According to court documents at the time, Sheikh Mohammed and Ganczarski received telephone calls from the suicide bomber before the attack.
German police also recorded a conversation in which the bomber asked Ganczarski for his blessing together with the reply ""May God reward you"".
The Polish-born Ganczarski, described by investigators as a computer and communications technology specialist, converted to Islam in 1986 and spent time in both Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan.
A witness quoted in court documents said he ""swore allegiance"" to bin Laden in 1998 and became one of al Qaeda’s specialists in radio, Internet and communication.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Macron sings praises of Italian prime minister ahead of election,"ROME (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron heaped praise on Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni in Rome on Thursday, less than two months before national elections in Italy that opinion polls say the ruling center-left government will lose.
Macron told reporters at the end of a two-day visit to Rome that he had no intention of interfering in the Italian ballot, which is set for March 4. But his comments left little doubt over where his sympathies lay.
""It is up to Italians to decide how to vote, but let me say that Europe has been very lucky to have Gentiloni and I hope we can continue the work that we have started,"" he told a news conference, standing alongside the Italian leader.
Gentiloni's Democratic Party (PD) is trailing in the opinion polls to both the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and a center-right bloc that includes the far-right Northern League party and the nationalist Brothers of Italy.
All the main opposition parties are seen as hostile to Brussels to various degrees and all are seeking significant changes to EU budget rules. The League is also pushing for Italy to quit the euro currency, although its partners reject this.
Macron took power in France in May promoting a fiercely pro-EU agenda. On Thursday he again stressed the importance of a united and purposeful Europe.
""Can I say that the European Union is positive for Italy, and can I also say that an Italy which believes in Europe is positive for Europe,"" Macron said.
The ruling PD, which is led by former prime minister Matteo Renzi, has often clashed with Brussels over budget rigors, but at the same time, it has championed ever-closer integration.
Looking to strengthen Franco-Italian ties, Macron and Gentiloni unveiled a new treaty on Thursday which they said would provide a strong framework for relations between the second- and third-largest economies in the euro zone.

""We have always worked together in an extraordinary way, but we are convinced that this will make our relations even stronger and more systematic,"" Gentiloni said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - On a state visit to China this week, French President Emmanuel Macron got plaudits for giving his host a horse -- but also experienced the limits faced by Western leaders in dealing with the new superpower on the block.
Macron was in Beijing to reset trade relations and address European fears that China's trillion dollar modern day Silk Route will be a one way road for Chinese commodities and goods.
Discussions about China's human rights record? Not so much. 
China frequently says it does not believe the issue of human rights should be politicized. President Xi Jinping's administration has tightened control over civil society, citing a need for more security and stability and activists say a sweeping crackdown on dissent has left dozens jailed.
Macron, despite pressure from campaign groups, decided not to be drawn into what he called ""loud speaker diplomacy"" and cautioned against the dangers of telling others how to behave.
He was not totally silent, however, touring a contemporary art gallery in central Beijing, a late addition to itinerary and resisted, according to his entourage, by Chinese officials.
Asked if the gallery visit was a subtle nod to those artists whose freedom of expression is curbed in China, Macron only said:
""Coming here to see these artists is also a way to witness contemporary Chinese expression and sensibility expressing itself freely, openly, without ignoring what exists elsewhere."" 
Like others from the West, the French president knows the limits of what one can do and say on a China visit.
So, on to France's clout as a business partner with Beijing.
There were no eye-catching trade deals, and China appeared only mildly interested in French industrial might.
Macron toured a Beijing aerospace facility where China and France are co-developing an observation satellite that will help measure climate change.
It was billed as the centre-piece of the final day for a leader whose country prides itself on its world-leading industries, including aerospace. 
But no sooner had Macron passed through a decontamination airlock and stepped into a giant hall, he was reminded of China's exploration ambitions, receiving an extensive overview of Beijing's plans to explore the Moon and Mars.
""Is there any embedded technology from (French engineering firm) Thales in there?"" Macron asked his hosts as he peered over an intricate diagram.
A blunt answer came back: No. This was 100 percent Chinese technology.
Finally, he was shown the Franco-Chinese satellite dubbed CFOSat before passing by a simulator for China’s future manned space station, a smaller sister of the International Space Station.
France will provide all the medical instruments for the Chinese space station program, the head of the French space agency, Jean-Yves Le Gall, told the president. 

""It allows us to keep a foot in the door,"" he whispered in Macron's ear.

1638,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Iranian cleric leaves Germany under threat of prosecution,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A senior Iranian cleric under investigation in Germany for alleged crimes against humanity left the country on a homeward-bound flight on Thursday, cutting short his stay at a Hanover clinic, a German official said.
Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, a former chief justice, was in Germany for treatment at the clinic of Iranian-German neurosurgeon Majid Samii when activists referred him to prosecutors, citing what they called his record of passing death sentences.
The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an exiled opposition group, said his issuing of ""thousands"" of death sentences amounted to a crime against humanity and urged German prosecutors to investigate.
Prosecutors said they were investigating the referrals, including one from senior Green politician Volker Beck. Later, the NCRI reported that Iran had reserved tickets for Shahroudi and his entourage to leave the country.
A German government official told Reuters on Thursday afternoon that Shahroudi was aboard an Iran-bound plane.
While Germany, like all European Union countries, opposes the death penalty, German prosecutors do not automatically act on cases referred to them involving executions in foreign countries. 
For the issuing of death sentences to amount to a crime against humanity, they would have to be part of a systematic attack on a civilian population.
An NCRI activist condemned Shahroudi's departure. ""He should have been prosecuted for thousands of executions in Iran,"" said Shahin Gobadi, a member of the NCRI's foreign affairs committee.
NCRI spokesman Javad Dabiran said the group had seen Shahroudi leave the Hanover hospital in a convoy before departing from Hamburg airport on an Iran Air flight at 1325 local time (1225 GMT).
It said it had filed a formal complaint with prosecutors, accusing Shahroudi of committing crimes against humanity and urging Berlin to prevent the cleric from leaving Germany. 
An arrest warrant would have to be issued by Germany's constitutional court.
Shahroudi was head of Iran's judiciary for a decade and is currently the head of the Expediency Council, a body intended to resolve disputes between parliament and a hardline watchdog body, the Guardian Council.
Reuters could not immediately reach Shahroudi for comment. 
Shahroudi's visit to a hospital in Germany prompted anger among some Iranians who believe officials in the Islamic Republic should use the same health system as ordinary Iranians.
Parviz Davoudi, an official in his office, said on Monday that ""Shahroudi was against traveling to Germany, and only did so after doctors insisted there is a medical emergency"".

Russia's central election commission last month barred Navalny from taking part in a March presidential election, ruling he was ineligible due to a suspended prison sentence on charges he says were trumped up.
The United States and the European Union criticized the decision, while Navalny said he would encourage people to boycott the vote and would organize a protest rally.
Putin, who is running for a fourth presidential term which polls show he should comfortably win, described U.S. criticism of the central election's commission's decision as crude interference in Russia's internal affairs.
""The person you mentioned (Navalny) is not the only one who hasn't been allowed to run (in the election), but for some reason they are not talking about the other people,"" Putin told Russian newspaper editors in a meeting broadcast on state TV. 

""That obviously shows the U.S. administration's preferences when it comes to who they want to lead other countries, who they want to move forward in Russian politics, and who they'd like to see in the country's leadership.""

1641,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 12:14PM ET</span>",Argentine faithful flock to Chile as Pope avoids homecoming,"By Caroline Stauffer and Antonio De la Jara
BUENOS AIRES/SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Argentines will cross into Chile next week to see Buenos Aires-born Pope Francis, who has yet to return home despite visiting much of Latin America since his election nearly five years ago.
Some 40,000 young Argentines are heading to one of three Chilean cities the pope is to visit, said Mariano Garcia, 36, Argentina's national coordinator of youth ministry. 
""The visit is very important for all the youth of Argentina,"" Garcia said. ""(Francis) is one of the great leaders, not just for young people inside the Catholic Church but for all young people.""
The first Latin American pope made his inaugural overseas trip as pontiff to Brazil four months after his election on March, 13, 2013. He has since visited Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Mexico, Cuba and Colombia, and travels to Peru after Chile. 
But - possibly wary about getting embroiled in Argentina's often volatile politics - he is yet to schedule a visit to his home country, which is Latin America's third-largest economy and fourth-largest country by population.
Asked on Thursday why the pope had not yet visited Argentina, Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said only that the pope will fly over Argentina on his way to Chile and will send a customary message from his plane to the head of state. ""It should be an interesting telegram,"" Burke said. 
The pope, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, has met with Argentina's President Mauricio Macri at the Vatican. But as a sharp critic of global capitalism, some question the pope's affinity for Macri, a scion of one of Argentina's wealthiest families.
Francis is clearly disapproving of governments that do not tackle exclusion and have ""conservative economic views,"" said Daniel Menendez, coordinator of Buenos Aires-based community organizing group Barrios de Pie and one of around 500 activists planning to travel to the Patagonian city of Temuco, just over 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Argentina.
Macri has said he hopes his presidency will be judged on his government's ability to lower Argentina's poverty rate.
The pope is no ally of much of the opposition either. As archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio had a rocky relationship with Argentina's leftist former president, Cristina Fernandez, now a senator, as well as her late husband and predecessor Nestor Kirchner.
Kirchner avoided Bergoglio by shunning a traditional Mass in Buenos Aires cathedral to mark an important national anniversary and often directed harsh words toward the clergy.
While she later sought to portray herself as close to the pope, Fernandez's relationship with the then archbishop soured when the Church praised a chaotic uprising by farmers in 2008 and again when Congress passed a law in 2010 making Argentina the first Latin American country to approve gay marriage.
During Argentina's 1976-1983 military dictatorship, when as many as 30,000 people were killed by the state in a crackdown on left-wing opponents, the Church's reputation was tarnished by evidence that some high-ranking clergy had supported the military. 
    Although that did not apply to Francis, two priests kidnapped by the military have accused him of not doing enough to protect them when he was leader of the Jesuits in Argentina, a position he held from 1973 to 1979. 
    The Vatican has denied the claims, saying Bergoglio worked behind the scenes to free them. 
""He is fully aware what an official visit to Argentina would mean and the expectations he would be awakening ... beyond the political use that could be given to his visit,"" said Guillermo Holzmann, a political analyst in Santiago. 
'NOT JUST ARGENTINA'
Menendez said he hoped Francis would address some issues relevant to Argentina in Temuco, a city at the heart of territory claimed by the indigenous Mapuche, who have clashed with authorities in both Chile and Argentina.
""We have seen the pope intervene in important conflicts like the Cuba embargo and the Colombia peace process,"" he said. ""We believe it is important to make a call for peace and dialogue."" 
Anticipating heavy traffic on curvy mountain roads, Argentina will keep border crossings open for longer and increase staffing.
The province of Mendoza, site of one of the busiest crossings into Chile, said up to 800,000 Argentines could make the trip, though a foreign ministry spokeswoman said the number would be much lower. 
Many Argentines hold out hope the pope will soon return. In the meantime, they will settle for seeing him in the southern cone.

""We are anxious for the moment we get the good news of Francis' return to Argentina,"" said Garcia. ""But the important thing is to accompany him. Francis belongs to the world now, not just Argentina.""

Apart from the three killed, three others were also wounded in fighting in the past 24 hours, Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksander Motuzyanyk said.
A Russia-backed insurgency erupted in Ukraine's industrialized east in 2014 and the bloodshed has continued despite a ceasefire deal brokered by Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine.
More than 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict, with casualties reported on a near-daily basis.
The separatist side ""more and more cynically and brazenly is increasing both the intensity and density of its firing,"" Motuzyanyk said in a televised briefing.
He said one of the servicemen was killed in separatist shelling near the government-controlled village of Novoluhanske.
In the early hours of Thursday, a Reuters witness in Novoluhanske saw Ukrainian troops firing artillery towards rebel positions in an apparent response to the attack.
""It's clear we can't stand such things from the enemy,"" an artillery commander in a pro-Ukrainian militia group called Donbas Battalion told Reuters, calling himself by his nom de guerre Hayduk.
The rebel leadership meanwhile accused Ukraine of using artillery to attack the separatists for the first time since the New Year, separatist news website DAN reported.
Under the 2015 Minsk peace agreement, all heavy weapons were meant to have been withdrawn, but ceasefire monitors regularly report violations of this and other terms of the deal on both sides of the front line.
In an effort to end the deadlock, the international community, including the United States, has called for the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers in the Donbass region.
Both Kiev and Moscow back the idea but disagree on whether the troops should be positioned on the rebel-controlled part of the Ukraine-Russia border, and no decision has been made.

Russia denies accusations from Ukraine and NATO that it supports the rebels with troops and weapons.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Protests broke out across Pakistan on Thursday after the rape and murder of a 7-year-old girl in a district south of Lahore, due to public anger at what is seen as the authorities' failure to investigate such cases.
It is the 12th such murder in the town of Kasur in a year, and has raised concern that a serial killer may be on the loose.
Two people were killed on Wednesday when police fired at angry protesters in Kasur, and a local resident said schools, offices, and markets remained shut in the town on Thursday.
Demonstrations were held in all cities between Faisalabad in the northeast down to Pakistan's southern metropolis of Karachi.
In Lahore, the provincial capital of the state where Kasur is located, protesters blocked a major road connecting the two, causing traffic between them to be suspended.
Police recovered the body of Zainab Ansari from a garbage dumpster in Kasur on Tuesday, four days after she was reported missing.
The chief minister of Punjab province, Shahbaz Sharif visited Ansari's parents to assure them that the perpetrators would be apprehended soon, a provincial government spokesman said.
""(Sharif) has announced Rs 10 million ($90,000) for anyone giving information about the kidnapper,"" Punjab government spokesman Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan told Reuters. He said it could not be ruled out that the murders involved a serial killer. 
A police official speaking on condition on anonymity said two of Ansari's relatives had been interrogated and 26 locals are currently in custody and being questioned. He added that police are waiting for forensic evidence to be collected and analyzed. 
Ansari's family doubts justice will be done.
""We don't have any expectations from police, as we gave proof to police including the CCTV footage, but they could do nothing,"" her uncle Hafiz Muhammad Adnan told Reuters.
Adnan said the kidnapper waited to dump the body after search parties took a break after four days of looking.
""It appears as if the kidnapper is a local who developed familiarity with Zainab to take her along, probably telling her that he would take her to her parents,"" he said.
A number of police officials have been transferred out of the region for failing to investigate complaints of missing children since 2015, when authorities uncovered what they said was a pedophile ring linked to a prominent local family.
At least two people have been convicted in connection with that case, in which authorities say hundreds of children in the district were abused.

Police in the republic on Tuesday detained Oyub Titiev, who runs the office of the Memorial Human Rights Centre in Chechnya, saying they had found cannabis in his car after stopping him to check his documents.
Titiev, who says the drugs were planted, faces a jail term of up to 10 years if found guilty.

Three hooded thieves carried out the robbery late on Wednesday at the ultra-chic hotel on the city center's Place Vendome, next to the Justice Ministry.
But the three, all aged about 30, were arrested after being blocked in the building, a source close to the investigation said.
Two accomplices waiting outside were thrown some booty and escaped by car and motorbike. The source said that the motorcyclist however dropped one satchel of loot after hitting a pedestrian in a melee fleeing the scene.
The getaway car was found about 20 kms (12 miles) north of Paris in an area where the three arrested came from, the source said.
Officials were still determining the value of the haul since some jewels and watches had been recovered on those arrested.
A figure of 4.5 million euros ($5.42 million), announced earlier, related to the total value of the jewelry in the display cases.
""It's possible that the total amount stolen is a lot less,"" the source said.
The hotel, owned by Egyptian billionaire Mohammed al-Fayed, first opened in 1898 and was the first Paris hotel to boast electricity on all floors and bathrooms that were inside rooms.
It was at the Ritz that Diana, Princess of Wales, spent her last night in 1997 before the car crash that killed her and her lover Dodi Fayed, al-Fayed's son.
The former home of fashion designer Coco Chanel and author Marcel Proust, the Ritz was a favorite drinking hole of American writer Ernest Hemingway.
Armed heists targeting jewelry stores are not uncommon in the area where dozens of luxury boutiques align the streets. Over the last few years police have kept a permanent presence in the area, but that has not deterred potential robbers.
In December, a man was able to substitute two diamonds and two rings worth 5.5 million euros in a jewelry store replacing them with fakes.

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 11:26AM ET</span>",Brexiteers back second EU referendum to stop 'soft' departure from bloc,"By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Two of Britain's most prominent Brexit campaigners endorsed a second referendum on leaving the European Union on Thursday as the best way to stop EU supporters from trying to water down, or even halt, the country's departure from the bloc. 
Britons shocked the political establishment in June 2016 by voting 52 to 48 percent in favor of ending more than four decades of political, economic and legal ties with the EU.
But, with the nation still deeply polarized, disillusion over the complexity of withdrawal setting in and pessimism about the economic impact of Brexit rising, many in the fervently anti-EU camp fear an eventual ""soft"" withdrawal that would keep key ties and foil any clampdown on immigration.
Nigel Farage, a central figure in the ""Leave"" campaign ahead of the referendum and in its surprise outcome, said he was warming to the idea of holding a second vote to settle the argument on whether leaving was the right decision or not. 
""Maybe, just maybe, I'm reaching the point of thinking that we should have a second referendum ... on EU membership,"" the former leader of the small UK Independence Party told Channel Five's ""The Wright Stuff"" show.
""I think if we had a second referendum on EU membership we'd kill it off for a generation. The percentage that would vote to leave next time would be very much bigger than it was last time round.""
Opinion polls show little sign of a change of heart among voters. A poll in December showed 51 percent would now keep EU membership and 41 percent wanting out. But pollster BMG said that shift was largely among those who did not vote - notably many young people - in 2016; around nine in 10 ""Leave"" and ""Remain"" voters hold fast to their views.
Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May has promised Britain will leave the EU in March 2019 and then enter a roughly two-year transition period for the government to implement new policies on issues such as trade, customs and immigration. 
Asked about Farage's comments, May's spokesman said: ""We will not be having a second referendum.""
Following Farage's comments, tycoon Arron Banks, co-founder of the Leave.EU campaign that is credited with mobilizing grassroots support for Brexit, also endorsed the idea of a second vote. He said May's government was failing to deliver the kind of divorce that Britons voted for.
""If we do not act radically now, we will sleepwalk into a faux Brexit, in name only,"" he said in a statement, adding that May had ""betrayed the nation"".
""True Brexiteers have been backed into a corner and the only option now is to go back to the polls and let the people shout from the rooftops their support of a true Brexit.""
May, an ex-""Remainer"" facing demands by powerful euroceptics in her party for a clean break from the EU, has committed to leaving the bloc's single market and customs union, and said Britain should be prepared to walk away without an exit deal.
But, with business leaders' alarmed at the specter of ""no deal"", she has made clear this is a last resort and that agreeing a divorce allowing for ""frictionless"" trade and financial and security links with the EU is the best option. 
Many of the Remain camp in Britain now focus on securing a soft Brexit rather than another referendum but some, including ex-Labour prime minister Tony Blair, say Brexit should be halted to safeguard Britain's economy and international standing.
Negotiations on Britain's future trade relationship with the EU are to start in earnest in the spring.
A number of lawmakers are arguing for a second public vote on the terms of the exit deal, saying Britons were asked in the 2016 referendum only whether they wanted to leave the EU, not about the conditions of departure.
Some hardline pro-Brexit groups argue that May has crumbled in negotiations so far by agreeing to pay a 35-39 billion pound ($47-$52 billion) divorce bill and seek a staggered withdrawal from the EU.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's admission that soldiers were involved in the murder of 10 Muslims in September was an important step and the United States hoped it would be followed by more transparency and accountability, the U.S. ambassador said on Thursday.
The European Union and representatives of Muslim nations renewed calls for a broader international investigation into violence in the western state of Rakhine, after the military said on Wednesday its soldiers had killed 10 captured Rohingya Muslim ""terrorists"" at the beginning of September.
It was a rare acknowledgment of wrongdoing by the Myanmar military during the operation it launched in northern Rakhine in response to Rohingya militant attacks on Aug. 25. Since then, more than 650,000 Muslim villagers have fled to Bangladesh.
""The military's acknowledgment that the security forces were involved in the killing of these 10 individuals is an important step,"" Ambassador Scot Marciel said in a forum on media freedom with journalism students and reporters in the main city Yangon.
""We hope it is followed up by more transparency and by holding those responsible accountable. I would stress this should be done, not as a favour to the international community, but because it's good for the health of Myanmar's democracy.""
    The United States has previously said the sweeping military counteroffensive amounted to ""ethnic cleansing"". Myanmar denies that, saying its forces were carrying out legitimate ""clearance operations"" against insurgents.
MASS GRAVE
The military announced on Dec. 18 that a mass grave containing 10 bodies had been found at the coastal village of Inn Din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of the state capital Sittwe. The army appointed a senior officer to investigate.
    A statement from the office of the commander-in-chief on Wednesday said the military's investigation had found that members of the security forces had killed the 10.
The military said legal action would be taken against members of the security forces who violated their rules of engagement in killing the 10 suspected insurgents, and against ethnic Rakhine Buddhist villagers who were also involved.
It said the 10 had been captured after security forces had come under attack from around 200 insurgents.
The captives should have been handed over to police, the army statement said, but with militants mounting continuous attacks and destroying two military vehicles, ""there were no conditions to transfer the 10 Bengali terrorists to the police station and so it was decided to kill them"".
Myanmar's civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has no control over the military, but has faced fierce international criticism for failing to do more to protect the Rohingya.
Asked about Wednesday's statement from the military, her spokesman Zaw Htay said Myanmar was committed to following the rule of law and took allegations of abuses seriously.
""The government is not issuing blanket denials of accusations of human rights violations issued by the international community,"" he said. ""We need to get strong and reliable evidence so that we can investigate and take action according to the law.""
CALLS FOR INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION
The Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation said the admission substantiated allegations made by human rights groups and the United Nations of ethnic cleansing against ""the most persecuted Rohingya people"".
The EU and Norway said in a statement issued in Yangon that the killings at Inn Din ""confirm the urgent need for a thorough and credible investigation into all violent incidents in northern Rakhine State to ensure the accountability of those found responsible for committing atrocities"".
Myanmar's armed forces have for decades been accused by human rights groups and Western governments of abuses in the country's myriad ethnic conflicts, but it has been rare for soldiers to be held accountable.
An admission by a top general in July 2016 that soldiers had killed five villagers during an interrogation in northern Shan State was seen at the time as unprecedented. Seven soldiers were subsequently jailed for five years with hard labor.

Republicans have criticized former President Barack Obama following a December Politico report that the Obama administration hindered a Drug Enforcement Administration program targeting Hezbollah's trafficking operations during its negotiation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
Republican President Donald Trump says Obama gave away too much to Iran to secure the agreement, which gives Iran relief from sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.
Sessions said the Justice Department will assemble leading investigators and prosecutors for the Hezbollah Financing and Narcoterrorism Team to ensure all investigations under the DEA program, called Project Cassandra, will be completed.

""The Justice Department will leave no stone unturned in order to eliminate threats to our citizens from terrorist organizations and to stem the tide of the devastating drug crisis,"" Sessions said.

1653,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Austrian president seeks to reassure Holocaust survivors on government,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria's president pledged to be vigilant against anti-Semitism and xenophobia on Thursday after a Holocaust survivors group expressed concern about the new government that includes a far-right party founded by former Nazis. 
Last month the Freedom Party (FPO) entered government as the junior coalition partner to Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservatives after a parliamentary election in which both pledged to stop illegal immigration and to fight radical Islam.
""For me, the coalition with the far-right FPO... poses a danger for Austria,"" 94-year-old Austrian Holocaust survivor Aba Lewit said in an open letter published by the Austrian Mauthausen Committee, which represents survivors of the Mauthausen concentration camp in northern Austria.
""I will work to ensure for the duration of my tenure that destructive nationalism, xenophobia, right-wing extremism and anti-Semitism have no place in Austria,"" President Alexander Van der Bellen replied.
""I have pointed out (in talks with the cabinet) that there is a need for mindfulness when it comes to the use of language. How we deal with words and formulations is not irrelevant. They form our consciousness and later our reality.""
Earlier on Thursday, Interior Minister Herbert Kickl of the FPO said asylum seekers should be ""concentrated"" in special centers to help the authorities process their applications swiftly.
For many observers, Kickl's wording evoked Nazi-era concentration camps, and his remark soon made headlines in Austrian media. Several opposition parties also criticized his choice of words.
""I expect a real and believable apology from the interior minister,"" said Steffi Krisper of the liberal Neos party. ""It looks like a deliberate provocation which is subsequently denied in a half-hearted fashion."" 
When asked by reporters whether he had deliberately chosen the word ""concentrated"", Kickl said there was no need for a ""semantic discussion"" and that he did not mean to provoke anyone.
Kurz's government has repeatedly criticized the current system under which accommodation for asylum seekers is largely provided by aid groups such as the Red Cross, which outsource some activities to private contractors. It argues that the current system is inefficient.
Nazis held and killed millions of Jews, political dissenters, disabled people, Roma and Sinti among others in concentration camps during World War Two. Nazi Germany annexed Austria, where Adolf Hitler was born, in 1938. 
The FPO says it has left its founders' Nazi past behind it and now denounces anti-Semitism while openly courting Jewish voters, with little obvious success. It has, however, had to expel several officials in recent years over Nazi allegations.

Austria's main Jewish body this week said it would continue a self-imposed ban on political contact with the FPO.

1654,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 10:59AM ET</span>",Turkey's top court rules two jailed journalists be released: media,"By Tuvan Gumrukcu
ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's top court on Thursday ruled that two jailed journalists be released, local media reported, a decision lawyers said could set a precedent for dozens of other reporters jailed in a widespread crackdown under President Tayyip Erdogan.
The Constitutional Court ordered the release of Mehmet Altan and Sahin Alpay, ruling their rights had been violated, CNN Turk and other local media reported. The two, in prison for more than year, have been accused of links to terrorist groups and attempting to overthrow the government, charges they deny.
Officials at the Constitutional Court were not immediately available for comment. Lawyers for the journalists did not immediately respond for requests for comment.
The two, along with a third journalist, Turhan Gunay, had argued their arrests were not legal and their rights and freedoms had been violated in pre-trial detention. Eleven of the court's judges ruled in their favor, and six against, the opposition Cumhuriyet newspaper reported.
Gunay, a Cumhuriyet journalist, had already been released in September in a decision in a separate case. The court ruled on Thursday that Gunay's rights were also violated by his time in detention, Cumhuriyet said.
Altan, a professor of economics and a frequent commentator in liberal media, and Alpay, a columnist, were jailed in the aftermath of a failed coup in 2016, when Erdogan launched wide-ranging purges that put more than 50,000 people in jail and led to the closure of more than 130 media outlets. 
Around 160 journalists have been jailed, according to the Turkish Journalists' Association. International journalism groups say Turkey is now the world's largest jailer of journalists.
Many of the jailed reporters have been charged with spreading propaganda for the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) or the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of masterminding the abortive putsch.
LEGAL PRECEDENT
Alpay wrote for the now-defunct Zaman, widely seen as the Gulen movement's flagship newspaper before its seizure and subsequent closure by authorities. Gulen, a former Erdogan ally, has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999. He has denied orchestrating the coup and condemned it as against democracy. 
Lawyers have said the case could set a legal precedent for how the court treats other reporters - including foreigners - now in jail in Turkey.
""The decision by the Constitutional Court on Mehmet Altan and Sahin Albay is correct, but insufficient,"" Baris Yarkadas, a lawmaker from the opposition CHP party said on Twitter. ""The (Court) should take a step to ensure the freedom of all arrested journalists. It should carry out its mission and end victimization.""
Erdogan has said that some journalists helped nurture terrorists through their writing. ""Terror doesn't form by itself,"" he said last week at a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. ""Terror and terrorists have gardeners. These gardeners are those people viewed as thinkers.""

ABUJA (Reuters) - More than 15,000 Cameroonian refugees have fled to Nigeria amid a crackdown on Anglophone separatists, the United Nations (UN) refugee agency and Nigerian government officials said on Thursday.
(Cameroon refugee crisis graphic http://tmsnrt.rs/2Djfjx5) 
The once-fringe English-speaking movement in majority French-speaking Cameroon has gathered pace in the last few months after a military crackdown on protests, leading it to declare independence in October for a breakaway ""Ambazonia"" state it wants to create. 
The move poses the biggest challenge yet to the 35-year rule of President Paul Biya, who will seek re-election this year, and the violent repression he has unleashed has driven thousands of people from English-speaking regions across the border into Nigeria.
More than 8,000 refugees have been registered in the southeastern state of Cross River alone, said Antonio Jose Canhandula, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR) representative in Nigeria, at a briefing in Abuja.
A further 6,700 or so Cameroonian refugees have crossed into neighboring Benue state, said Sadiya Umar Farouq, the head of Nigeria's National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons, citing Benue officials.
There are also at least 350 refugees in the states of Taraba and Akwa Ibom, said Tamuno Dienye Jaja, deputy comptroller general of the Nigeria Immigration Service.
The refugees are mostly children, women and the elderly, with very few young men, the officials said.
""Certainly there are more, how many more we are not able to state,"" said the UNHCR's Canhandula.
""They are still coming, and they are coming daily,"" he said. ""It is a crisis.""
More food assistance, education and social services are needed, particularly as a number of the women are pregnant at a young age, were are all issues, Canhandula said.
Nigeria's Farouq pledged the government's support.
""We are going to do all that we can to bring some kind of relief,"" she said.
Nigerian and Cameroonian officials have met to discuss the refugees and those talks are ongoing, she said, although she declined to give details.
The separatist movement, including armed radical elements, has strained bilateral relations between the two countries.
Last week, Nigerian authorities took 12 leaders of the separatists, including the chairman of the self-declared Governing Council of Ambazonia, into custody after they gathered for a meeting in a hotel in the Nigerian capital Abuja, people familiar with the matter said.
Cameroonian troops last month crossed into Nigeria in pursuit of rebels without seeking Nigerian authorization, leading to diplomatic wrangling behind the scenes.
The unrest in Cameroon began in November, when English-speaking teachers and lawyers in the Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon that neighbor Nigeria, frustrated with having to work in French, took to the streets calling for reforms and greater autonomy. French is the official language for most of Cameroon, but English is spoken in the two regions.

1656,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",Czech PM Babis supports incumbent Zeman in presidential election,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis backed incumbent Milos Zeman in the country's presidential election, which starts with a first round on Friday and Saturday.
The billionaire businessman said he would vote for Zeman, 73, for his honesty, political experience and defense of national interests, despite what he described as Zeman's ""polarising"" impact on Czech society.
The Czech presidency is largely ceremonial but has an important role in picking who should form a government. Babis's anti-establishment ANO party won more than twice as many seats as any other group in an October vote but still fell far short of a majority. 
The endorsement of Zeman by Babis was expected, as Zeman has backed Babis to form a government. So far all eight other parliamentary factions have refused to back an ANO government.
""I see him as a strong personality which is polarising society, but mainly as someone who does not steal, who has results, who keeps his word... and unlike other politicians, he does not live from politics, he lives for politics,"" Babis told a news conference.
""He is a man who fights for our national interests, he is not afraid to clearly state his opinion on Brussels, (migration) quotas, he fights for the interests of our entrepreneurs.""
Babis stressed that any government he leads would hold a foreign policy course based on the country's EU and NATO membership. Zeman, a former center-left prime minister who has drifted towards anti-immigration far-right parties, has devoted effort to developing relations with Russia and China. 
Zeman leads opinion polls against a crowded field of challengers, but could face a tougher threat from a single opponent in a run-off in two weeks if he does not win outright in the first round. Final polls showed the most serious challenger was non-partisan academic Jiri Drahos. [nL8N1P0380]
Zeman's first five-year term ends on March 7, giving time for more talks before then on forming a government, regardless of who wins the election. If the talks stretch out beyond then, Babis may have a harder time with some of Zeman's opponents.
The main reason why most other parties refuse to work with Babis is that he faces investigation over alleged fraud when receiving a European Union subsidy a decade ago. He denies any wrongdoing.
He is facing a confidence vote for his minority government next week with almost no chance of winning. Zeman has promised to give Babis a second chance to form a government if the first attempt fails.

The Czech lower house on Wednesday postponed the confidence vote until Jan. 16 or later as lawmakers tussled over the fraud allegations and whether to lift his parliamentary immunity to allow prosecution. [nL8N1P51GX]

1657,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>","Turkey to end extraditions to U.S. unless cleric is turned over, Erdogan says","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will not extradite any suspects to the United States if Washington does not hand over the cleric Ankara blames for orchestrating a failed 2016 military coup, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday.
Ankara accuses U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen of masterminding the putsch and has repeatedly asked Washington for his extradition. U.S. officials have said courts require sufficient evidence to extradite the elderly cleric who has denied any involvement in the coup.
""We have given the United States 12 terrorists so far, but they have not given us back the one we want. They made up excuses from thin air,"" Erdogan told local administrators at a conference in his presidential palace in Ankara.
""If you're not giving him (Gulen) to us, then excuse us, but from now on whenever you ask us for another terrorist, as long as I am in office, you will not get them,"" he said.
Turkey is the biggest Muslim country in NATO and an important U.S. ally in the Middle East.
But Ankara and Washington have been at loggerheads over a wide range of issues in recent months, including a U.S. alliance with Kurdish fighters in Syria and the conviction of a Turkish bank executive in a U.S. sanctions-busting case that included testimony of corruption by senior Turkish officials.
On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said ties were harmed by Washington's failure to extradite Gulen and U.S. support for Syria's Kurdish YPG militia and its PYD political arm. He said relations could deteriorate further.
""The United States does not listen to us, but it listens to the PYD/YPG. Can there be such a strategic partnership?... Turkey is not a country that will be tripped up by the United States' inconsistent policies in the region,"" Erdogan said.
Last week, a U.S. jury convicted an executive of Turkey's majority state-owned Halkbank of evading U.S. sanctions on Iran, in a case which Erdogan has condemned as a ""political coup attempt"" and a joint effort by the CIA, FBI and Gulen's network to undermine Turkey.

The two countries also suspended issuing visas for months last year over a dispute following the detention of two locally employed U.S. consulate workers in Turkey on suspicion of links to the failed 2016 coup.

The Misratan counter-terrorism official, who asked not to be named for security reasons, said he had surrendered at a checkpoint near Abu Grain town, but it was not immediately clear why he had handed himself in.
Abu Grain is about 100 km (60 miles) south of Misrata and 140 km west of Sirte, a city that Islamic State controlled until they were driven out by a Misratan-led military campaign in 2016.
""The suspect handed himself in to the security forces early morning on Thursday,"" the official told Reuters. ""The car bomb is now being dismantled by explosives experts."" 
Since Islamic State's defeat in Sirte, Libyan and Western security officials say militants have been trying to regroup in desert areas to the south, where they were targeted last year by several U.S. air strikes.
They have occasionally set up temporary checkpoints, and had done so in two places on a remote road in the area early on Wednesday, the Misratan official said.
Islamic State also claimed a deadly attack on a courthouse complex in Misrata last year.

1659,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 09:24AM ET</span>",Shopping for nursing homes more tricky in Trump era,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Finding a safe, high-quality nursing home for a loved one is never an easy task. Complicated decisions often are made at a moment of emotional crisis and reliable guidance can be difficult to come by.
And it is going to get more difficult. The Trump administration is moving quickly to deregulate nursing homes, complying with a wish list submitted by industry lobbying groups. Consumer advocates worry that the changes will lead to deterioration in safety and the quality of care delivered to some of the most vulnerable Americans.
Just before the holidays, news broke that the Trump administration is curtailing the use of penalties against nursing homes that harm their residents or put them at risk of injury. 
The story, first reported in the New York Times is just the latest in a series of rapid-fire moves by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to loosen, delay or strip away regulation of nursing homes.
In November, CMS exempted nursing homes that violate new patient safety rules from financial penalties for 18 months. In June, it proposed to reverse an Obama administration rule prohibiting clauses in residents’ contracts requiring them to use arbitration to settle disputes rather than go to court.
“The industry sees this administration as a real golden opportunity to get what it wants,” said Toby Edelman, senior policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy (CMA), a nonprofit group that provides Medicare-related education, advocacy and legal assistance to seniors.
CMS has broad authority to regulate nursing homes that accept patients covered by Medicare and Medicaid - virtually all nursing homes in the United States. Its recent moves will take an industry where enforcement of rules has been weak, and make it weaker still, Edelman argues.
Nursing homes subject to the Obama penalty rules generally were limited to those suspected of harming residents or placing them in immediate jeopardy. The repeal of CMS guidance in this area will leave even these nursing facilities facing looser regulation.
DOING THE HOMEWORK
Nursing home choices often are made during stressful times for families, when a patient’s hospital stay is ending and the shift to a skilled nursing facility is imminent. That leaves the door open to rapid, emotion-driven decision making. “So don’t do that,” urged Robyn Grant, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care.
“It’s really a good idea to do a little research before a crisis emerges,” she said. “If something happened to me or a family member, where do I want to go?”
Unfortunately, information rating the quality of nursing homes is spotty. A good starting point is Medicare’s system for rating nursing homes for quality of care and staffing levels, called Nursing Home Compare The system rates nursing homes on a scale of 1 to 5 and is considered the industry authority. 
But much of the data that determines ratings is self-reported by nursing homes, and the ratings do not take into account negative information such as fines and enforcement actions by states. And reviews of this system have found numerous cases of facilities attempting to “game” the system.
One study published last year of California nursing homes between 2009 and 2013 found inflated star ratings. Forty percent of the facilities received four or five stars in 2009, but that had risen to 60 percent in 2013. The researchers found little correlation between the ratings and actual health inspections by state regulators.
Nursing home shoppers also should consult Nursing Home Inspect, an online database created and maintained by ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative news service The database contains state-by-state breakdowns displaying fines and deficiencies turned up by inspections, and it flags nursing homes with histories of serious quality issues.
Grant recommends checking on any facility you are considering with your state’s long-term care ombudsman, a program administered by the Administration on Aging. Consumer Voice offers a directory of state ombudsmen on its website 
A trusted physician also can be a good resource, she said. “Ask them about experience with facilities. Ask a trusted doctor, 'What facilities would you go into if you needed one?'”
She also recommends checking with friends who have had experience with facilities under consideration. Geriatric care managers - human service professionals who help coordinate care for the elderly and their families - also can help navigate the nursing home maze.
But consumer vigilance is an incomplete response to the rollback of regulatory protections now under way. “We’re talking about one of the most vulnerable populations in the country - many don’t have family living nearby or don’t have family members at all who can look out for them,” Grant said. And CMS data shows that 61 percent of nursing home residents in 2014 suffered from moderate or severe cognitive impairment, which means many will struggle to look out for their own interests. 

“If you are concerned about the quality of care in nursing homes now, you have no idea what will happen if we take away these protections.”

BARDONECCHIA, Italy (Reuters) - It took Abdullhai almost three years to get from his home in Guinea to a rocky, snow-covered Alpine mountain pass in the dead of winter, for what he hopes will be the final stage of his journey into France. 
The terrain is steep and dangerous and he and a group of five other migrants face risks ranging from losing their footing on steep drops, being struck by falling rocks or succumbing to the -9C (15°F) temperatures in clothing ill-suited to the terrain.
Abdullhai, 38, is one of hundreds of migrants who over the last year have attempted to cross from Italy into France through high mountain passes, in a bid to evade increased border security put in place at easier crossing points. His group crossed into France in December.
In Guinea, he left behind his wife and three children, including a two-year old son whom he has never seen.
""Our life in Guinea is not good,"" said Abdullhai, 38, who like his friends asked that his last name not be published in this story.
""There is no work there and no future for my children. Here in Europe we can have a future. We can find work and live a life with some dignity. This is worth a try for me.""
The number of migrants making perilous journeys has fallen since over one million arrived in Europe from the Middle East and Africa in 2015. There were 171,635 arrivals by boat officially recorded in 2017, down from 363,504 in 2016.
As the group huddled around a fire in a cave during a rest on their journey, others told stories of being jailed and tortured, or of being orphaned and looking at uncertain futures in their home country.
The crossings have become more perilous with heavy snowfall.
On Jan. 10, Reuters spoke with three migrants, a 24-year-old Senegalese man, a 31-year-old man from the Democratic Republic of Congo and a 37-year-old from Pakistan who were attempting to cross into France.
They managed to cross the border, but abandoned their trek, exhausted and despondent, and were returned to Italy.
But they are at least alive. The International Organisation for Migration estimates that 20,000 people have died in the Mediterranean itself while trying to reach Italy.
Nor does it compare to the hardships that some of those making the journey have already endured to get as far as they have.
""I was imprisoned and tortured in Libya for many months. I was forced to work for free. Just look at my scars,"" said Kamarra, 28, from Guinea, lifting his shirt and pulling down his trousers at the side to show marks on his body and hip. 
""After all that, crossing the Alps is not a big deal for me.""

Spokesman Greg Burke said the pope would meet ""two victims of the 1970s repression"" next Thursday on his last day in Chile before leaving for Peru on the second leg of his trip.
Burke said he did not yet have details of the two people who would meet Francis after a Mass in the Chilean city of Iquique. The meeting was not on the original schedule of the trip.
Pinochet overthrew the democratically elected socialist government of Salvador Allende in September 1973 and his dictatorship lasted until 1990. He died in 2006.
His secret police collaborated with dictatorships in neighboring Argentina and in Brazil amid a wider crackdown called ""Operation Condor.""
During Pinochet’s rule, some 3,000 people died or disappeared in Chile, and thousands more - including current President Michelle Bachelet - were tortured or went into exile.
Last year, a Chilean judge ordered jail sentences for more than 100 former secret police from Pinochet's dictatorship, the biggest mass sentence to date for human rights abuses from the period.
Chile long grappled with the task of bringing to justice the perpetrators of crimes committed in that era but crusading judges and more sympathetic authorities have led to an increase in convictions in recent years.

1662,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Syrian rebels declare counter attack in Idlib province,"BEIRUT/AMMAN (Reuters) - Rebels launched a counter attack against Syrian government forces and their allies in Idlib province on Thursday, seeking to roll back an advance that is fuelling tension with neighboring Turkey. 
Fighting raged in the area, where a government offensive backed by Iran-backed militia has gathered pace in the last two weeks, according to rebels and a military news service run by the Lebanese group Hezbollah, which is fighting on the government side.
Idlib province is the biggest chunk of Syria still held by rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad, with a population swollen by Syrians who have fled government advances in other parts of the country. Assad has defeated rebels in many parts of western Syria with critical help from Russia and Iran.
The recent military escalation in western Syria has included an unprecedented attack by a squadron of drones on Russian military bases and has cast a shadow over Moscow's efforts to convene a Syria peace congress later this month. 
The Hezbollah-run news service said the army and its allies were repelling a ""fierce assault"" by the Nusra Front, formerly al Qaeda's affiliate in the Syrian war, and groups linked to it.
Rebels fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) said in a statement they had set up a joint operations room to repel the offensive and to take back areas seized by the government in northeastern Hama and southern Idlib.
""The operation is to hit the belly of the regime deep into liberated territories and to encircle their advancing forces,"" said Abdul Hakim al Rahamon, a senior official in Jaish al Nasr, an FSA faction taking part.
Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an alliance led by the Nusra Front, the dominant force in Idlib, said it had already made gains.
""With Allah's) blessings we drew plans and prepared ourselves and are encircling them,"" said Abu al Naji, a commander from Tahrir al Sham. ""We have killed many.""
Rebels said they had captured some 15 villages and seized 60 government fighters. A Syrian military source denied this and dismissed rebel talk of a counter attack as propaganda. The source said fierce battles were however underway in the area and army advances were continuing.
Rebel sources said warplanes had struck Khan Sheikhoun and Saraqeb, two major population centers in Idlib province that are among several towns that have been targeted in the latest offensive.
The latest push by the army and its allies has alarmed Turkey which has been deploying forces inside northern Idlib and setting up bases which it says are part of agreements with Iran and Russia over a descalation zone in Idlib.
The Turkish government said the Idlib offensive was endangering the effort to reach a resolution of the conflict and accused the Syrian government of using the pretext of fighting militants to wage a widescale attack. 
Ankara is concerned that wider fighting in the province could bring tens of thousands of Syrians fleeing from the battlefields on its borders far beyond the numbers now fleeing.

Many Syrians living in rebel-held areas see Turkey's military intervention as a bulwark against a relentless bombing campaign by Syrian and Russian airforces they blame for killing and injuring hundreds of civilians in urban areas in recent months, away from the frontlines.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain, France and Germany made a joint plea to Donald Trump on Thursday to uphold a pact stopping Iran getting nuclear weapons, a day before the U.S. president is expected to decide whether to re-impose sanctions in a move likely to sink the deal.
In sharp contrast to Trump's view that the 2015 pact was ""the worst deal ever negotiated"", the foreign ministers of the three countries and the EU's top diplomat said there was no alternative to it and that sanctions should remain lifted.
""We agree on this approach, we want to protect (the deal) against every possible decision that might undermine it,"" Germany's Sigmar Gabriel said alongside his French and British counterparts and EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini after meeting Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.
""It is absolutely necessary to have this to prevent the development of nuclear weapons at a time when other parts of the world are discussing how to get them,"" Gabriel said.
The meeting in Brussels was choreographed to send a message to Washington before Trump is due to decide whether to re-impose oil sanctions lifted under the deal. [nS0N1O400B] If that happens, Iran has said it would no longer be bound by the pact and could return to producing enriched uranium. [nL8N1P52PF]
Zarif tweeted that the meeting had shown a ""strong consensus"" that Iran was complying with the pact, had the right to enjoy its economic benefits and ""any move that undermines (it) is unacceptable"". 
""E3 (Germany, France and Britain) and EU fully aware that Iran's continued compliance (is) conditioned on full compliance by the US,"" Zarif added.
European countries have benefited from renewed trade with Iran as sanctions have been lifted, while U.S. companies are still largely barred from doing business with the Islamic Republic due to other sanctions unrelated to the nuclear issue. 
""CLOSE SURVEILLANCE""
""The deal is working. It is delivering on its main goal which means keeping the Iranian nuclear programme in check and under close surveillance,"" Mogherini said, adding that the International Atomic Energy Agency had shown in nine reports that Iran is meeting its commitments.
Trump formally rejected the deal in October, although the United States has not yet pulled out.
That major shift in U.S. policy put the United States at odds with its European allies, as well as Russia and China that are also signatories to the nuclear accord, in the most visible transatlantic split on foreign policy since the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.
European governments are troubled by Trump's ""America first"" rhetoric and inconsistent statements on NATO and the European Union, while they consider the Iran nuclear deal one of West's the biggest diplomatic achievements in decades.
France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the deal should be kept in place so that Europe and the United States could move on to other issues, such as confronting Iran over its missile programme and involvement in wars in Yemen and Syria.
""We do not hide other disagreements, which exist ... both in the ballistic field and over Iran's action in the whole region,"" Le Drian said, adding that Europe viewed those issues as separate from the nuclear one. 

Gabriel said Zarif had agreed to discuss the issues in a more regular and structured way, but gave no details.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel has given final building approval for 352 homes in settlements in the occupied West Bank, an anti-settlement movement said on Thursday - construction that Palestinians see as jeopardizing their prospects for statehood.
The Peace Now group said a meeting on Wednesday by a planning committee of Israel's military-run Civil Administration for the West Bank also moved plans for 770 other settler homes to more advanced stages.
Settlements are one of the most heated issues in efforts to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, frozen since 2014.
""I think what Israel is doing is a purposeful, well-planned process of destruction of the two-state solution and possibility of the establishment of a Palestinian state,"" Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian lawmaker, said of the committee's decision.
Palestinians want the West Bank for a future state, along with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Most countries consider as illegal the settlements that Israel built in the territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Israel disputes that its settlements are illegal. Its government says their future should be determined in peace talks and that the Palestinians' refusal to recognize Israel as a Jewish state and declare an end to a decades-old conflict are the real obstacles to peace.
Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas that are home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians.
Hagit Ofran, a Peace Now spokeswoman, said the new round of construction approvals was ""not a dramatic change"" from last year's pace, when Israel gave the go-ahead for 6,742 housing projects in the West Bank - a figure described by Peace Now as the highest since 2013.
But she noted that many of the latest housing projects were slated for settlements deep inside the West Bank, ""especially in places that Israel would need to (evacuate) in case of a (peace) agreement - which means our government is trying to prevent a two-state solution"".
Barghouti linked the increased settlement activity to the 2016 election of U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican who has been less critical than his predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, of Israel on the issue.
""These settlements could have been stopped by the United States,"" he told Reuters.
The latest construction plans were first announced by Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman earlier this week.
Asked about them, a U.S. State Department official said on Tuesday there had been no change in policy on settlements and the Israeli government had made clear that going forward ""its intent is to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity that takes the president's concerns into consideration.""

1665,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Greeks to strike over right-to-strike bill,"By Lefteris Papadimas
ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek subway workers, dockers and state-employed doctors plan to strike on Friday in the country's first major industrial action of 2018, to protest a new law that will restrict their right to walk off the job.
Parliament is expected on Jan. 15 to vote through the contentious reform, which would tighten rules on declaring work stoppages, a condition set by creditors who have loaned Greece billions since 2010.
At present, Greek unions can call strikes with the support of one third of their members. The new law would raise that requirement to 50 percent, which creditors hope would limit the frequency of strikes and improve productivity that lags about 20 percent behind the EU average, according to OECD data.
Strikes are so common in Greece that there is a website dedicated to them.
Friday's stoppage is being backed by several unions, including GSEE, the largest private-sector one.
""It is essentially scrapping the only weapon workers have left to protect themselves, particularly after collective working agreements were shelved,"" said GSEE spokesman Dimitris Karageorgopoulos.
Stavros Kafounis, head of the Commercial Association of Athens, which represents retailers, said strikes amplified the country's economic problems.
""Every time there is labour action in public transport it shuts businesses down, adding to already slow business,"" he said.
BITTER PILL
A majority of lawmakers are expected to vote in favor of the bill, which will be a bitter pill to swallow for a government dominated by the leftist Syriza movement.
With its roots in labor activism, the party swept to power in 2015 promising to end austerity, only to accept another bailout months later.
Hundreds of Greeks marched through Athens on Tuesday and confronted authorities demanding the bill be rescinded. Labour Minister Effie Achtsioglou refused.
Greece needs to pass the regulation and a raft of other measures for lenders to sign off on a review of progress in its bailout program, which the country hopes to exit this summer.
Monday's parliamentary bill also seeks to introduce electronic auctions that could facilitate foreclosures to wrestle down a mountain of toxic debts weighing on the country's banks, rationalize spending on state benefits, set targets for selling off assets of power utility PPC, and regulations on the operation of casinos.
One union leader said that, regardless of new legislation, workers would continue to strike.
""If they don't like it let them fire us... or arrest us,"" said Spyros Revithis, head of a public transport workers' union that staged 15 strikes in 2017.
""This government is a Trojan Horse of neo-liberalism on labor rights.""

Over five years in office, Xi has accrued more power than any of his immediate predecessors and has waged a war on graft in the ruling Communist Party. He has also intensified efforts to ensure cadres are disciplined, upright and honest.
Nevertheless, his latest call for unwavering discipline, delivered in a lengthy speech live-streamed to party officials around the country, was unusual in its bluntness.
""When the party centre makes a policy decision, all party groups must put it into practice to the letter,"" Xi said in the speech directed at the central party leadership, according to the CCTV state broadcaster.
""At any time and in any situation, the party's leading officials must stand firm and be trustworthy in their politics, be sincerely devoted to the party, be in one mind with the party centre,"" he said. 
Efforts in party building are a ""fundamental guarantee"" of finally achieving the Chinese dream, Xi said, referring to an aspiration to restore a rejuvenated China to its full standing globally.
Officials who fail to carry out their political duty must be held accountable, Xi said.
He also re-iterated that there would be no let-up in efforts to tackle deep-rooted graft within the party.
""As soon as a 'tiger' rears his head, we will strike at once; as soon as a 'fly' flies in disorder, we will swat,"" he said, referring to high- and low-level officials.

China's top corruption watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, said that 527,000 people were disciplined for graft in 2017, with 58 being high-level cadres, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

A criminal court had sentenced Adly, who served under former President Hosni Mubarak before his fall to a popular uprising in 2011, to seven years in prison in April after convicting him on charges of abusing public funds. 
The Court of Cassation, Egypt's top court whose decisions cannot be appealed, threw out Adly's conviction over procedural errors and ordered a retrial at a different criminal court, the judicial sources said.
His lawyer, Farid el-Deeb, told Reuters that the decision allows for Adly, who did not attend the hearing, to be freed without further legal procedures. 
A copy of the April verdict obtained by Reuters showed that Adly and two other ministry officials were ordered to refund a total of 1.95 billion Egyptian pounds ($109.83 million) and were fined the same amount. 
A long-serving official at the apex of Egypt's feared internal security apparatus, Adly was acquitted of other graft charges two years ago.

He was also cleared in 2014, along with Mubarak and six aides, of charges related to killings of protesters during the 2011 ""Arab Spring"" uprising.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary will hold a parliamentary election on April 8, President Janos Ader announced on Thursday, a contest likely to give Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling Fidesz party a third successive term in power.
Orban has used the past eight years in office to rewrite the constitution and centralize power, filling posts at the central bank, the State Audit Office and the prosecution with party loyalists.
His reforms, such as hefty sectoral levies and measures affecting the judiciary and the media, have triggered conflicts with the European Union. Budapest and Brussels have also tussled over migration, which Orban strongly opposes.
But Orban's reforms have put the economy on track for growth of about four percent this year, the budget deficit has remained under the EU's three percent of gross domestic product threshold and Hungary's large debt pile has also declined in past years. 
Ruling Fidesz party lawmaker Gergely Gulyas told a news conference that Fidesz, which is well ahead of the main opposition nationalist Jobbik party in the latest opinion polls, might not publish an election manifesto.
""In case of a ruling party, no information about how we plan to govern the country is more credible than the eight years we have left behind,"" Gulyas told a news conference.
Orban's re-election could bring about further clashes with the EU, as Budapest has already signaled it would veto any sanctions against regional neighbor Poland over its reforms affecting the judiciary.
Orban has also ruled out taking part in any EU-wide mechanism to settle migrants from the Middle East in Hungary, saying the Christian country, which has no history of large-scale immigration, should preserve its ""ethnic homogeneity.""
With the Socialists slipping to a distant third in the polls since the resignation of their candidate for prime minister last year, the nationalist Jobbik has emerged as Orban's main challenger in the April vote.
Months before the election, Jobbik, which is projecting a moderate image to lure supporters from other mainstream parties, was slapped with a punitive fine over a political billboard campaign backed by a one-time Orban ally.
Gulyas said there was no link between the timing of the fine and the election campaign, saying any fines should be paid only after the vote.

Critics and opposition parties have also accused Fidesz of cronyism, pointing to the rise of businessmen close to the government, such as Orban's childhood friend, Lorinc Meszaros, who has built a sprawling business empire.

1669,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 07:18AM ET</span>",Merkel sees 'tough day' in crunch German coalition talks,"By Andreas Rinke
BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel said her conservatives still had high hurdles to clear in Thursday's talks on forming a coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD), who are pressing for accelerated European integration.
Merkel, weakened by an election setback in September, turned to the left-leaning SPD to seek a re-run of their so-called ""grand coalition"" after the collapse in November of talks on a three-way coalition untested at national level.
The chancellor, who commands wide respect abroad after more than 12 years in power, needs coalition talks to succeed to avoid further erosion of her personal authority and weakening of German international influence, not least in the European Union (EU).
Speaking at the start of the final day of exploratory talks that could lead to formal negotiations, Merkel said it would be a tough day but she recognized that Germans expected results.
""Of course we also have in mind that we have to create a good policy platform for our country. So it's going to be a tough day,"" she said.
SPD leader Martin Schulz, a former president of the European Parliament, made clear his priority was Europe.
""On the last day of exploratory talks we will make clear that above all this must be a new start for the European Union,"" he told reporters. ""If we join a government it will be on the condition that it makes Europe strong.""
Schulz has called for a United States of Europe by 2025 - an idea rejected by senior conservatives, many of whom are wary of such ambitious reform plans they fear could see Germany funnel more of its taxpayers' money to other EU states.
However, Merkel helped lead Europe through its twin euro zone and refugee crises and is adept at finding compromises, especially on European issues.
Should the parties fail to reach a deal on Thursday they could extend the talks, though President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is eager for an agreement, keenly aware that businesses want a stable coalition to end uncertainty and avoid another vote.
SPD HURDLE
In signs of incremental progress in the talks, negotiators agreed to reduce use of the weed killer glyphosate, draft plans seen by Reuters showed.
SPD Secretary General Lars Klingbeil told party members in a video message the party was striving for improvements in labor, health, education and family policy, and on Europe.
""We're fighting for that,"" he said in a video message, adding that the final day of exploratory talks would show ""whether we can cut through the knot on these big issues"".
Participants have described the negotiations as ""good"", but SPD leaders need to convince their party members and are offering them a vote on Jan. 21 on whether to proceed.
Merkel has ruled with the SPD in a sometimes unwieldy ""grand coalition"" - or 'GroKo' - in two of her three previous terms in office, including in the last parliament from 2013-2017.
But both parties bled support in the Sept. 24 election, which saw the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) enter the Bundestag lower house of parliament for the first time.
Many SPD rank-and-file fear a repeat grand coalition would further diminish the identity of the party, which suffered its worst result in September's vote since the modern Federal Republic was founded in 1949. Some SPD members are also concerned a new grand coalition would make the AfD the main opposition party.
Kevin Kuehnert, head of the Jusos youth branch of the SPD, said he planned to embark on a 'NoGroKo' tour of Germany to persuade party delegates to vote against the grand coalition.

Should the two biggest party groups fail to agree on moving ahead, Merkel, albeit reluctantly, could try to form a minority government or accept new elections.

Relations between the two countries remains ""very strong"", Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque told reporters, playing down concern that the statue could hurt relations with Japan, a major source of aid and investment.
About 1,000 Philippine women were forced into prostitution by Japanese troops during the war - they are known by the Japanese euphemism ""comfort women"" - a sensitive issue that had prompted some survivors to demand an apology as well as compensation from Tokyo.
Roque said the statue was not an issue for Duterte to get involved in.
""It's up to the people who erected the statue to do anything they want with it,"" he said. ""I don't think it is really a diplomatic issue, no."" 
The National Historical Commission of the Philippines, a government agency, allowed a foundation to erect the bronze statue in a Manila tourist spot last month.
Roque declined to comment on Japanese Internal Affairs and Communications Minister Seiko Noda expressing regret about the statue when she met Duterte on Tuesday.
In comments posted on the ministry's website, Noda said: ""I spoke frankly to the president and I believe he understood"".
Duterte and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe get along well and have visited each others' family homes. Duterte has lauded Japan for its ""preeminent and peerless role"" as a big investor and development partner.
A spokeswoman from Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was ""extremely regrettable"" that comfort women statues including the one in the Philippines had been erected.
Last year, Japan temporarily recalled its ambassador to South Korea over a statue commemorating Korean women forced to work in Japanese military brothels during World War Two.
South Korean activists estimate that there may have been as many as 200,000 Korean victims.
A Philippine women's group called Gabriela said Japan aimed ""to erase any trace of their country's brutality to the world and we should not allow them to have their way on historical revisionism"".
""It is an added insult to the comfort women in the country and the families of those who died during the Japanese occupation if this administration allows Japan to have the say in the comfort women monument issue,"" it said in a statement.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday welcomed recent progress in inter-Korean talks during a telephone call with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the South's Blue House said in a statement.
At Tuesday's talks, North Korea said it would attend the Winter Olympics in the South next month, and both sides agreed to resolve problems through dialogue and revive military consultations to avoid accidental conflict. 
Seoul and Beijing agreed in October to move beyond a year-long stand-off over the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea, a dispute that has been devastating to South Korean businesses that rely on Chinese consumers.
Moon made his first visit to China last month. 
During the 30-minute call, Xi said he supported Moon's stance that the advancement of inter-Korean ties and the denuclearisation of the peninsula should ""go in parallel"", Moon's office said. 
""The two leaders agreed to strengthen strategic communication and cooperation,"" the statement said.
It added that the two leaders hoped the latest dialogue effort would lead to a peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue and the establishment of peace on the Korean peninsula, beyond next month's Olympics. 
In Beijing, the official China Daily cited Xi as telling Moon that China wanted to work with South Korea to ""jointly maintain regional peace and stability"". 
In a telephone call on Wednesday, Moon and U.S. President Donald Trump also said the dialogue ""could naturally lead to talks between the United States and North Korea for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula after the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.""
Washington welcomed the talks as a first step towards resolving the crisis over North Korea's program to develop nuclear missiles capable of reaching the United States, but it has reiterated that any talks involving the U.S. must be aimed at the North's denuclearization.

However, Pyongyang said it would not discuss its nuclear weapons because they were aimed only at the United States and not its ""brethren"" in China, Russia and South Korea, showing that a diplomatic breakthrough to the crisis remains far off.

The Chinese frigate was seen in waters contiguous to Japan's territory around the islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, the Defence Ministry said. It did not enter Japanese territorial waters.
A foreign submarine was also detected in the same area on Wednesday as well as on Thursday, it added, without identifying the nationality. Both had left the area by Thursday afternoon.
Japan and China have long been at loggerheads over the tiny, uninhabited islands. They are controlled by Japan but claimed also by China.

Kenji Kanasugi, director-general of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau, met with Chinese ambassador Cheng Yonghua at the Foreign Ministry to express grave concern about the move, the ministry said in a statement.
The Chinese ambassador responded to the protest by reiterating China's stance on the islands, the statement added.
China routinely rejects Japanese criticism of such patrols, saying its ships have every right to operate in what China calls its territorial waters. 
China's defense ministry said in an online statement that a Chinese missile frigate had responded to two Japanese ships entering its claimed waters but that the ships had now left.

Turkey, which borders Idlib, has also called on Russia and Iran to put pressure on Damascus to halt the offensive in a corner of Syria whose population has been swollen by Syrians fleeing government offensives elsewhere.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) will still need to rule on the case -- brought by a man whose American husband was refused residence in his home country of Romania -- which could expand legal recognition of same-sex marriages across Europe. 
Advocate General Melchior Wathelet said the term ""spouse"" should include partners of the same sex when it came to the freedom of residence of EU citizens and their family members. Judges are not bound by the advocate general's view, but tend to follow it.
""Although member states are free to authorize marriage between persons of the same sex or not, they may not impede the freedom of residence of an EU citizen by refusing to grant his or her spouse of the same sex, a national of a non-EU country,"" Wathelet said in his opinion. 
The Romanian man who brought the case married an American man in 2010 in Belgium, where same-sex marriages are allowed, and then sought a residence permit for his spouse from the Romanian authorities.
They turned down the request because Romanian law prohibits same-sex marriages and does not recognize such marriages that have taken place abroad.
The couple said the decision was discriminatory and challenged it in Romanian courts. Romania's Constitutional Court asked the European Court of Justice whether the non-EU spouse should be regarded as a spouse eligible to claim a right of residence.

HANOI (Reuters) - Prosecutors in Vietnam were seeking long jail terms on Thursday for a former member of the country's ruling politburo and a high-profile former official over losses of hundreds of millions of dollars at a state oil firm, domestic media said. 
Dinh La Thang, the former politburo official and one-time chairman of PetroVietnam, faces 14 to 15 years in jail for ""deliberate violation of state regulations on economic management"", media quoted prosecutors as saying in court in Hanoi.
Thang is the most senior politician to face trial in decades. Scores of former officials and bankers have been arrested in a sweeping crackdown on corruption in the communist state whose fast-growing economy is a lure for investors.
The Supreme People's Procuracy of Vietnam sought life in prison for Trinh Xuan Thanh, the former chairman of PetroVietnam Construction, whose case grabbed world headlines last year when Germany accused Vietnam of kidnapping him from a Berlin park.
He is accused over losses of more than $150 million and prosecutors could potentially have sought a death sentence.
Thanh denied accusations by witnesses in court on Tuesday that he had handled bags of money sent to officials as bribes, the website VNexpress said.
The two are accused alongside 20 others who face charges of deliberate mismanagement, embezzlement, or both, in the most important trial of the widening crackdown on corruption. 
The crackdown intensified last year after Nguyen Phu Trong, the general secretary of the Communist Party, won a power struggle with former prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung.

Thang testified on Tuesday that the previous prime minister took a key decision that led to PetroVietnam's losses.

In Thala, near the Algerian border, troops were sent in after protesters burned down the national security building forcing police to retreat from the town, witnesses told Reuters.  
Violent anti-government protests have raged in other towns in the North African country since Monday, among them the tourist resort of Sousse, against price and tax rises imposed by government to cut a ballooning deficit and satisfy international lenders. 
While Tunisia is widely seen as the only democratic success story among ""Arab Spring"" nations, it has also had nine governments since the overthrow of authoritarian leader Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, none of which have been able to deal with growing economic problems. 
""Three hundred and thirty people involved in acts of sabotage and robbery were arrested last night,"" interior Ministry spokesman Khelifa Chibani said bringing the number of detainees since the protests began to around 600.
The army was also deployed in several other cities, including Sousse, Kebeli and Bizert to protect government buildings that have become a target for protesters.
Uprisings in 2011 and two major militant attacks in 2015 damaged foreign investment and tourism, which accounts for eight percent of Tunisia's economic activity.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 02:40AM ET</span>",Taiwan plans to invest in advanced arms as China flexes its muscles,"By Jess Macy Yu and Greg Torode
TAIPEI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Taiwan's ruling party plans to use a long-term increase in defense spending to pursue advanced weapons systems, government officials say, in what is widely seen as growing determination to forge a stronger deterrent against a Chinese attack.
The left-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), led by President Tsai Ing-wen, is working on detailed spending plans through 2025, two officials with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Tsai and her team have met repeatedly with military leaders in a push for new investment in training and equipment, one of the officials said. Immediate priorities include new missiles, drones and electronic warfare systems, fighter aircraft and ballistic missile defenses, according to a separate statement from the Ministry of National Defence sent to Reuters.
Although some arms would be domestically produced, such as an existing plan to locally build eight submarines, they say a longer-term Taiwanese drive for improved capabilities could mean fresh U.S. deals. Those requests could deepen tensions between Beijing and Washington.
China considers democratic Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.
The United States, Taiwan's sole foreign supplier of arms, has for years called on Taipei to address a worsening military imbalance across the Taiwan Strait, which has recently seen heightened tensions amid military assertiveness by China. In the first week of 2018, China sailed an aircraft carrier and other military ships through the strait on a training mission.
""If there are three weapons systems that China's high command really wants to keep out of Taiwan's hands, it is submarines, fighter jets and ballistic missile defenses. Taipei is smartly investing in all three,"" said Ian Easton, a U.S.-based research fellow at the Project 2049 Institute, which studies Asia security issues. 
In October, Tsai signaled that defense spending would increase by at least 2 percent each year, with more possible based on the need for significant purchases. 
By 2025, Taiwan's annual defense spending is projected to increase by at least 20 percent - or NT$62.4 billion ($2.08 billion) - to NT$381.7 billion, the officials said, if the legislature approves the future budgets. 
With economic growth ""on track"" for this year, Taiwan's defense spending will ""likely"" exceed the baseline that the president has announced, one of the officials said. 
""The Tsai administration is seeking to undo years of defense spending cuts,"" the two officials said in a separate written statement to Reuters.
""The additional funds will target enhancements in asymmetrical defense strategies in the short-term, and advanced weapons and equipment either domestically produced or through defense procurements in the long-term,"" one of them added. 
Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence confirmed to Reuters that electronic warfare, information security and improved drones were among the priorities for this year, along with existing programs, including upgrades of its Raytheon Co Patriot missile defenses,  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) F-16A/B jet fighters and indigenously built training planes.
The ministry also confirmed plans to improve mobile missile launchers, but has yet to detail whether that would mean reviving an earlier ballistic missile program or improving the cruise missiles Taiwan already has. Both are likely to face intense Chinese scrutiny. 
The planned increases mark a change in commitment from the previous China-friendly Kuomintang government under President Ma Ying-jeou, under whom defense spending from 2009 to 2016 slid from 3 percent to 2.1 percent of GDP, according to government data.
Regional diplomats are watching developments closely. Although few nations have formal diplomatic or military ties with the island, any boost in Taiwan's military could complicate China's strategic domain.
""The military balance is rapidly shifting in China's favor, but the new Taiwanese government is more prepared to stand up to China's behavior,"" said Singapore-based security analyst Tim Huxley. ""I think some countries, particularly Japan, will see that as a net benefit by making life more difficult for China.""
In recent months, China has ramped up its long-range air force drills, particularly around Taiwan. In March, it said its defense spending would increase 7 percent for 2017, or 1.044 trillion yuan ($158.70 billion). 
After taking office in 2016, Tsai has promoted Taiwan's domestic defense industry as one of several pillars under a so-called ""5 plus 2"" program that seeks to foster important business sectors in Taiwan. 
Analysts have said Taiwan would need to improve both asymmetric warfare and high-end capabilities like aircraft and missile defense after years of budgetary neglect. 
Asymmetric warfare means using limited resources to inflict unacceptable damage to a more powerful opponent. Taiwan is betting it can make an attack on it too painful for China to consider, according to Collin Koh, a research fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.
""The Taiwanese may not be able to overturn the balance of power now, but they can improve their abilities to raise the costs on China,"" he said.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia and China signed 19 aid and investment pacts on Thursday in the latest sign of their strengthening relationship as Cambodia turns further away from Western donors.
China is Cambodia's biggest aid donor and its backing has bolstered Hun Sen in the face of criticism over what his opponents have said amounts to his destruction of democracy ahead of an election this year.
The agreements, whose value was not disclosed, were signed after talks between China's Premier Li Keqiang and his Cambodian counterpart Hun Sen.
They included one between the Overseas Cambodia Investment Corporation and China Development Bank (CDB) for a loan for a new airport in Siem Reap province, and another deal to build a highway from Phnom Penh to the beach resort of Sihanoukville, already a hub of Chinese investment.
Cambodia's Royal Group of Companies and China Great Wall Industry Corporation agreed to launch the southeast Asian nation's first communications satellite. Other deals included soft loans for electricity supply and support for agriculture.
Li and Hun Sen also discussed how to encourage Chinese tourists to visit Cambodia and exports of sugar to China, Eang Sophalleth, an aide to Hun Sen, said.
Li told Hun Sen that China had another aid pledge of more than 1.2 billion yuan ($184 million) for other projects, Eang Sophalleth said.
Cambodia's Foreign Ministry said bilateral trade would reach $6 billion by 2020.

Shigeharu Shirai was arrested on Wednesday evening in Lopburi province, 150 km (95 miles) north of the capital, Bangkok. Police said he had confessed to being part of the Yamaguchi-gumi gang within Japan's Yakuza, but not to murder.
Shirai is accused of being one of eight gangsters involved in the murder of another gang leader in 2003. The other seven have been arrested but Shirai escaped to Thailand in 2005.
""He admitted that the victim had been bullied and there might have been plots within the Yakuza subgroups to kill him ... but he has not confessed to murdering the fellow gang leader,"" said Wirachai Songmetta, Thailand's deputy police chief.
It was not possible to contact Shirai or a representative for comment.
Police said the attention of Japanese authorities was drawn after pictures of Yakuza tattoos covering Shirai's back went viral on social media.
Shirai will be charged with illegally entering Thailand and then deported to Japan to face the murder charges, they said. 
Police have also said they would investigate other suspected Yakuza gangsters in Thailand even if they did not have an arrest warrant.
Thailand is notorious for the presence of foreign gangsters. Last month, Thai police arrested four members of a Hells Angels biker gang accused of drugs offences, violence, and posing a threat to society.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The head of the Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit, a part of the finance ministry tasked with combating and preventing money laundering, resigned on Wednesday, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
The resignation of Alberto Bazbaz comes amid a seismic shift in Mexico's political landscape ahead of a key July presidential election and follows a critical report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international organization that sets global standards for fighting illicit finance. 
The FATF's report last week criticized Mexico for failing to systematically prosecute money launderers.
Bazbaz's reasons for resigning from the position he held since 2013 were not immediately clear.
Following the FATF report, Mexico’s acting attorney general said on Thursday that prosecutors were already working to improve investigations and cooperation with other countries.
The FATF report highlighted that Mexico has been slipping in successful convictions. The country already lagged regional peers such as Colombia and Brazil, both of which have made strides in setting up independent prosecutors.

Mexico is making little headway in seizing illicit cash, according to the government's own estimates. It seized just $32.5 million in 2016, representing less than 0.1 percent of the $58.5 billion of illicit revenues the government estimates is generated by organized crime annually.

1686,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>",U.S. travel warning puts five Mexican states on par with war-torn nations,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Rampant crime and gang activity in Mexico prompted the U.S. State Department on Wednesday to issue a stringent travel advisory, warning tourists to completely avoid five Mexican states, an advisory level often reserved for nations at war.
The State Department's highest ""do not travel"" advisory places the states of Colima, Michoacan, Sinaloa, Tamaulipas and Guerrero at the same warning level as war-ravaged Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.
The advisory delivered a stark reminder of the formerly ritzy seaside resort city Acapulco fall from grace.
Once a glamorous playground for the Hollywood jet set, including Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth, the resort in Guerrero state now has one of the highest murder rates in the world, having fallen victim to vicious gang warfare in recent years.
""Armed groups operate independently of the government in many areas of Guerrero. Members of these groups frequently maintain roadblocks and may use violence toward travelers,"" said the State Department.
Overall, the State Department placed Mexico at the second of its four-stage travel advisory levels.
""Exercise increased caution in Mexico due to crime ... violent crime, such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery, is widespread,"" it said.
The advisory underscored the limitations that the U.S. government faces in providing emergency services in many areas of Mexico because U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling to those areas.
Clashes between rival drug gangs contributed to a record number of murders in Mexico last year, according to official data, dealing a fresh blow to President Enrique Pena Nieto's pledge to bring gang violence under control with presidential elections due in July 2018.
In recent months, about a dozen politicians, officials and candidates for elected office have been killed in states where there are struggles between criminal groups for the control of drug trafficking routes.

Citizens of crisis-stricken Venezuelan routinely travel to the more prosperous Curacao in search of work or staple products that are unavailable amid the collapse of Venezuela's socialist economic system. 
President Nicolas Maduro last week ordered a halt to all air and sea travel to the islands of Curacao, Bonaire and Aruba, in order to prevent smuggling of Venezuelan goods by what he called ""mafias."" 
Two women and two men were ""found on the beach this morning"" Reginald Huggins of the Curacao police told local media.
""This was not a crime, they were not murdered."" 
The boat left from the western coast of Venezuela but broke apart several miles before reaching Curacao, said a Venezuelan family member of one of the passengers on board who survived.
""An enormous wave broke the boat in two - in fact it was carrying too many passengers,"" said the family member, who asked not to be identified.
Curacao's government criticized the travel ban, saying in a statement that the ""unilateral closure of the border with Venezuela does not fit with the search for better relations with our neighbor.""

Venezuela's heavy subsidies for consumer goods, most notably fuel, have for years fueled contraband to neighboring nations. Maduro says such contraband is driving chronic product shortages, while his critics insist the country's state-led economic model is to blame.

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 08:37PM ET</span>","Column: Buy time, not stuff, for more happiness","By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - For greater happiness in 2018, take a tip from a happiness researcher: Buy time instead of more stuff.
Hiring a baby nurse for a couple of nights bought psychology professor Elizabeth Dunn quality time with her husband when they were new parents, validating results from her happiness studies at University of British Columbia.
""It was very expensive, but well worth it,"" said Dunn, who co-authored ""Happy Money: The Science of Happier Spending.""
The world suffers from a ""time famine,"" sociologists say, as people reluctantly take on unpleasant tasks even though research shows time pressures can lead to anxiety, obesity and various ailments.
Spending to free up time brings more happiness than cramming something new into the closet, Dunn found in her recent study, ""Buying Time Promotes Happiness."" Yet only 28 percent of people do it, regardless of income or country.
Perhaps hiring a housecleaner or someone to shovel snow from the driveway would make you happier. Taking a cab or a ride sharing service, rather than a bus, could change the course of a pressure-packed the day.
Dunn's wish was simply relief from sleeplessness. ""I have an intense job, a child and a marriage and I'd like to remain in all of them,"" she said.
Tasks that weigh on happiness vary by individual, but there are some common gripes. Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman's research has found the morning commute the most unpleasant part of the day for many.
TESTING HAPPINESS
About 6,000 people in the United States, Canada, Denmark and Netherlands were surveyed by Dunn and Harvard Assistant Business Professor Ashley Whillans for ""Buying Time Promotes Happiness."" Few were paying someone else to complete unenjoyable daily tasks, they found.
Each participant in Vancouver, Canada was given $40 on different days with spending instructions. When they could buy any physical item, purchases ranged from shirts to wine. On a day they had to pay for a task, the money covered housecleaning to paying someone to make a bean dip for a friend's party.
At the end of each day, individuals were clear about how they felt, said Whillans. The average happiness score for those who bought material items was 3.7. But the average rose to 4 when people saved themselves time.
Now Dunn's research has shifted focus to why people do not spend on time savers.
One roadblock is guilt about handing off responsibility, even when paying someone else to do the job. Also, advance planning is needed to hire someone to clean house or deliver groceries. When it gets too late, many people simply end up doing the job themselves, said Dunn.
People also give little thought to how they spend their money. Dunn has found that regardless of income, giving to charity or spending on an experience brings more joy than buying a material item.
The lesson: pleasure from material purchases tends to be short-lived, while memories from experiences and reduced anxiety from time constraints lasts longer.

1689,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 08:37PM ET</span>",Canada telling Salvadorans facing U.S. exit that haven isn't guaranteed,"By Anna Mehler Paperny
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada is sending a Spanish-speaking lawmaker to California to dissuade potential migrants from illegally crossing the border following Washington’s decision to end the temporary protected status of some 200,000 Salvadorans.
The trip was planned in anticipation of Monday's decision by U.S. President Donald Trump and is part of a Canadian government attempt to prevent an influx of border-crossers like the one that occurred last year after the United States said it would end the temporary protected status granted to some 50,000 Haitians following a devastating earthquake in the Caribbean nation in 2010.
Many Haitians sought asylum in Canada based on expectations that they would easily be granted refugee status, the government said, leading lawmakers to reach out to diaspora communities to dispel such misinformation.
Like the Haitians, roughly 200,000 Salvadorans already living in the United States were granted protected status in 2001 following a major earthquake in El Salvador. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Monday said the protected status would end in September 2019.
The Canadian government is ""prepared"" for a possible influx of border-crossing asylum seekers, but does not expect one, said Hursh Jaswal, spokesman for Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen.
The ministry is sending Member of Parliament Pablo Rodriguez to California next week to talk to government officials and immigration groups about how Canada's immigration and refugee system works, Jaswal said.
Rodriguez is at least the third official whom Canada has sent to the United States in recent months to dispel misinformation about winning asylum. Most recently, the immigration minister himself went to Minneapolis, which is home to the largest Somali population in the United States.
More than 18,000 asylum seekers illegally crossed the U.S. border into Canada last year to file refugee claims, almost 17,000 of whom went to the primarily French-speaking province of Quebec.
Asylum seekers cross illegally because under a U.S.-Canada agreement they will be turned back if they try to file refugee claims at formal land border crossings, because asylum seekers must file claims in the first country where they land, unless they meet certain exemptions.
Refugee status requires a claimant to convince decision-makers of a well-founded fear of persecution in his or her country of origin.
Angela Ventura, a representative of a Salvadoran-Canadian association in Windsor, Ontario, said she expects Salvadorans in the United States to move north following Monday's announcement. 
Many of them have reasonable grounds for claiming refugee status in Canada, said Toronto refugee lawyer Raoul Boulakia. ""The situation in El Salvador is extremely dangerous,"" he said.
Canada treats some claims for asylum differently than does the United States.
More than 500 Salvadorans claimed refugee status in Canada in the first nine months of last year - more than double the total for 2016 and more than any year since at least 2013, according to Immigration and Refugee Board statistics. About two-thirds of the claimants whose cases were finalized were granted refugee status.

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (Reuters) - The death toll from devastating mudslides in affluent communities along a stretch of Southern California coastline rose to 17 on Wednesday after two more bodies were recovered, the local sheriff said, and the number of people missing also climbed to 17.
The two additional fatalities were discovered as some 500 rescuers using search dogs, helicopters and thermal-imaging equipment dug through waist-deep mud for victims or survivors of the mudslides, which were triggered by a heavy downpour early on Tuesday. 
Three more people were rescued from the path of debris on Wednesday. None of the dead have been publicly identified.
""We realize that this is going to be a long and difficult journey for all of us and our community,"" Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told reporters at a late afternoon news conference.
The walls of mud that roared through foothills and valleys sandwiched between the Pacific Ocean and the sprawling Los Padres National Forest also destroyed 100 single-family homes, damaged hundreds of other buildings and injured 28 people, said Amber Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Santa Barbara County Fire Department.
A major north-south highway along the coast, U.S. Route 101, was closed in both directions and not expected to reopen until next week. 
Among the damaged properties were historic hotels and the homes of celebrities including television personality Oprah Winfrey and talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres, who both live in the upscale hillside community of Montecito, known for its natural beauty and proximity to Los Angeles.
Verdant hillsides that had provided estates with a sense of seclusion were largely denuded by last month's historic wildfires, making them vulnerable to the massive mud and debris slides that sent boulders crashing into homes, turned highways into raging rivers and shredded cars into tangles of metal. 
THE SOUND OF DESTRUCTION
One resident of Toro Canyon described being awakened before dawn Wednesday when his home began shaking and he heard sounds like those of a freight train and snapping wood.
""What they were was a bunch of trees that were being snapped by the mud and boulders and debris that were sliding down Toro Canyon,"" Jonathan Reichlen, 45, who owns an urban landscaping company, said in a phone interview. 
""I just kind of waited it out because I did not want to go down to Toro Canyon while ... the mudslide was actually going on,"" he said.
Reichlen said he had emergency food supplies and water but no hot food and was trying to figure out a way to get safely out of the canyon. 
It was the latest blow to a region still rebuilding after the wildfires.
""First we got burned out at our ranch that caught on fire and now we're flooding, so the last month has been pretty bad,"" said Charles Stoops, as he stood in front of his house, which was surrounded in mud 3 feet deep, or nearly a meter.
Officials have ordered residents in a large swath of Montecito to stay in their homes so that rescuers can better go about their work.
Helicopters were ferrying people out of the Romero Canyon neighborhood, where about 300 people were cut off after a massive debris flow blocked the road into the area. 
The mudslides closed several historic hotels, including The Four Seasons Biltmore, which had just reopened on Monday after repairing wildfire damage. The courtyard of the 90-year-old Montecito Inn, built by silent movie actor Charlie Chaplin, was filled with a thick crust of debris driven by the slides.
The disaster followed a violent rainstorm that dumped as much as 6 inches (15 cm) of water onto areas northwest of Los Angeles.
Winfrey posted videos on Instagram showing her wading through nearly knee-deep mud on her Montecito property and later inspecting the damage.
""There used to be a fence right here. That's my neighbor's house. Devastated,"" she said.
Talk-show host DeGeneres posted a picture of a mud- and debris-filled street outside her Montecito home on Twitter, saying she did not yet know the condition of the house itself.
Former tennis star Jimmy Connors said in a tweet that he and his wife, Patti, had been evacuated by helicopter on Tuesday from their home in the posh hillside community.
The number of fatalities surpassed the death toll from a California mudslide on Jan. 10, 2005, when 10 people were killed as a hillside gave way in the town of La Conchita, less than 20 miles (30 km) south of the latest disaster.

Last month's wildfires, including the Thomas Fire, which became the largest in California history, not only burned away trees, grass and shrubs that held soil in place, but also baked a waxy layer into the earth that prevents water from sinking deeply into the ground.

Assange has been holed up for more than five years in the Ecuadorean embassy in London where he was granted asylum in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over rape allegations. 
Swedish prosecutors in May dropped their investigation into the rape allegations, but British police have said Assange would still be arrested if he left the embassy.
Reuters found an entry for ""Julian Paul Assange"" in Ecuador's Civil Registry, which only includes Ecuadorean citizens. A spokeswoman for the registry declined to comment when asked if Assange had been granted citizenship.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Bangladeshi man accused of attempting a suicide bombing in a busy New York City commuter hub in the name of Islamic State in December was indicted on U.S. terrorism charges by a grand jury on Wednesday.
Akayed Ullah, 27, faces charges that include supporting a foreign terrorist organization, using a weapon of mass destruction and carrying out a terrorist attack against a mass transit system, according to an indictment filed in federal court in Manhattan. He faces life in prison if convicted.
Ullah was previously charged in a criminal complaint filed by prosecutors shortly after his arrest last month. His court-appointed lawyer, Amy Gallicchio, could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday.
According to prosecutors, Ullah attempted to detonate a pipe bomb secured to his body in a pedestrian tunnel in the subway station in Manhattan's Times Square (NYSE:SQ) that is connected to the sprawling Port Authority Bus Terminal on the morning of Dec. 11. 
Ullah was hospitalized for injuries suffered after the bomb ignited but failed to detonate as intended, while three other people suffered minor injuries, according to prosecutors.
Ullah told police officers after the blast that he ""did it for the Islamic State,"" according to the criminal complaint.
Prosecutors said that Ullah, who has lived in the United States since 2011, began his self-radicalization in 2014 when he started viewing pro-Islamic State materials online. Inside Ullah's passport, which was recovered from his home, was a handwritten note that read, “O AMERICA, DIE IN YOUR RAGE,” according to the complaint.

Monirul Islam, head of the Bangladesh police’s counterterrorism unit, told Reuters shortly after the attack in December that his country had found no evidence linking Ullah to militants in his home country.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chileans protesting Pope Francis's 2015 appointment of a Roman Catholic bishop accused of protecting an alleged pedophile threaten to cast a shadow over the pontiff's visit to South America next week.
Parishioners in Osorno, a small city 800 kilometers (497 miles) south of the Chilean capital, say Vatican representatives denied their requests to meet with Francis. They plan to protest every day of the Pope's Jan. 15 - 18 stay in Chile.
Pope Francis, who hails from neighboring Argentina and once briefly lived in Chile, has defended Osorno Bishop Juan Barros and says allegations that he covered up abuses by one of Chile's most notorious sexual predators were unfounded. 
Planned demonstrations in Chile, a staunchly Catholic country, have rekindled accusations Francis has not done enough to root out sexual abuse in the Church, especially holding bishops accountable for covering up or mishandling sexual abuse. 
""We believe the victims of sexual abuse have been marginalized (by the Church),"" said Juan Carlos Claret, a spokesman for Osorno parishioners. ""It's a reality that we in Osorno have been living with for almost four years and we plan to keep the issue alive.""
Protests will kick off during the Pope's public appearances in the Chilean capital on Tuesday, dimming the gleam of the first leg of his return to Latin America, where he is especially popular. The trip will also take him to neighboring Peru.
""This is an otherwise remarkable pope who has obviously done a tremendous amount of good in the Catholic Church. But when it comes to the issue of child sexual abuse, he is as recalcitrant as any old-school bishop,"" said Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of Boston-based research group BishopAccountability.org.
A database compiled by the group and published on its website Wednesday lists nearly 70 Chilean priests, deacons, religious bothers and a nun who have been accused of molesting children, including some that remain in active ministry.
While other groups are likely to protest during the Pope's trip, particularly indigenous Mapuche in central Chile who criticize the church for visiting ancestral lands they say were confiscated, the Osorno critique and the focus on sexual abuse is lobbied directly at Francis.
In 2015, the Pope inflamed tensions and shocked even his many admirers, when he told a group of tourists at St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) in Vatican City that the community of Osorno ""suffered for being dumb."" He said the accusations against Barros had been cooked up by leftists.
'BETRAYED BY THE CHURCH'
The accused priest, Father Fernando Karadima, has denied allegations of abuse and the bishop said he was unaware of any wrongdoing.
A 2011 Vatican investigation found Karadima guilty of abusing teenage boys over many years and ordered him to retire to a ""life of prayer and penitence."" 
Barros has long drawn suspicions from many Chileans because of his close links with Karadima. Both were members of a priestly society in Santiago and Karadima served as Barros' mentor during the bishop's youth. 
At least one of Karadima's alleged victims has said that Barros was present during the sexual abuse.
Claret said Barros, who continues to serve as Bishop in Osorno, surrounded by volcanoes and lakes in a remote region of northern Patagonia, has divided the community and made healing for abuse victims impossible.
""Within our group, there are victims of sexual abuse. They feel betrayed by the Church,"" Claret said.
Claret said that his group had sold empanadas, a traditional Chilean pastry, since August to help pay for as many as 30 parishioners to go to the Santiago protests.
For Doyle, who plans to attend the demonstrations, the Chile situation is unique in the context of the global sexual abuse crisis that enveloped the Church for nearly two decades.

""I have never seen a reaction as powerful and anguished as the people of Osorno against this bishop,"" she said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The United States is the largest source of guns entering Brazil that end up in the hands of armed bandits and drug traffickers, according to a Brazilian Federal Police report seen by Reuters.
Roughly 1,500 guns originated in the United States out of a study of more than 10,000 arms seized by police since 2014, mostly in Rio de Janeiro, the December 2017 report said, although the guns often traveled through a third country before arriving in Brazil.
Guns from the United States tended to be assault rifles and higher caliber handguns, while guns already circulating in Brazil or arriving from other countries skewed toward smaller handguns.
""The US continues to be the largest indirect source of illegal handguns and assault rifles as a result of unrestricted sales in stores and fairs in American cities,"" the report said.
Violence fueled by illegal guns has spiked in Brazil as a deep recession from 2015 to 2017 led to funding cuts for many police forces around the country. The federal government sent troops to Rio de Janeiro and other areas last year to quell violence generally related to the drug trade.
The report calls for international bodies such as the United Nations and the Mercosur trade bloc to offer more support to stop illegal arms trafficking, as well as for more bilateral agreements such as a 2006 deal between Brazil and Paraguay to cooperate in combating the arms trade. 
Eight foreign stores are named selling the most high caliber guns that ended up in Brazil, with five located in Florida, although a store in Paraguay was the largest individual seller.
Guns from the United States generally enter Brazil through direct shipments of assembled weapons, shipments of gun parts or indirect shipments through a third country, with Paraguay being the top intermediary.
Outside the military, Brazilians can legally own guns only if they meet a series of stiff checks and even then can buy only small caliber weapons. In these instances, guns are allowed for rural residents who need them for daily subsistence, hunters and those who can prove they need a gun for self-defense.
While laws on gun purchases in the United States vary from state to state and also depend on the type of weapon being sold, it can be a fairly simple process to buy a gun, or to acquire one that was legally sold to another person.
While the overwhelming majority of guns entered over land, the report detailed an instance of 22 assault rifles sent to Brazil in a shipment of furniture, having been sewn into mattresses, with most ending up in Sao Paulo and Rio.
In another incident, 60 assault rifles that originated in Miami were discovered inside pool heaters in a cargo shipment at a Rio airport.

The entry of high caliber arms into the country is associated with gangs carrying out robberies of banks, ATMs and armored cars as the criminals want to guarantee they will have superior fire power in a confrontation with the police or armed guards, according to the report.

WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday after the first intra-Korean talks in over two years that the United States was willing to speak to North Korea ""under the right circumstances,"" although it was far from clear whether this would pay dividends.
South Korea said Trump had also said in a phone call with its President Moon Jae-in that there would be no military action while North-South talks were going on and that a Wall Street Journal article saying he was contemplating a military strike against North Korea was ""completely wrong.” 
""Who knows where it leads?"" Trump told reporters at the White House after his call with Moon to discuss Tuesday's North-South talks, the first since 2015.
He said Moon told him the talks went well, and added: ""Hopefully it will lead to success for the world, not just for our country, but for the world. And we'll be seeing over the next number of weeks and months what happens.""
South Korea's Presidential Blue House said both men had said the dialogue ""could naturally lead to talks between the United States and North Korea for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula after the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.""
At Tuesday's intra-Korea talks, North Korea said it would attend the Olympics, which South Korea will host next month, while both sides agreed to resolve problems between them through dialogue and to revive military consultations to avoid accidental conflict.
However, Pyongyang said it would not discuss its nuclear weapons because they were aimed only at the United States and not its ""brethren"" in South Korea, or Russia or China, showing that a diplomatic breakthrough to the crisis remained far off.
While Washington has welcomed the talks as a first step toward solving the crisis over North Korea's program to develop nuclear missiles capable of reaching the United States, it has reiterated that any talks involving the United States must be aimed at North Korea's denuclearization.
The White House said Trump told Moon the United States was willing to talk to North Korea ""at the appropriate time and under the right circumstances.""
Trump, who has swung between hurling insults and threats at North Korea to expressing a willingness to talk, said on Saturday he would be willing to speak to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, though not without pre-conditions.
An unsourced article in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday said U.S. officials were debating whether it was possible to mount a limited military strike against North Korea without igniting an all-out war.
The Trump administration has said it prefers a diplomatic solution, but that all options are on the table, including military ones.
U.S. officials say Trump has been considering a number of military options, including a preemptive strike on a missile or nuclear facility, but officials and analysts have warned of the risks of triggering a catastrophic wider conflict.

MOON CREDITS TRUMP FOR TALKS
Earlier on Tuesday, Moon made a point of crediting Trump for the Korean talks and also said he himself was open to meeting with Kim at any time if conditions were right and ""certain achievements are guaranteed"".
""The purpose of it shouldn’t be talks for the sake of talks,"" he told a news conference, while warning that Pyongyang would face stronger sanctions if ""provocations"" continued.
North Korea ramped up missile launches last year and conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, prompting a U.S.-led campaign to impose some of the strongest international sanctions yet, which Pyongyang dubbed an ""act of war"".
Trump and Kim have exchanged threats and insults over the past year, raising fears of war. South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with the North after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.
Washington and Seoul opened the way for the talks last week when they announced the postponement of joint military exercises that Pyongyang has denounced as a rehearsal for invasion. 
Washington had raised concerns that a New Year overture from Kim that led to the talks could be aimed at driving a wedge between the allies, but Moon said he and Washington did not differ over how to respond to North Korean threats.
""This initial round of talks is for the improvement of relations between North and South Korea. Our task ... is to draw North Korea to talks aimed at the denuclearization of the North,"" he said. ""(It's) our basic stance that will never be given up.""
North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper said all problems would be resolved through the efforts of the Korean people alone.
""If the North and South abandon external forces and cooperate together, we will be able to fully solve all problems to match our people's needs and our joint prosperity,"" it said.
In spite of the hopeful words about the potential for future talks, the U.S. intelligence assessment of North Korea’s weapons programs has not altered, officials say.
U.S. officials familiar with the classified analysis say the consensus is that Kim remains convinced that the United States is determined to overthrow him and that only a nuclear arsenal that threatens America can deter that.
One official said the North-South talks were likely to follow the pattern of past diplomatic efforts, in which North Korea has benefited from aid without making concessions.
Lee Woo-young, a professor at Seoul's University of North Korean Studies, said it was wise of Moon to praise Trump.
""By doing that, he can help the U.S. build logic for moving toward negotiations,"" he said.
The United States and Canada are due to host a conference of about 20 foreign ministers next week in Vancouver to discuss North Korea, without the participation of China, Pyongyang's sole major ally and biggest trade partner.
China would not attend and was resolutely opposed to it, its foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said.

""It will only create divisions within the international community and harm joint efforts to appropriately resolve the Korean peninsula nuclear issue,"" he said.
