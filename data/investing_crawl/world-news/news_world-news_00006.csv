CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison publicly apologised for raising an unsubstantiated allegation of harassment at a media company as he defended his handling of a scandal over the treatment of women in politics and his party.
At a media conference on Tuesday, Morrison had said he would drive cultural change amid mounting public dissatisfaction over a series of allegations about the mistreatment of women, and conceded there had been unhappiness with his handling of the issue. 
But during the event, he became involved in a terse exchange with a journalist from News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA)'s Sky News and claimed the company was investigating a harassment complaint made by a female staffer.
News Corp Australasia's executive chairman, Michael Miller, rejected the claim outright. Newspapers of the media group, which are generally supportive of the conservative government, ran front pages criticising the Prime Minister on Wednesday.
""I accept their account. I was wrong to raise it, the emotion of the moment is no excuse,"" Morrison wrote in a post to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) late on Tuesday.
The fracas derailed Morrison's attempt to repair his standing with voters, in particular women who have been angered by how the alleged rape of a young government staffer by another government staff member seemed to been initially seen as a more of political problem than a potential criminal case.
""Voters admire when leaders recognise a failure and apologise,"" said Haydon Manning, a political science professor at Flinders University in South Australia.
""This false accusation, however, undermines what he was trying to achieve.""
The issue of gender inequality spurred tens of thousands of people to rally around Australia last week and led to a slump in Morrison's standing in opinion polls. Morrison drew flak for declining to meet the protestors outside Parliament House.
Morrison has said he will announce a series of measures to improve gender equality in politics in the coming weeks, and hinted he may now back quotas on female candidates for his Liberal Party at the next election, due by mid-2022.

Female lawmakers make up less than a third of Morrison's ruling Liberal party, in contrast to the near 50% representation in the opposition Labor party.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to secure a solid parliamentary majority in Israel's election on Tuesday but a potential deal with a rival rightist could make him the eventual winner, TV exit polls showed.
Not even a campaign in which Netanyahu showcased Israel's world-beating COVID-19 vaccination rollout could break through two years of political deadlock underscored by four elections.
Israel's centre-left made a better showing than expected, according to the exit polls, after highlighting longstanding corruption allegations against Netanyahu and accusing him of mishandling the pandemic.
But like Netanyahu's traditional bloc of right-wing and Jewish religious parties, it also came up short of a governing majority in the 120-member parliament.
The stalemate could herald lengthy coalition-building talks or even a fifth election.
On social media, Netanyahu, 71, claimed ""a huge victory"" for the right-wing and his Likud party. But the TV projections did not bear that out.
The political survival of Israel's longest-serving leader appeared to rest with 48-year-old Naftali Bennett, a defence minister in a previous Netanyahu government and leader of the nationalist Yamina party.
A former Netanyahu aide who has long sought to replace him at the helm, Bennett remained noncommittal about his intentions immediately after polling stations closed.
""I will do only what is good for the state of Israel,"" Bennett was quoted as saying by a spokesman. 
Bennett, a high-tech millionaire, has said he would not serve under the centre-left group's most likely leader, 57-year-old Yair Lapid, head of the Yesh Atid party. He also gave no firm public promise during the campaign to join up with Netanyahu, for what exit polls indicated would be only a slim majority.
After the exit polls were broadcast, Bennett said he received a telephone call from Netanyahu and told him, ""we will await the final results"" before deciding on his next political steps.
Netanyahu also phoned conservative political allies and urged them to join a ""strong, stable right-wing government"", a spokesman said.
Netanyahu had campaigned on his leadership credentials based on a programme that has enabled nearly 50% of Israelis to receive two vaccine shots already.
But charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, which Netanyahu has denied in his ongoing trial, as well as economic strife Israelis suffered during three nationwide coronavirus lockdowns have weighed on his popularity.
DIVISIONS
Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a non-partisan think tank, said the exit polls showed the country remained divided and that a fifth national ballot remained a real option.
""At the same time, if Bennett joins his coalition, Netanyahu is closer than ever to a narrow government including the most extreme elements of Israeli society,"" Plesner said.
According to the exit polls, Lapid's Yesh Atid took second place with 16-18 parliamentary seats to 31-32 for top finisher Likud.
The dominant political figure of his generation, Netanyahu has been in power continuously since 2009. But the Israeli electorate is deeply polarised, with supporters hailing him as “King Bibi” and opponents holding up placards calling him “Crime Minister”.

Israel’s swift vaccine drive allowed it to reopen much of its economy before the election, and Netanyahu had promised voters and businesses more cash stipends and millions more doses of vaccine.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian authorities issued fresh flood evacuation orders for parts of the east coast on Wednesday, and warned that water levels would keep rising in some areas, even as Sydney woke up to clear skies for the first time in several days.
Wild weather systems have drenched the country's east, prompting tens of thousands of evacuations, especially in the hardest hit state of New South Wales (NSW) where dams continue to overflow and rivers bulge.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said 6,000 more people were evacuated in the last 24 hours and that new evacuation orders had been issued for residents in Sydney's western regions to move to safe zones.
""What we still have to be aware of is the fact that thousands and thousands of people are still on evacuation warnings, that the rivers will continue to swell, that catchments will continue to experience flows of water not seen in 50 years and in some places 100 years,"" Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney. 
The Insurance Council of Australia, the peak industry body, said about 17,000 damages claims worth around A$254.2 million had been lodged by Wednesday morning across NSW and Queensland.
No deaths linked to the floods have been reported but the destruction is far-reaching and more than 40,000 people in the state have been evacuated so far. 
Homes have been submerged, livestock swept away and crops drowned on a large scale. There have also been many animal rescues, with water craft used to move dogs, cattle, and even an emu, away from the flood waters.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday that heavy-load helicopters would be prepared to transport food to supermarkets where supplies were running short.
Officials told Reuters that the Warragamba Dam, the major water supply for Sydney, would continue to spill over the next several days, although at a slowing rate.
""We are seeing a reduction and given the fact that rains have passed and inflows declining we anticipate that spill should cease in the coming days,"" Water NSW spokesman Tony Webber told Reuters.
Forecasters said the weather system will shift to the island state of Tasmania on Wednesday, bringing heavy rains and localised flooding. 
Though conditions have eased, the weather bureau said water levels in rivers would not recede for several days.
""We have had phenomenal amounts of rainfall right across the state over the last week and with that rain, it's got to drain into the rivers,"" bureau official Victoria Dodds said in a televised news briefing. 
Several hundred Australian Defence Force personnel will be sent to flood-affected areas in the country's east over the next few days to help in the recovery, Australia's Emergency Management minister David Littleproud said on Wednesday.
""Their job will be out there cleaning up, making sure that we get rid of the debris, having boots on the ground,"" Littleproud said.

(Reuters) -Two days before police say Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa armed himself with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle and a handgun and donned a tactical vest, he sat in his Arvada, Colorado, home fiddling with a gun.
The sight alarmed his family. The gun did not look like a rifle featured in old Western movies, Alissa's sister-in-law told police, according to an arrest affidavit. Rather, it looked like a ""machine gun.""
Alissa said a bullet had become stuck. The family took it away from him, upset he was playing with a gun in the house.
On Monday, police said, the 21-year-old man stormed a King Soopers supermarket in Boulder and killed 10 people with a spray of bullets.
Little is known about Alissa or what may have motivated him to open fire at the store. The 10 victims ranged in age from 20 to 65 and included Eric Talley, an 11-year veteran of the Boulder police force.
According to the court affidavit, Alissa purchased a Ruger AR-556 semi-automatic pistol - a weapon that resembles a semi-automatic rifle and has a 30-round capacity - on March 16, six days before the shooting.
His sister-in-law, whose name was redacted from the court document, told investigators that she believed the gun his family had taken from Alissa was back in his room as of Monday night.
Alissa, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Syria who graduated from Arvada West High School in 2018, faced a court summons for third-degree assault after punching a classmate in the face multiple times in November 2017, according to an incident report released on Tuesday by the Arvada Police Department.
The classmate said the attack was unprovoked and without warning, an account supported by interviews with several witnesses quoted in the police report.
Alissa told the investigating officer the classmate had previously called him a ""terrorist"" and other racist names and had taken a video of him in the classroom and posted it online, making him angry. 
The police department did not release a record of how the case was resolved. 
It was not immediately clear if Alissa had a lawyer in his current case, and family members did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment.
Ali Aliwi Alissa, the suspect's 34-year-old brother, told The Daily Beast that Alissa was antisocial and paranoid, and had talked at times in high school about ""being chased"" or said someone was looking for him.

Records from Arvada West High School show he was on the wrestling team during two seasons through his graduating year, according to Cameron Bell, a spokeswoman for the school district.
Alissa, who was treated for a leg wound suffered in an exchange of gunfire with responding police, is in jail awaiting an initial court appearance on murder and other charges. Authorities said they were confident he acted alone.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un broke ground for 10,000 new apartments in the capital city of Pyongyang, state media reported on Wednesday, despite economic crises that have left other signature construction projects stalled.
Kim attended a ceremony on Tuesday to inaugurate the start of construction on the first phase of a project to eventually build 50,000 new apartments, part of a five-year plan announced in January. 
""Nothing is more worthwhile and honourable and happier than to unhesitatingly dedicate our sweat and passion to building an ideal street ... "" Kim said, according to state news agency KCNA.
The government decided to push ahead with the project because it wants to improve living conditions for citizens, he said.
Kim’s ambitious new plan for the next five years is aimed at developing North Korea’s economy, but the proposals may falter in the face of major challenges, including international sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
North Korea fired two short-range missiles at the weekend, U.S. officials said on Tuesday, but Washington played down the first such tests since Joe Biden became president and said it was still open to dialogue with Pyongyang.
Government mismanagement, natural disasters, and a border lockdown to prevent a coronavirus outbreak have further hobbled the country's economy, with the United Nations warning of possible food shortages and other humanitarian disasters.
""It is risky for Kim Jong Un to kick-off another high-profile construction project when other keynote state projects are so badly delayed,"" said Chad O'Carroll, CEO of Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea.
But the launch of the project may signal that an end to North Korea's strict COVID-19 border closure is finally in the cards, he said.

""Some construction inputs from overseas will be required for these new apartments, which will only be possible to acquire if the North starts allowing imports again,"" O'Carroll said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico and the United States discussed ways to protect migrants on Tuesday, officials said, even as Mexico's human rights watchdog flagged risks to a new militarized drive to deter Central Americans from entering its territory.
U.S. President Joe Biden sent envoys https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2LK1LK, including his border coordinator Roberta Jacobson, to Mexico to discuss how to tackle a recent jump in migrant arrivals at the U.S. border that have put the new Democratic administration under mounting pressure.
Led for Mexico by Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, the talks highlighted ""humanitarian actions"" to promote economic development in Central America to mitigate the root causes of migration, the Mexican foreign ministry said in a statement.
U.S. officials are struggling to house and process an increasing number of unaccompanied children, many of whom have been stuck in jail-like border stations https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2BF2PK for days while they await placement in overwhelmed government-run shelters.
Ebrard said after the meeting that talks would be ongoing, and ultimately aimed to agree on measures that would allow people from Central America and southern Mexico to have a ""different future"" that would remove the need to migrate.
Officials also discussed different mechanisms for ""orderly and safe"" migration, and the protection of human rights, particularly those of children, his ministry said.
While those discussions were underway, Mexico has also been stepping up operations led by militarized police and soldiers in the south of the country aimed at deterring thousands of Central Americans coming north as they attempt to escape recession, violence and the effects of devastating hurricanes.
Mexico's national human rights commission (CNDH) has demanded the rights of migrants be respected during the new enforcement push, in which security forces are employing drones and night vision goggles to catch people entering the country.
In a statement Tuesday, the CNDH said it would ensure the actions of the authorities strictly adhere to legal norms.
There was no immediate comment from the White House on the outcome of the discussions with Mexico. Further U.S. talks on migration are due to take place in Guatemala.
U.S. envoy Jacobson later released a statement calling on migrants not to head for the United States.
""I know that many migrants may be enduring pain and hardships, but I must emphasize that the United States border is closed. Don't take the dangerous journey,"" Jacobson said. 
Earlier, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador again urged Washington to help spur development in Central America.
""People don't go to the United States for fun, they go out of necessity,"" Lopez Obrador told a news conference.
For years, the bulk of people seeking to cross illegally into the United States have come from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and the poorer regions of southern Mexico. 
The U.S. government said on Monday it would work with Mexico and Central America to mitigate the causes of migration.
Jacobson was joined by Juan Gonzalez, the National Security Council's senior director for the Western Hemisphere, and Ricardo Zuniga, the first U.S. special envoy for Central America since the Cold War-era conflicts of the 1980s. 
Biden has vowed to adopt a more humanitarian policy towards migrants than his Republican predecessor Donald Trump.

Mexico has welcomed Biden's efforts, but says the change in policy has also encouraged people to think that it is now easier to enter the United States.

7,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 09:42PM ET</span>",Netanyahu's future unclear as exit polls forecast stalemate in Israel's election,"By Jeffrey Heller and Stephen Farrell
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's prospects for retaining power were uncertain on Wednesday after exit polls in Israel's fourth national election in two years projected yet another stalemate.
With final results not due until later in the week, the forecasts indicated that even Netanyahu's stewardship of a world-beating COVID-19 vaccination rollout - a showcase of his campaign - may not have been enough to propel him to victory.
Initial projections by Israel's three main TV channels after Tuesday's voting gave Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud party, an edge, based on the potential support of an ultranationalist rival, Naftali Bennett, once his defence minister.
But amended forecasts indicated deadlock even with Bennett's prospective backing, with a parliament divided equally between Netanyahu's likely opponents and supporters.
Israel's opposition made a better showing than expected, and support for Likud dipped, exit polls showed, after Netanyahu's critics highlighted corruption charges against the country's longest-serving leader and accused him of mishandling the pandemic.
On social media, Netanyahu claimed a ""huge victory"" over the group of left-wing, centre and rightist parties trying to unseat him - even as the TV projections failed to bear that out.
He did not repeat the claim in an election night speech at a Likud rally, saying only that its projected number of seats in parliament, around 30, was ""a great achievement"" - it took 36 in the previous election - and that he hoped to form a ""stable right-wing government"".
Unless coalition-building talks, which have followed every election Israel has held since its creation in 1948, break a stalemate, a fifth national ballot could ensue.
Bennett's far-right Yamina party was forecast to win seven seats in the 120-member legislature.
Whether he could tip the balance will depend on final results. Bennett, seemingly a natural partner for Netanyahu, said he would wait until they were in before announcing any political moves.
An alliance between Bennett, 48, who favours annexing parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and Netanyahu's opponents to the left seemed to be a political stretch.
During the campaign, Bennett said he would not serve under an anti-Netanyahu bloc's most likely leader, 57-year-old Yair Lapid, head of the Yesh Atid party.
According to the exit polls, Yesh Atid took second place with 17 to 18 parliamentary seats, versus 30 to 31 for top finisher Likud.
A Netanyahu government with Bennett and a clutch of other ultranationalists on board would result in one of the most right-wing governments in Israel's history.
It would likely be at loggerheads with the administration of U.S. Democratic President Joe Biden over issues such as Palestinian statehood and engagement by Washington with Israel's arch-enemy Iran over Tehran's nuclear programme.
VACCINATIONS
Netanyahu had campaigned on his leadership credentials based on a drive that has enabled nearly 50% of Israelis to receive two vaccine shots already.
But charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, which Netanyahu has denied in an ongoing corruption trial, as well as economic strife Israelis suffered during three nationwide coronavirus lockdowns, have weighed on his popularity.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden urged Congress to swiftly pass gun control laws and may take action on his own to stop mass violence, the White House said on Tuesday, a day after the second deadly mass shooting in a week.
The Democrat called on the Senate to approve two bills passed by the House of Representatives on March 11 that would broaden background checks on gun buyers. He also called for a ban on assault-style weapons.
""I don't need to wait another minute - let alone an hour - to take common-sense steps that will save the lives in the future, and I urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to act,"" Biden said at the White House on Tuesday.
Spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters Biden is ""considering a range"" of executive actions to try to stop gun violence. Such actions do not require the approval of Congress.
Biden, who took office in January, pledged during his presidential campaign to enact gun safety measures, but has devoted the first months to distributing coronavirus stimulus and vaccines.
On Monday, a gunman killed 10 in a Colorado supermarket, just six days after eight people were shot and killed at Atlanta-area day spas. The two shootings put renewed pressure on Biden to act on his promise.
The United States has the world's highest rate of civilian gun ownership, RAND Corp research shows, and a gun fatality rate consistently higher than other rich nations. There were more than 43,000 U.S. gun deaths last year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. 
Activists say executive actions that Biden could take right away include strengthening background checks, giving money to cities to fight gun violence, and regulating the market for ""ghost guns"" - partially assembled guns that aren't subject to the same rules as most firearms.
CONGRESSIONAL INACTION
Majority leader Chuck Schumer pledged on Tuesday that the Senate would do more than it had in the past.
""This Senate will be different. This Senate is going to debate and address the epidemic of gun violence in this country,"" the Democrat said on the chamber's floor. 
He did not give timing for any legislation, however, and noted the Senate had a lot on its agenda. He also was not definite about whether an assault weapons ban would be included. 
Dozens of shocking mass shootings in the United States over the past decade, including an elementary school attack that killed 26, have failed to spur lawmakers into action on gun control legislation, thanks in large part to opposition from congressional Republicans and the National Rifle Association. 
The right to ""bear arms,"" enshrined in the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, is cherished by many Americans.
Still, nearly 70% of Americans support adding ""strong or moderate"" federal gun restrictions, and ideas such as background checks and databases to track ownership have even greater public support, a 2019 Reuters poll found https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/reuters-ipsos-data-gun-control-2019-02-08.
Democrats hold slim majorities in the House and Senate. Most bills require 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate to move forward, a tough hurdle considering that Republicans hold 50 of those seats, with the tie-breaking vote being held by Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris.
Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a swing vote who holds near veto power over his party's Senate agenda because of its razor-thin majority, told reporters on Tuesday he does not support the House bills. Manchin and Republican Senator Pat Toomey instead favor their own bill, which would allow private sales of firearms without a background check.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also said he opposes the gun legislation passed by the House last week, but told reporters that he remains open to discussions about what kind of legislation could make progress through Congress.
""There have been deep-seated philosophical differences between Republicans and Democrats about how to deal with gun violence,"" the Republican said.
""One thing we do know for sure is that these shooters are invariably mentally incapacitated. This is a vexing problem that is extremely hard to identify in advance.""
Background checks are conducted to review a buyer's criminal and mental health history and other factors that could bar someone from buying a gun.
""The only place this issue does not have bipartisan support is in Washington, D.C., in the Senate,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, an influential gun safety group.
""We know that gun safety is a policy priority for the president and his administration, but there are executive actions that could be taken today.""

Any new gun control measures signed by Biden would almost certainly face a legal challenge that could reach the Supreme Court, whose 6-3 conservative majority is seen as sympathetic to an expansive view of gun rights.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had not been treated impartially in graft probes, strengthening his chances of running against President Jair Bolsonaro in next year's vote.
A dramatic reversal by Justice Carmen Lucia led a five-judge panel to find former judge Sergio Moro had made biased decisions in overseeing the graft probe known as Operation Car Wash, throwing out evidence that could have been used against Lula.
With his convictions annulled earlier this month and the prospect of a swift retrial now derailed, Lula has positioned himself as a strong leftist challenger to the right-wing Bolsonaro, though neither has yet to confirm their candidacy.
Lula's legal team said in a statement that ""the decision handed down today strengthens the justice system and the importance of due process.""
The Supreme Court's decision could also open a precedent for scores of other high-profile politicians and business leaders in prison to throw out the evidence against them gathered in the groundbreaking seven-year Car Wash probe.
Two weeks after he suspended voting on the case, Justice Nunes Marques cast earlier on Tuesday what appeared to be a tie-breaking vote finding that Moro had been impartial.

However, Justice Carmen Lucia, who cast her original vote on the case years ago, said recent events had changed her outlook, shifting her vote and the majority of the panel in Lula's favor.

The 1,500-acre Hellenikon airport site in the Athens riviera, where disused runways, terminals and former Olympic venues have sat abandoned for almost two decades, will eventually house shopping malls, hotels and residences under a 99-year lease with the state. 
Demolition crews began tearing down the first of hundreds of blocks that need to be removed from the site, which is three times the size of Monaco, last summer after years of delays due to red tape, political resistance and local opposition. 
The contract approved on Tuesday gives Lamda lease and ownership rights over part of the former airport, one of the last steps before the developer starts construction work. 
""There will be a metropolitan pole of global appeal which ... will showcase Athens as a tourist destination, a business hub and a spot of recreation in the wider Eastern Mediterranean region,"" Finance Minister Christos Staikouras said before the vote.
The project is expected to create 75,000 jobs and bring about 14 billion euros to state coffers over 25 years of construction, he said.
The Greek conservative government that took power in 2019 vowed to speed up the project, which is expected to help its efforts to pull the country out of a recession induced by the coronavirus pandemic following a decade-long financial crisis.

A consortium led by U.S. casino operator Mohegan Gaming & Entertainment plans to build and operate a luxury resort for 30 years on the site. That contract also needs parliament's clearance.

Since Britain completed its exit from the European Union at the end of last year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been keen to set out a new independent vision for the country, unveiling new policies on defence, foreign affairs to immigration.
In what the government calls the biggest overhaul of the asylum system in decades, the ""New Plan for Immigration"" sets out a plan to resettle refugees at urgent risk more quickly while making it more difficult for those arriving illegally.
""Under our New Plan for Immigration, if people arrive illegally, they will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive legally, and it will be harder for them to stay,"" Patel said in a statement.
""Profiteering from illegal migration to Britain will no longer be worth the risk, with new maximum life sentences for people smugglers ... I make no apology for these actions being firm, but as they will also save lives and target people smugglers, they are also undeniably fair.""
She also said those arriving after travelling through a safe country such as France would not have immediate entry into the system and that the government ""would stop the most unscrupulous abusing the system by posing as children"".

Reducing immigration was one of the promises made by the Vote Leave campaign, for which Johnson was a figurehead, during the 2016 referendum on membership of the EU, and the government has said it would toughen up its post-Brexit asylum system.

In a statement following their meeting, the quartet said that both Israel and the Palestinians need ""to refrain from unilateral actions that make a two-state solution more difficult to achieve.""
It appeared to be the first time since September 2018 that envoys from the four mediators have met. Last month, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he hoped there would be a quartet meeting in coming weeks, now that there was a new president in the White House.
The Palestinians want a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with east Jerusalem as its capital - all territory captured by Israel in 1967. Under a failed peace proposal by former U.S. President Donald Trump, Washington would have recognized Jewish settlements in occupied territory as part of Israel.
The new administration of President Joe Biden has said it supports a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians and will overturn several decisions made by Trump.
It has said it will continue to urge other countries to normalize ties with Israel, but stressed that is not a substitute for Israeli-Palestinian peace.
In what is widely seen as one of Trump's few foreign policy successes, Washington secured agreements late last year by four Arab states - the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco - to start normalizing relations with Israel.

16,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 06:30PM ET</span>","In emotional letter from jail, Bolivian ex-president Anez alleges 'abuse'","By Danny Ramos and Monica Machicao
LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's jailed former president Jeanine Anez has penned a lengthy and emotional letter to the country's citizens insisting she came to power legitimately, not in a coup as prosecutors allege, and that her rights are being violated in detention.
    The seven-page letter, posted on her Twitter profile and scrawled in blue biro on the torn-out pages of a notepad, bears Anez's name, signature and national identity number but is undated. A source close to Anez confirmed to Reuters that she had written it. 
The letter is the latest twist in a political saga that began when longtime leftist former President Evo Morales was ousted from power in 2019 after a disputed election.
Anez, then a conservative lawmaker and deputy senate leader, took the helm of a one-year interim government but was arrested two weeks ago on charges she helped foment a coup against Morales.
    In the letter, she alleges ""abusive"" treatment of her and her family by the police, who detained her in a dawn raid on March 13, and by the state, which she said has refused to provide her with proper medical treatment since she was jailed.
""This is a fight for democracy and we will keep going until the end,"" wrote Anez, vehemently denying the accusations against her.
    A government spokesman did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on Anez's allegations. A police spokesman declined to comment.
    Prosecutors accuse Anez of illegitimately seizing power after Morales resigned following the 2019 election that he won, but which international observers said was fraudulent and which triggered violent protests.
    They allege that Anez and her allies, including security force chiefs, threatened those before her in the line of succession to step aside for her to become interim president.
    In her letter, she insists that those individuals had not wanted to take responsibility for restoring stability. 
    ""Those who resigned rather than take charge of a country in flames where people were calling for civil war, were they not cowards??"" she wrote. 
    The three people in line to assume office before Anez - former Vice President Alvaro García Linera, former senate president Adriana Salvatierra, and former house of deputies president Victor Borda - did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
All three were Morales allies who resigned alongside or shortly after Morales, saying in statements at the time that they had received unspecified harassment and death threats.
    'ARMED TO THE TEETH'
    Anez said in her letter that more than 100 police officers had arrived at her home in the city of Trinidad to detain her ""armed to the teeth."" The incident had left young members of her family ""in a state of shock,"" she said. Reuters has not been to verify the details of her arrest.
    The 53-year-old, who family members say suffers from hypertension, said the state was jeopardizing her health. Last week, she fell ill and a judge ruled that she should be transferred to a hospital. That has not yet happened, according to her lawyer.
    She said she wanted to be treated by independent medics rather than those sent to the prison. ""I don't trust the government doctors,"" she wrote. 
    Anez's lawyer, Ariel Coronado, told Reuters on Tuesday that the state had agreed for a cardiologist to visit her in prison. 
    He said Anez was ""depressed.""
""The whole weight of the state is against her and that would affect anyone,"" he said. 
    Anez's administration took Bolivia in a sharply different direction to Morales and had itself leveled terrorism accusations against the leftist, detaining some members of his government. 
    At least 33 people were killed in violence that followed the election, 30 of them after Anez took office and passed a law giving security forces broad discretion in the use of force. 
    The detention of Anez and two of her ministers under the new government of President Luis Arce, a Morales ally voted into office in an October landslide, has brought criticism from human rights groups and calls from global powers for due process to be followed. 

    The Bolivian government insists it is seeking justice.

(Reuters) - A federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday criticized the U.S. Justice Department for speaking to the media about the ongoing investigation into the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by former President Donald Trump's supporters.
In an unusual court hearing, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said he was ""surprised"" by remarks prosecutor Michael Sherwin made to the CBS television program ""60 Minutes,"" and troubled by a New York Times article that cited anonymous Justice Department sources.
""I found it troubling that sources within the Department of Justice were detailing the possibility of additional charges in a pending criminal case and an ongoing criminal investigation,"" Mehta said, adding, ""this case will not be tried in the media.""
Mehta said the news coverage could undermine due process rights of defendants and that he would consider imposing a gag order if the pattern continues.
During the hearing, a Justice Department lawyer said Sherwin's interview with ""60 Minutes"" was being referred for review to an internal watchdog, who would determine if department policies were violated.
Sherwin, a career prosecutor from Miami who previously served as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District Columbia, told the program that investigators have found evidence that would likely allow the government to file sedition charges against some defendants.
“I believe the facts do support those charges. And I think that, as we go forward, more facts will support that,” Sherwin said in the interview, without specifying which defendants could face such a charge.
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the Sherwin interview or whether it is under investigation.
Hundreds have been charged with taking part in an attack that led to five deaths after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election victory.

Mehta is overseeing a case against members and associates of the far-right Oath Keepers group, who are facing particularly serious conspiracy charges.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea test-fired two short-range missiles over the weekend, U.S. officials said on Tuesday, in what one expert suggested was a relatively mild move as Pyongyang lobbies for a relaxation of sanctions over its nuclear and missile programs.
The two U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to offer details on the launches, which came after North Korea refused to engage with repeated behind-the-scenes U.S. diplomatic overtures by President Joe Biden's administration since mid-February.
The Pentagon declined comment on the test, which was first reported by the Washington Post. North Korea's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Jenny Town, director of 38 North, a U.S.-based website that tracks North Korea, said that if North Korea had conducted a missile test, the move was ""pretty mild.""
A top U.S. general last week had warned of the near-term possibility of a far more provocative move: a decision by North Korea to begin flight testing an improved design for its inter-continental ballistic missiles.
Such a move would sharply increase tension between the United States and North Korea.
""My guess is that it has more to do with the joint exercises than anything else. This kind of testing around the military exercises is pretty common,"" Town said, referring to joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises. 
The drills earlier this month unnerved Pyongyang even though they were scaled back this year to become computer-simulated drills.
A top North Korean diplomat last week said the country would never answer U.S. diplomatic overtures until Washington dropped hostile policies and called for sanctions relief.
North Korea maintained and developed its nuclear and ballistic missile programs throughout 2020 in violation of international sanctions, helping fund them with some $300 million stolen through cyber hacks, according to independent U.N. sanctions monitors. 
North Korea has been subjected to U.N. sanctions since 2006. They have been strengthened by the 15-member Security Council over the years in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Typically, China and Russia - who are Security Council veto powers along with the United States, Britain and France - have only viewed a test of a long-range missile or a nuclear weapons as a trigger for further possible U.N. sanctions.
The missile tests came just before a North Korean businessman accused by the United States of laundering money to circumvent U.S. and U.N. sanctions intended to curb his country's nuclear weapons program appeared in a U.S. court on Monday after extradition from Malaysia.

(Reuters) - For Teri Leiker, 51, the King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, Colorado, was a happy place. She worked there for some 30 years and was dating a colleague.
On Monday, she along with nine other people died when a gunman opened fire at the store in Boulder, Colorado. 
Among the victims was a motorcycle fan who was a gun rights supporter and a man who had just walked his daughter down the aisle. Another was a young repairman whose church said his Bosnian Serb parents had fled war in Bosnia in the 1990s for the United States.
The dead were remembered on Tuesday, a day after the shooting, by friends, families and colleagues in social media posts and interviews. Makeshift memorials sprung up for them around Boulder. Nationally, flags were lowered to half-staff.
Leiker's friend Lexi Knutson said her job made her happy. 
""She loved going to work and enjoyed everything about being there,"" Knutson told Reuters. ""Her boyfriend and her had been good friends and began dating in the fall of 2019. He was working yesterday too. He is alive.""
Knutson said she met Leiker in 2017 through a University of Colorado program that aims to foster friendships between students and community members with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The University of Colorado's flagship campus is near the store.
Knuston said Leiker had an intellectual disability and that she thought her job had come through a special needs work program. 
The 10 victims ranged in age from 20 to 65 and included Eric Talley, an 11-year veteran of the Boulder police force. Talley, 51, was the father of seven children and had recently been looking for a less dangerous job, according to a statement released by his father.
Denny Stong, 20, was the youngest victim.
Earlier this month, Stong asked via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that his friends honor his birthday by making a donation to the National Foundation for Gun Rights, whose website says it works ""to expand pro-gun precedents and defend gun owners.""
""I've chosen this nonprofit because their mission means a lot to me,"" he wrote. ""I hope you'll consider contributing as a way to celebrate with me."" 
On his Facebook page, Stong said he was a fan of planes, bikes and motorcycles. In a nod to coronavirus-induced lockdowns, he'd framed his profile picture with the words ""I can't stay home, I am a Grocery Store Worker.""
REFUGEES' SON, GRANDFATHER TO-BE
Neven Stanisic, 23, worked as a repairman and had been called in to fix a Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) coffee machine, said the Rev. Radovan Petrovic of the St. John the Baptist Serbian Orthodox Church in Lakewood, Colorado, who knows Stanisic's family well. 
He repaired the machine and was about to leave for another job when the shooter gunned him down in the parking lot, Petrovic reported that police recounted. His fate was decided in mere seconds, he said. 
Stanisic's Bosnian Serb parents fled war in Bosnia in the 1990s, the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two, and came to the United States as refugees, according to Petrovic. 
""They avoided one tragedy by coming here, but now this tragedy struck them,"" Petrovic said. 
Rikki Olds, 25, whose Facebook page was full of pictures of rivers, mountains and waterfalls, as well as selfies with her boyfriend, worked at the store. 
""We were kind of the silly ones always,"" former colleague Sogol Nasiri, 27, recounted.
""Working at King Soopers is really sometimes stressful, but we always had jokes, dancing around, being silly,"" said Nasiri, who met Olds when they both worked in the deli department of King Soopers in Louisville, Colorado in 2016, before Olds transferred to the Boulder location. 
Nasiri recalled an incident typical of her fun-loving personality. Olds once cut eye holes out of a box, put it over her head and danced around the store, she said. 
Kevin Mahoney's daughter, Erika, posted a photo on Twitter of the 61-year-old looking moved as he walked her down the aisle at her wedding last summer.
""My dad represents all things Love,"" Erika Mahoney wrote, noting that she is now pregnant and that she knows her dad ""wants me to be strong for his granddaughter.""

""I love you forever Dad,"" she wrote. ""You are always with me.""

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is the biggest obstacle to implementing Colombia's peace deal because of the protection afforded to rebels residing in his country, a Colombian official said on Tuesday. 
The government of Colombian President Ivan Duque has repeatedly accused Venezuela of sheltering former members of the now-demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) who reject a 2016 peace deal. 
Venezuela has denied protecting FARC dissidents and other armed groups like the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels. 
Protection of dissident groups under the command of former FARC leaders Ivan Marquez and Jesus Santrich blocks military action against them, the Colombian government says. 
""The dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has done tremendous damage to the implementation of the (peace) agreements by sheltering criminals such as Ivan Marquez, Jesus Santrich, alias El Paisa and alias Romana,"" Colombia's high commissioner for peace Miguel Ceballos told Reuters. 
The Venezuelan government was not immediately available to respond to Ceballos' comments. The country was an observer at the Havana, Cuba peace negotiations which produced the 2016 accord. 
Total combatants belonging to armed groups including FARC dissidents, the ELN and crime gangs like the Clan del Golfo, Los Caparros and Los Pelusos number around 7,000, Ceballos said. 
The government could only potentially negotiate another peace deal with the ELN, Ceballos said, as it the only one of the groups recognized as a political-motivated entity.
Some 200 individual members of other armed groups - including FARC dissidents - have surrendered in the last 11 months. 
""We have created the route for individual surrender so that people belonging to armed groups who want to take that step can do so,"" Ceballos said. 

Tenuous peace negotiations with the ELN collapsed in early 2019 after a bombing at Bogota's police academy killed more than 20 people. The group also rejects government preconditions for talks, including a unilateral cease fire.

24,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 04:40PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Afghan president, rejecting U.S. peace plan, to offer election in six months, officials say","By Hamid Shalizi
KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani will propose a new presidential election within six months under a peace plan he will put forward as a counter-offer to a U.S. proposal that he rejects, two senior government officials told Reuters.
Ghani will unveil his proposal at an international gathering in Turkey next month, signalling his refusal to accept Washington's plan for his elected government to be replaced by an interim administration, the officials said.
But he will participate only if Taliban leader Haibatullah Akhunzada, or Mullah Yaqub, the son of the militants' late founder, Mullah Omar, attends, one of the officials said.
Washington, which agreed last year to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan by May 1 after nearly two decades of war, is pressing for a peace deal to end fighting between the government and the Taliban. Talks between the Afghan sides in Qatar have stalled.
The Taliban, who ruled Afghanistan with an iron fist from 1996 to 2001, are seeking to topple the Western-backed government in Kabul and reimpose their brand of Islamist rule.
U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has been circulating a proposal which would replace the Kabul government with an interim administration. But Ghani has voiced vehement opposition to any solution that requires his government to step aside for unelected successors.
""The counterproposal which we are going to present at the Istanbul meeting would be to call for early presidential elections if the Taliban agree on a ceasefire,"" one senior government official said on condition of anonymity.
Another Afghan government official said: ""The president would never agree to step aside and any future government should be formed through democratic process, not a political deal.""
A third senior official also said Ghani's proposal would include possible early elections, although he did not specify the time frame. The third official said Ghani had already shared his road map with Khalilzad.
The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
U.S. SEEKING SUPPORT
With just weeks left before the May 1 deadline it agreed with the Taliban last year to end the longest war in U.S. history, Washington is seeking regional backing for its approach to push the Kabul government and insurgents to share power.
But diplomats and foreign officials have said it will be difficult to move forward with the U.S. plans without Ghani's support.
Ghani's national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, said in an interview released on Tuesday that the major dispute with the insurgents is over Afghanistan's political system, not power-sharing.
“We must have a rigorous and substantive negotiation with the Taliban first on defining how we are going to view our policies, domestic and foreign, and how our people will see our systems in the future,” Mohib said in the interview with the Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Institute think tank recorded on Monday.
Kabul insists that Afghanistan remain a republic, with elections for president and parliament. The Taliban have yet to renounce their aim of re-establishing the Islamist system headed by an un-elected leader that ended with the 2001 U.S.-led invasion.
During a visit to the region, which included stops in Doha and Islamabad, Khalilzad pushed for a conference to be hosted by Turkey with involvement from the United Nations next month.
The Afghan officials said that as part of Ghani's counter-proposal, his government would ask the U.N. to closely observe the new election to ensure it is accepted by all sides.
A presidential palace spokesman declined to comment.
Peace negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Qatar's capital Doha have made little progress, while violence has increased.
The Taliban have so far rejected a ceasefire and said they would not directly join an interim government.
Ghani was sworn in as president for a second five-year term in March last year after a disputed presidential election.
The new U.S. administration led by President Joe Biden is reviewing the May 1 deadline agreed under the Trump administration for the last 2,500 U.S. troops to leave Afghanistan. Biden told broadcaster ABC last week that it would be ""tough"" to meet it.

The Taliban say there will be consequences if the United States does not meet the deadline.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan received a letter of goodwill from his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on Tuesday, a Pakistani senior Cabinet minister said, as relations thaw between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars and have shared a fractious relationship since the two gained independence in 1947, and in 2019 tensions rose dramatically as they sent combat planes into each other's territory.
Asad Umar, a senior Pakistani minister, in a post on Twitter welcomed Modi's letter, calling it a ""message of goodwill"". He added that Khan had already expressed a desire for a peaceful South Asia. 
The message from Modi arrived on Pakistan's Republic Day, March 23, and follows a series of moves and statements signalling rapprochement. The two sides are holding talks on water sharing, with Pakistani officials in Delhi.
Last week, the chief of Pakistan's influential army called on the two sides to bury the past.
Last month, the militaries of both countries released a rare joint statement announcing a ceasefire along a disputed border in Kashmir, having exchanged fire hundreds of times in recent months.
Neither country's foreign office immediately responded to requests for comment on the letter.
Indian publication Times of India reported Modi's letter citing the Press Trust of India news agency.
Quoting from the letter, Pakistani newspaper Dawn said Modi had written that, ""India desires cordial relations with the people of Pakistan"" and ""for this, an environment of trust, devoid of terror and hostility, is imperative.""

Reuters was unable to independently verify the contents of the letter.

The request by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the first under President Joe Biden's administration and eyes Joint Base San Antonio and Fort Bliss, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told a news briefing. Kirby did not specify how many children might be housed at the bases.
""We have just received this request, so I don't have much more detail than that. We'll analyze it and evaluate it just like we would any other request for assistance,"" Kirby said.
HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
U.S. government envoys were to have initial talks in Mexico on Tuesday about managing the surge of migrants https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2BF2GE.
Biden, a Democrat who took office on Jan. 20, pledged to reverse many of the hard-line border policies of his Republican predecessor, former President Donald Trump. But less than two months into his presidency, he is dealing with an emerging humanitarian and political crisis.
The number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border this year is on pace to be the highest in 20 years, one of Biden's top officials said last week, a rise that includes an increase in unaccompanied children. 

The Biden administration has struggled to house the growing number of children arriving without a parent or legal guardian, which has left them stuck in jail-like border facilities for days. Republicans have blamed Biden for relaxing immigration policies, while some Democrats are concerned about conditions in facilities and why children are being held for so long.
Kirby said he believed HHS was looking at using a vacant dormitory at Joint Base San Antonio and vacant land at Fort Bliss. He did not explain how HHS would use vacant land.

28,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 03:38PM ET</span>",A family business: how and why smugglers are bringing more children to the U.S. border,"By Laura Gottesdiener
LA TECNICA, Guatemala (Reuters) - Honduran mother Alicia Cruz handed herself and her son in to border agents in Texas, then watched as unaccompanied children were separated for release from the group of migrants before adults and families, including hers, were expelled into Mexico. 
That's when she contracted a smuggler to ferry Jeffrey, 17, across the border again – alone.
""Leaving my son destroyed me,"" Cruz said this month, speaking from the Guatemalan-Mexican border as she headed south towards Honduras. She said her son was with relatives in Texas. ""The last thing he said was 'let me go to study, work so I can help you'.""
Almost 10,000 under-18s from Central America crossed illegally from Mexico into the United States without their parents in February, nearly double the previous month's figures, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data.
The spike comes after U.S. President Joe Biden's government, citing humanitarian reasons, said in early February it would not rapidly expel unaccompanied minors, a policy shift from the previous administration.
More than any other group of migrants, these children pose a political, logistical and moral challenge for Biden, testing the administration's ability to safely process and house new arrivals fleeing poverty and violence in Central America.
Reuters spoke to over a dozen self-identified smugglers in Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador to gain insight into how and why so many unaccompanied minors are moving through the region and crossing the border alone. All requested anonymity or nicknames in order to freely discuss the illegal industry.
The story of how the children reach the United States is varied. Some, like Jeffrey, come as far as the border with their parents; others cross with friends or relatives who are not their legal guardians. 
A third group, including children as young as two years old, make the perilous journey through some of Mexico's most lawless, cartel-controlled territory in the care only of human smugglers.
CBP did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the cases detailed by the smugglers and Cruz. Reuters was not able to independently verify the events they described.
More than half the smugglers consulted said they had transported unaccompanied minors in recent weeks, moving them by bus, car, boat and even by plane, which one well-connected smuggler called his network's ""faster new method"" to bring children up from Central America. 
The trips cost thousands of dollars per child and are often financed by parents or relatives already in the United States.
Three smugglers told Reuters they have been encouraging parents to send their children alone as a result of the shift in U.S. policy.
""It's good to take advantage of the moment, because children are able to pass quickly,"" said Daniel, a Guatemalan smuggler. ""That's what we're telling everyone.""
A White House spokesperson said last month that Biden's approach was to deal with immigration ""comprehensively, fairly and humanely"" and not to expel unaccompanied children who arrive at U.S. borders.
A FAMILY BUSINESS
Many children that the U.S. government classifies as ""unaccompanied"" actually travel with other family members – cousins, uncles, or older siblings.
But some smugglers said their networks have also been organizing children-only trips in recent weeks.
Vazquez, a Mexican smuggler who said he specializes in unaccompanied children, said the youngest child he has transported in recent weeks was a 2-year-old toddler who traveled without any other family members. On his most recent trip, he transported a group of 17 children between the ages of 5 and 9 from southern Mexico across the border into Texas.
Of those 17 children, the majority of their parents were already living in the United States, and none of them were accompanied by other family members, he said. 
After moving the children across Mexico by bus, he kept them in his own home near the U.S. border, where his wife and older daughter helped care for them until it was time for him to cross them into Texas and turn them over to U.S. border agents.
""It's a family business,"" he said.
Vazquez said the cartel that controls the territory along the border in his region mandates that he and other smugglers use the migrant children as a decoy for the cartel's own drug smuggling operations.
Smugglers offer cheaper trips for families and unaccompanied children who plan to surrender themselves to U.S. border agents and ask for asylum, compared to those who seek to enter the United States undetected.
""We deliver children to immigration (agents) and immigration (agents) are responsible for delivering them to their family members in the United States,"" said Daniel.
Guatemalans make up the largest group of unaccompanied minors, CBP data shows. A second smuggler in Guatemala said that pre-existing relationships between families and smugglers in small towns often make parents more willing to send their kids alone. 
""They send their kids with someone they know, who has already transported other family members,"" he said.
He estimated about 100 children were leaving the city of Huehuetenango, Guatemala, without their parents each week in March, which he said was well above 'normal' levels.
DIRECT BY PLANE
In 2019, smugglers sped up trips to the U.S. border by transporting unaccompanied minors from Central America on express buses.
But Roberto, a smuggler who said he is linked to a powerful cartel in Ciudad Juarez, said his network is now flying minors directly from Central America to the U.S. border by plane.
He was one of three smugglers who told Reuters they are moving children, including unaccompanied minors, on private or commercial flights between Guatemala and Mexico, or between Mexican cities. 
Internal Mexican government assessments reviewed by Reuters also state that smugglers have been flying migrants directly to the northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas, or even into Houston, Texas, and Phoenix, Arizona.
Mexican immigration agents detained 95 people, including eight unaccompanied minors, for traveling without proper documentation after they arrived on two domestic commercial flights into the northern city of Monterrey on Friday. The majority were Hondurans, while there were also a handful of people from El Salvador, Cuba and Guatemala, according to Mexican immigration authorities.
CBP, the Mexican foreign ministry, and Mexico's immigration agency did not immediately respond to request for comment about smuggling via commercial flights. 
Despite the growing demand, some smugglers told Reuters that they try to steer clear of transporting children.
""It's a risk,"" said a Salvadoran smuggler who goes by the nickname El Barrenga. ""Maybe the child's been stolen, for example. It's safer if they're with their parents.""
Even Vazquez, the smuggler who specializes in children, admitted that minors bring their own challenges.

""If an adult causes problems, you can ditch them, easily,"" he said. ""But you can't abandon a child for having a temper tantrum.""

The senators asked SEIA for information on ""the extent to which the U.S. solar supply chain is currently dependent"" on polysilicon and solar ingots/wafers made in Xinjiang, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.
Polysilicon is the key raw material used to produce solar panels that generate electricity from sunlight. Most panels installed in the United States are produced in Asia.
In the letter, the senators said that the SEIA had pledged to ""protect consumers"" and that reliance on a China-based supply chain ""fails to protect consumers from inadvertently contributing to human rights abuses abroad through their choice to consume renewable energy at home.""
Dan Whitten, SEIA's vice president of public affairs, said the group shared the senators' concerns about ""the alleged use of forced labor in the solar supply chain"".
""We have called on American solar companies to completely leave the Xinjiang region by June and are working hard to develop a supply chain traceability protocol that can be used as a compliance tool to ensure the products they use are free of forced labor,"" Whitten said. 
Rubio and Merkley partnered earlier this year to reintroduce legislation that would ban all products from Xinjiang without specific approvals, and the U.S. State Department has made a determination that Chinese officials are perpetrating a genocide in Xinjiang. 

United Nations experts and rights groups estimate over a million people, mainly Uighurs and other Muslim minorities, have been detained in a vast system of camps in China's western Xinjiang region in recent years. Many former inmates have said they were subject to ideological training and abuse in the camps. China denies all accusations of abuse.

Bartolo Guerra, a tugboat captain with more than 20 years of experience at PDVSA's maritime unit, was arrested by military counterintelligence officials in the eastern city of Puerto La Cruz in May 2020. He had voiced concerns about corruption and poor work conditions, according to a union leader present at the meeting.
Guerra was released from jail and arrived home on Tuesday, according to his daughter, Yorgielys Guerra. 
""We are happy about this, but we will keep fighting for him to have full freedom,"" Yorgielys Guerra said in a telephone interview.
Opposition politicians have denounced widespread corruption at PDVSA, once the engine of the OPEC nation's economy, which is now in its seventh year of collapse. Critics accuse Maduro of using the South American country's justice system to stifle dissent. 
Neither PDVSA, Venezuela's chief prosecutor's office, nor the oil or information ministries responded to requests for comment. Maduro insists his government is committed to combating corruption, and blames U.S. sanctions on PDVSA - part of Washington's push to oust him from power - for its struggles. 
Authorities have not commented publicly on Guerra's release. 
Late last year, Venezuelan authorities arrested several oil workers' union leaders on charges of terrorism and divulging confidential information, which other union leaders characterized as a crackdown on dissent. Other union officials have fled the country for fear of arrest.
Two PDVSA managers convicted of divulging confidential information were granted house arrest earlier this year. A former oil minister and PDVSA President, Eulogio Del Pino, is in jail awaiting trial on corruption charges.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday swore in his fourth health minister since the coronavirus pandemic began last year, as the country struggles with a record-breaking surge in deaths that is overwhelming its healthcare system. 
Bolsonaro swore in cardiologist Marcelo Queiroga in a closed ceremony, the Health Ministry said in a statement. Tapped by the president on March 15, Queiroga replaces Eduardo Pazuello, an active-duty army general who has overseen most of Brazil's pandemic response. 
It remains to be seen what path Queiroga will chart as health minister. Pazuello's two predecessors both left government after clashing with Bolsonaro's views on COVID-19. The far-right president, a former army captain, is under growing pressure to take the crisis more seriously, after spending most of the year playing down the virus, sowing doubts about vaccines and fighting state and local lockdown measures, which he said hurt employment.
This month Brazil has become the latest epicenter of the global pandemic, blighted with a lumpy vaccine rollout and a nationwide patchwork of public health restrictions against an outbreak pushing the country's hospitals to the breaking point. 
Bolsonaro has gained international notoriety for his efforts to fight lockdowns, dismiss mask mandates and advocate unproven remedies such as hydroxychloroquine.
On Tuesday, he received a fresh setback when Brazil's Supreme Court refused to hear his appeal against several states' measures restricting economic activity to slow contagion, according to a document seen by Reuters.

The World Health Organization's (WHO) regional director for the Americas, Carissa Etienne, said on Tuesday that the virus is surging ""dangerously"" across Brazil, and urged all Brazilians to adopt preventive measures to stop the spread.

CANCUN, Mexico (Reuters) - Feeling he can now travel internationally without risking his life, recently-vaccinated American Brian Sheppard hopped on a plane to Mexico's top beach resort a few days ago to attend the wedding of one of his best friends.
Like other major Mexican tourist draws, Cancun's all-inclusive hotels along wide stretches of white sand beaches on the Caribbean are benefiting from the steady if uneven global march of coronavirus vaccinations as Mexico prepares for a rebound from one of the worst-ever years for its crucial tourism sector.
While the U.S. Spring Break season has so far been relatively muted in Mexico, summer bookings are seen between 48.7% and 61.5% occupancy at the main tourist destinations, up dramatically from 2020 when properties stood mostly empty, according to government estimates. 
U.S. travelers in particular are seen feeling more confident thanks to the increasing application of coronavirus vaccines.
Battered shares of Mexican hotel companies have already begun to recover as the expectation of sunnier times takes hold.
Shares of Grupo Hotelero Santa Fe, which operates properties in Mexican beach destinations including Los Cabos and Puerto Vallarta, have rebounded by more than a third since last November when they hit a record low.
FibraHotel, meanwhile, with a similar profile of hotels has fared even better, with its shares up nearly 70% since May, when they also slumped to their lowest-ever level.
The expected summertime boom is a welcome postcard for Mexico's ailing economy as tourist spending comprised nearly 9% of gross domestic product in pre-pandemic 2019.
As he finished dinner at a beachfront restaurant, Sheppard confessed he almost turned down his friend's wedding invite.
""I was gonna miss it,"" said the 38-year-old nurse from Cleveland, Ohio, even after receiving his two-shot vaccine. The jabs, he said, gave him the confidence he needed to conquer his fears. ""I'd traveled to a few places in my home state, but nowhere really far away.""
SUMMER SURGE
The results of a poll from online travel company  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) late last year showed half of U.S. residents described themselves as ""hopeful"" for travel due to the arrival of vaccines, a sentiment that spread to Mexican hoteliers.
""The situation looks a lot different now,"" said Eduardo Cruz, head of operations for Wyndham Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:WH) in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Cruz sees even more tourism dollars flowing to Mexico in the second half of this year, pointing to what he described as pent-up demand that could lead to a ""stampede of travelers."" 
Some 458.1 million vaccines doses have been administered worldwide. The United States, home to two-thirds of Mexico's foreign visitors, has provided its residents with 126.5 million doses so far, according to figures from Our World in Data, an Oxford-based research group.
A surge of tourists to Mexico's sunkissed beaches, ancient ruins and colonial-era cities is expected even as the governments of the two top sender countries still discourage such travel.
U.S. officials require all returning travelers, including citizens, to test negative for COVID-19 and recently urged them specifically to avoid going to Mexico for Spring Break holidays.
Canada's government, meanwhile, has temporarily canceled flights to Mexico. Despite that, Cancun's tourist board is expecting 300,000 visitors in March, up a third from last year.
For most of the past year, Mexican authorities imposed few obstacles to willing visitors with disposable income to spend.
That has fed concern that new coronavirus variants, so far rarely detected in Mexico, could take hold and stifle the tourism revival.
Investors sensing a buying opportunity should proceed with caution, said Brian Rodriguez, an analyst at Mexican broker Monex.

""At these levels, investing in the sector is very attractive,"" he said. ""But only if expectations are met, and that will depend on the vaccines and borders reopening.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will join a video conference of EU leaders on Thursday as both sides try to repair ties after four difficult years with former president Donald Trump.
Many European leaders watched with shock as Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate change agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, imposed tariffs on EU goods and spurned multilateral bodies that Washington had backed for decades.
""Looking forward to welcome @POTUS at this week's European Council meeting,"" European Council President Charles Michel, who chairs summits, said on Twitter.
""I have invited the President of the US to join our meeting for him to share his views on our future cooperation. Time to rebuild our transatlantic alliance.""
The last time a U.S. president addressed an EU summit was in 2009, according to an EU spokesman, although both Europe and the United States have held regular summits at NATO. 
EU leaders will meet via video conference on Thursday and Friday to discuss vaccines, Russia, Turkey and industrial policy. Biden is expected to join at 1945 GMT on Thursday, an EU spokesman said.
A White House statement said Biden ""will engage with European Union leaders about his desire to revitalise U.S.-EU relations, work together to combat the pandemic and address climate change, and deepen the world's largest trade and investment relationship."" 
Biden will also discuss China and Russia with the leaders of the 27 EU states, who have welcomed his presidency as an opportunity to reinforce EU priorities on human rights and global warming.
However, the tough U.S. stance on China, Germany's push to complete a gas pipeline with Russia and U.S. insistence that Europeans spend more on defence are still flashpoints in the relationship, diplomats say.

The killings on Sunday represented Niger's worst civilian carnage in recent memory, surpassing an attack by suspected militants in January that killed at least 100 villagers and another last week that killed at least 58. 
The scale of the violence this year has called into question claims of progress in the fight against Islamist militants by governments in West Africa's Sahel region and former colonial power France, which has 5,000 troops there to support them. 
A security source blamed Sunday's attacks, which were carried out by men on motorbikes in the remote Tahoua region near the border with Mali, on the local Islamic State affiliate. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for previous raids against security forces and French aid workers. 
Niger only finished a period of mourning for the previous attacks on Friday. 
The rising death toll appears to be the result of the Islamists inserting themselves into ethnic conflicts between rival farming and herding communities, said Harouna Abarchi, a civil society activist who leads peace initiatives in the area. 
The militants, largely drawn from the Fulani herding community, have targeted civilians in retaliation for killings of Fulanis by self-defence militias formed by the farmers. 
""It's a fragile zone that has seen inter-communal conflicts in the past,"" Abarchi said. ""They are now going after civilians, which ... could set the zone on fire."" 
The security crisis will land at the feet of President-elect Mohamed Bazoum, who takes office next week, succeeding Mahamadou Issoufou. 
Abou Oumarou, a retired colonel and former regional governor, said the repeated attacks raised questions about the military's response. 
""How is it that 200 people can move around on motorcycles and no one is aware?"" he said. ""These forces need to surround these zones so that we know when there is a massive movement."" 
The government said it is investigating the attacks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Boston Scientific Corp agreed to pay $188.7 million to settle claims by most U.S. states that it deceptively marketed its surgical mesh devices to consumers.
The settlement with 47 states and Washington, D.C. was announced on Tuesday by several state attorneys general. Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) also agreed to describe more accurately to consumers the safety and risks of using mesh.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and its Ethicon unit reached a similar $117 million multistate settlement over the devices in 2019, while Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) and Co and its CR Bard (NYSE:BCR) unit reached a $60 million accord last September.
The devices have also been the subject of widespread litigation by women against manufacturers. Lawyers for some of the plaintiffs have estimated that settlements between the industry and more than 100,000 women may reach $11 billion.
Pelvic mesh devices, also called transvaginal mesh devices, were intended to be implanted in the pelvic floor to treat the common conditions of stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, where organs shift from their normal positions.
The states accused Boston Scientific of concealing potential serious risks of using the devices, including chronic pain, urinary dysfunction and a new onset of incontinence.
""While Boston Scientific was putting income before the health of people in need of care, women were put in danger,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.
Boston Scientific said the settlement was not an admission of misconduct or liability, and was in shareholders' best interest. It set aside money for a possible settlement in 2020.
In April 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered Boston Scientific and the Danish company Coloplast A/S, the two remaining makers of transvaginal surgical mesh implants for pelvic order prolapse, to halt sales.
It said neither company demonstrated a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for their devices.

A standoff between President Michel Aoun and Saad al-Hariri, who was designated as prime minister last October, has delayed a deal on a new government as Lebanon's worst crisis in decades spirals. 
""I stressed the need to put the higher national interest first to launch drastic reforms that can restore the international community's confidence in Lebanon,"" Saudi ambassador Walid Bukhari said after meeting Aoun in his first visit to the presidential palace since 2019.
Foreign donors have said they will not bail out the state, which is drowning in debt, unless Lebanese politicians tackle graft and waste - the root causes of the collapse. 
Gulf Arab monarchies that once came to Lebanon's rescue have kept their distance, alarmed by the expanding role of the Hezbollah movement, which is backed by their arch-rival, Iran. 
Lebanon's political deadlock intensified this week in a public war of words between Aoun and Hariri, a three-time premier traditionally aligned with the Gulf monarchies.

After the Tuesday meeting with Aoun, who is a political ally of Hezbollah, the Saudi envoy said the kindgom stood by Lebanon and its sovereignty.

The Fed's new financial stability climate committee will take a macroprudential approach to the issue, identifying and finding ways to mitigate risks that could harm the financial system as a whole, Brainard said.
The panel will work with a recently established supervision climate committee that is focused on addressing so-called microprudential risks at individual banks. 
""It is increasingly clear that climate change could have important implications for the Federal Reserve in carrying out its responsibilities assigned by the Congress,"" Brainard said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Ceres 2021 climate change conference.
""Given the implications of climate change for both individual financial institutions and the financial sector as a whole, we need a framework that incorporates both microprudential and macroprudential considerations,"" she said.
The Fed's two panels form the core ""pillars"" to its new framework for addressing the economic and financial consequences of climate change, Brainard said, adding that those risks included the potential for shocks to the financial system that could ripple out to harm households, businesses and communities. 
Senate Republicans last week sent Fed Chair Jerome Powell a letter expressing concern that the Fed would use its bank supervision powers to ""further environmental policy objectives,"" going ""beyond the scope"" of the central bank's mission. 
Those Republicans said they were particularly worried about the use of climate scenario analysis, adding that the Fed lacks jurisdiction and expertise in such matters. 
Such scenario analysis, Brainard said on Tuesday, could be a ""helpful tool"" for the Fed, providing ""a structured way of uncovering the parts of the financial system where physical, transition, and other risks may have outsized effects through potential spillovers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Samantha Power, President Joe Biden's choice to lead the U.S. Agency for International Development, eased toward confirmation on Tuesday at a calm hearing where she described foreign aid as an essential tool in counteracting China.
""China is using its economic leverage and heft... often a predatory way, not only to change governing practices within countries but ... to water down international human rights commitments,"" Power told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
""It warrants urgent, immediate and well-resourced attention,"" the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said.
In the first months of Biden's presidency, his fellow Democrats and Republicans have both taken a hard line on China, repeatedly calling it the biggest security threat to the United States.
Lawmakers from both parties brought up hot-button political issues, such as an increase in migration from Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Power backed restoring programs - suspended under former Republican President Donald Trump - seeking to improve conditions in the countries and make migration less appealing.
Biden has been criticized from the left and right since he took office in January for mixed messages about whether migrants would be sent home or allowed into the United States, which critics say is one reason for a surge in arrivals.
Power said she welcomed the restoration of funding for programs to alleviate the causes of migration, such as violence and corruption.
""I think that is the right approach. It will take us some time to ramp back up, unfortunately, because some of those programs were suspended, but the infrastructure is in place,"" Power said.

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Three people including a child have been killed and 13 others injured in a bomb blast near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
The blast occurred in the town of Chaman, which is one of two major crossing points between Afghanistan and Pakistan and used by thousands of people daily.
The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast in a statement shared with Reuters.
""It was a remote-control bomb planted in a motorbike,"" Deputy Commissioner of the district Tariq Javed Mengal told Reuters, adding that the explosion was targeting a vehicle carrying a senior police officer.
Mengal said the explosion occurred as the police vehicle was passing by. A shopkeeper, a passer-by and a child were killed, and two security personnel were among the 13 others injured. 
The injured were immediately shifted to district hospital in Chaman, and nine were taken to a hospital in the provincial capital of Quetta, a police officer told Reuters. The senior police officer who was apparently the target of the blast was not injured. Security forces launched a search operation in the area after the incident. 
The bombing comes amid a sharp rise in violence by the Pakistani Taliban, a group that once used the border region to launch attacks inside Pakistan as well as host militants including al-Qaeda, operating in neighbouring Afghanistan and globally.

The group was largely in disarray after a major Pakistani military ground operation, but last year several splinter groups announced a new alliance and since then attacks on security personnel as well as civilians have risen.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has bought more than 1 million doses of Chinese Sinopharm and CanSino Biologics COVID-19 vaccines, its first purchase from any manufacturer having previously relied on donations, the government said on Tuesday.
The shots are due to be delivered this month, with talks under way for another 7 million doses from the same companies.
The country is experiencing a sharp rise in COVID-19 infections has recorded 633,741 coronavirus cases and nearly 14,000 deaths, with 3,270 infections and 72 deaths reported in the past 24 hours. 
Prime Minister Imran Khan tested positive on Saturday.
""We have purchased 1 million and 60,000 doses of Sinopharm and CanSino vaccines,"" Asad Umar, minister in charge of pandemic operations, told Reuters. ""We will be receiving the consignment before the end of March."" 
""We want them to deliver that 7 million by the end of April, but they have not confirmed this yet. They might have some supply issues,"" Umar added.
Pakistan is currently vaccinating frontline healthcare workers and citizens over the age of 60 free of charge using over 1 million Sinopharm doses donated by China.
Pakistan has so far relied on such donations and on allocations from the World Health Organisation-backed COVAX/GAVI scheme for poorer nations.
The first COVAX/GAVI batch of up to 4 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine had been due to be delivered to Pakistan this month, Umar said, adding it was delayed due to the issues the vaccine was facing worldwide.
Pakistan is aiming to vaccinate around 70 million people out of its 220 million population to reach sufficient community immunity. The country's 100 million under 18s not yet required to be vaccinated.
With 45 million due to be covered by COVAX/GAVI provisions, Umar said Pakistan would need to cater for around 25 million of the population. 
Pakistan, one of the first countries in the world to allow private imports of COVID-19 vaccines for sale on the open market, has already received a batch of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, and also expects to get a separate batch of CanSino this week for commercial sale.
Authorities expect richer Pakistanis will buy their own vaccination shots through this route, but the commercial administration of vaccines is yet to begin as the government settles pricing issues.
Transparency International has raised concerns about the private sale of vaccines in a letter to the prime minister, saying it will cause inequality and open the door to corruption. 
Authorities have proposed a price of 8,449 rupees ($54.30) per pack of two injections of Sputnik V and 4,225 ($27.15) per injection for Convidecia, which will be CanSino's trade name.
According to a mechanism approved by the government, the trade price for an imported vaccine will add 40% mark up to the landed cost, with another 15% for retailers or hospitals.

Umar said the proposed prices were being reviewed after Sputnik V's importers had some concerns, but adding he does not see it changing.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain said on Tuesday it was easing a ban on travel from Britain, three months after suspending flights for all but Spanish nationals and residents over concerns about a more contagious variant of the coronavirus first detected in the UK.
Armed with negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test results, British travellers will be allowed in Spain from March 30, the Health Ministry said - but only for imperative health, work or education reasons. 
The remaining restrictions mean Spain does not expect an immediate revival of tourism from Britain, hindered in any case by the United Kingdom's own ban on all foreign travel except for work, education or health reasons.
Since the end of December, Spain has allowed only Spaniards, Spanish residents and nationals or residents of Andorra to fly from Britain to Spain. There are similar restrictions on travel from South Africa and Brazil.
Government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero told a news conference that, while restrictions on flights from South Africa and Brazil would be extended again because of concerns over COVID-19 variants there, they would be lifted for Britain. 
The British variant of COVID-19 is now widespread in Spain and therefore importing it is no longer a pressing epidemiological concern, a government source said, adding that the South African and Brazilian variants were more of a worry.
And, regarding potential UK visitors, the source pointed to the restrictions still in place and said: ""We don't expect them to come en masse.""
A few airlines, including Iberia and Air Europa, had maintained limited direct flights between Britain and Spain.

Britain is to review its own rules in April and could possibly allow foreign travel from May 17, which would be another step towards resuming holiday travelling to Spain.

Berlin on Tuesday extended a nationwide lockdown until April 18 in an attempt to break a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping hotels and holiday apartments closed for tourists.
""It's OK to fly to Mallorca if you're tested? But you can't stay in a Bavarian holiday apartment? It's simply incomprehensible,"" said Hubert Buchwieser, a holiday apartment owner in the Bavarian town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen.
Daniel Schimmer, a manager at the town's Garmischer Hof hotel, said: ""We are frustrated, sad and disappointed that our industry is being treated this way.""
The BTW tourism association said the decision fanned fears and frustration in the industry for its future. It called for pilot projects to test how hotels and tourist regions can reopen safely. 
""People's patience is increasingly running out, and pandemic fatigue is increasingly getting to them,"" BTW secretary general Michael Rabe said.
Germans travelling abroad on holiday will need to present a negative COVID-19 test result before they return to Germany, even when returning from regions where coronavirus infection rates are not high, but they do not need to quarantine.
The no-quarantine move has been a demand from airlines hoping for a recovery starting with the Easter holidays after Germany removed several regions in Spain, including the tourist island of Mallorca, and Portugal from its list of risk areas.
German airline Lufthansa said it will work with travel industry partners to offer tests to travellers returning from Mallorca.
Easyjet will leave it up to passengers to organise their own pre-departure tests, it told daily Tagesspiegel.
German aviation association BDL welcomed the no-quarantine rule but said compulsory testing of passengers from non-risk destinations should be an exception only during the Easter holiday season. 
On Mallorca, business owners were happy with the decision, but some locals worried about tourists spreading infection.
Maria, a 68-year-old pensioner from Mallorca, said: ""How is it that we can't go to a different region (in Spain) and they can come from Germany or other countries?"" 
German tourists sunbathing on the island's sandy beaches welcomed the no-quarantine decision and said social distancing measures were enforced on Mallorca.
""We'll take the test... We are keeping our distance from other people and I think you can't really do any better,"" said Yvonne, 35, from the western German city of Dusseldorf.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic should make governments realise that defence spending cannot guarantee security for their populations and should encourage them instead to divert funds to improve health care and fight poverty, the Vatican said on Tuesday.
""The pandemic offers us a precious opportunity,"" Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's Secretary of State and number two in the Vatican hierarchy, told a webinar on disarmament.
""It (the pandemic) prompts us to question how much the huge military expenditures are really able to guarantee the security of individual populations, of how much these resources could and should be allocated to investments to other ends,"" he added.
Parolin listed them as health, social equity and poverty eradication, adding that they were ""more suited to achieving the objective of security"" than military spending.
Parolin was among around 20 Vatican officials, diplomats, academics, and religious leaders who took part in the webinar organised by the Vatican's development office and London's SOAS University.
Dan Plesch, director of the Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy at SOAS, said taxpayers around the world spend $2 trillion a year on military activity.
""The pandemic is further shaking an already unstable world, where climate chaos and war compete for the dubious honour of most perilous threat,"" said Plesch, whose centre has formulated the Strategic Concept for Removal of Arms and Proliferation (SCRAP) and proposed it to the United Nations.
Participants pointed to positive signs in disarmament, such as the extension of the U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control treaty last month and the entry into force in January of the U.N. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW).
TPNW has been signed by 86 states and ratified by 54, according to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017.

The United States, Britain, France and other nuclear powers have not signed the treaty and boycotted talks that led to it.

His closest rival, Guy Brice Parfait Kolelas, who died hours after the polls closed, received less than 8%. Kolelas was being evacuated to France to be treated for COVID-19 when he died.
Diplomats and political analysts had expected an easy victory for Sassou, 77, who has a firm grip on state institutions. 
The main opposition party boycotted the vote and two of his other main rivals were convicted of crimes after the last election in 2016.
Sassou is a former paratrooper who took power in 1979. He lost Congo's first multi-party elections in 1992 but returned to office in 1997 after a civil war. 
He changed the constitution in 2015 to extend term limits that would have barred him from standing for re-election the following year. 
Congo's economy has been in crisis since 2014 when oil prices collapsed. That caused the country's external debt, much of it owed to private oil traders like Glencore (OTC:GLNCY), to soar to over 100% of gross domestic product. 

The coronavirus pandemic and resulting drop in oil prices last year has made matters worse. The economy contracted by more than 8% last year and is expected to grow by less than 1% this year.

(Reuters) -The last member of a full jury of 12, along with three alternates, were seated on Tuesday in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer facing murder charges in the arrest and death of George Floyd last year.
Twelve jurors and two alternates had been seated since the trial began two weeks ago: six white women, two white men, three Black men, one Black woman and two multiracial women, according to court records. 
A third alternate was seated on Tuesday, a white man who said he worked as an accountant.
Chauvin, 45, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, saying he was following police training during the deadly arrest of Floyd on May 25, 2020.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill and the lawyers in the case have questioned dozens of potential jurors in court in the last two weeks to weigh their impartiality. Chauvin, wearing a suit and tie, has taken extensive notes on a yellow legal pad throughout the proceedings. 
All of those interviewed said they were aware of video showing Chauvin, who is white, with his knee on the neck of Floyd as the 46-year-old Black man begged for his life. Almost all said they had seen at least some of the footage, which sparked global protests against police brutality and racism.

The court has promised to preserve jurors' anonymity for the duration of the trial, which is taking place in a tower in downtown Minneapolis ringed by concrete barriers and barbed wire and patrolled by soldiers from the state's National Guard.
Opening arguments are due to begin on Monday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices, in a case on Tuesday testing the scope of Native American tribal police powers, leaned toward backing the authority of a tribal police officer in Montana to stop and search a non-Native American motorist on a public road on reservation land.
The justices heard arguments in a case focusing on drug-related charges brought against a man named Joshua James Cooley, who is not a Native American, after Crow tribal police officer James Saylor in 2016 found methamphetamine and firearms in his vehicle, which was parked on a roadside on reservation land.
Cooley argued that tribal police lacked jurisdiction over him as a non-Native American even though his vehicle was searched on a public road situated on reservation land. Lower courts ruled in favor of Cooley. The Supreme Court heard the federal government's appeal backing tribal authority.
Existing precedent gives tribes criminal jurisdiction over tribe members but not non-tribe members, who instead can be prosecuted by the state or the federal government. The Supreme Court will determine how that distinction governs the power of tribal police officers when interacting with non-tribe members during roadside stops.
Some justices expressed concern about public safety if tribal officers lacked power to stop and detain non-Native Americans. Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas wondered what would happen if an officer encountered a known serial killer.
Chief Justice John Roberts, another conservative, noted that under Supreme Court precedent, tribes do retain some inherent authority to oversee their affairs.
""What could threaten that more than the idea that you can't do anything about somebody within the reservation that you have good reason to believe is violating criminal law?"" Roberts asked.
'A TOUGH ONE'
Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer highlighted the difficulty for officers in determining whether someone they have stopped is a tribe member.
""You can't just look at them and see whether they are Indians or not. People look different. I think that would be a tough one to do,"" Breyer said.
One concern for the justices was how far tribal police powers extend if officers have the power to detain. Eric Feigin, representing the federal government, said it would not have to extend to arrests or any other criminal process.
Cooley, with his young son also in the vehicle, was parked by the side of the road on reservation land in the early morning hours when Saylor spotted the vehicle and stopped to check on his welfare. The officer noticed there were two rifles and a pistol in the vehicle and drug paraphernalia in plain sight, court papers showed.
Saylor, who correctly believed that Cooley was not Native American, called local and federal law enforcement to the scene. A subsequent vehicle search uncovered more than 50 grams of methamphetamine. 
Cooley was charged by the federal government with one count of possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute and one count of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime. 
Montana-based U.S. District Judge Susan Watters ruled in 2017 that evidence obtained during the encounter with the tribal officer could not be admitted. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled in favor of Cooley in 2019. Various tribes have filed court papers backing the government's appeal.
Reservations were established beginning in the 19th century after U.S. authorities expelled Native Americans from their traditional lands.
Even if the government wins, the case would return to lower courts to decide whether the search was unlawful even if the officer had the authority to conduct a search.

The Supreme Court last year issued a ruling in another important case involving Native American tribal jurisdiction. The 5-4 decision in a child-rape case extended tribal authority in Oklahoma, effectively recognizing Native American jurisdiction over a large part of the state.

""Game Changer"", unveiled last May at University Hospital Southampton, paid tribute to the frontline workers of Britain's National Health Service (NHS) in their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The black-and-white hand-painted artwork shows a boy lifting a nurse, her arm outstretched and wearing a cape, while traditional superheroes Batman and Spider-Man lie in a bin.
Through Southampton Hospitals Charity, proceeds from the sale will be used to ""fund wellbeing projects for staff and patients, and distributed to a wider community of healthcare providers both within the NHS and charitable sectors,"" Christie's said.
A reproduction of the painting will hang in the hospital, it said.
In a Christie's auction streamed live, the painting sold for a hammer price of 14.4 million pounds ($19.85 million). Added fees gave it a final price of 16.75 million pounds, a world auction record for Banksy, according to Christie's.
The painting had carried an estimate of 2.5-3.5 million pounds. 
""Banksy is an extraordinary artist who is a constant barometer of nationwide sentiment,"" Katharine Arnold, Co-Head, Post-War and Contemporary Art, Europe at Christie's, said in a statement.
""With the perfect image of a little boy playing with his superhero doll; a nurse sporting the international Red Cross, he perfectly captured the essence of this moment in time.""
David French, Interim Chief Executive Officer at University Hospital Southampton, said: ""This incredible gift will be invaluable in helping us to focus on promoting and protecting the welfare of our staff as they heal and recover from the last year."" 
The sale took place as Britons across the country on Tuesday marked one year since Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered the nation into its first lockdown.
A minute's silence was observed to remember the more than 126,000 people who have lost their lives to the virus.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Rapid COVID-19 tests that have become a key part of nations' COVID-19 detection strategies will grow less effective as more people get vaccinated, Roche diagnostics chief Thomas Schinecker said on Tuesday.
Rapid antigen tests are reasonably accurate in detecting COVID-19 infections, especially compared to the flu, since viral loads in respiratory passageways are higher, Schinecker said on an investor call. 
But that will likely change as shots are rolled out and prevent severe infections with high viral loads, he said. 

This could drive future COVID-19 testing business to more-accurate molecular, or PCR, testing. Roche has rapid antigen tests, via its South Korean partner SD Biosensor Inc, as well as its own PCR tests that compete with diagnostics from rivals including  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT). 
""If you look at flu, actually rapid antigen testing is not the preferred method because the viral load is not so high and then you actually have issues detecting, you get a lot of false negative,"" Schinecker said. ""As people get vaccinated (for COVID-19), rapid antigen testing will become less relevant simply because of the same reason.""
Once the pandemic subsides, the new coronavirus is still expected to cause infections for years to come. Schinecker expected the global PCR testing market for COVID-19 to be ""a bit bigger"" than existing annual flu testing, now in the low single-digit billions of dollars every year.

55,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 11:15AM ET</span>",AstraZeneca to publish full trial data after U.S. rebuke,"LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) will publish up-to-date results from its latest COVID-19 vaccine trial within 48 hours after U.S. health officials said the drugmaker's analysis of the shot's efficacy may not have been based on all the available data.
The rare public rebuke marks the latest setback for the vaccine which was hailed as a milestone in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic but has since been dogged by questions over its effectiveness and possible side effects.
AstraZeneca said results it published on Monday giving the shot an efficacy rate of 79% were based on an interim analysis of data through Feb. 17 and it would now ""immediately engage"" with the panel monitoring the trial to share its full analysis.
The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said on Tuesday it had reviewed the preliminary assessment of its full, or primary, analysis and found it to be consistent with the interim report.
Its shares were down 2.5% in London trading.
The U.S. National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said on Monday that the board charged with ensuring the trial's accuracy had expressed concern the company may have given an incomplete view of the shot's effectiveness.
Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID, said the whole issue was a really unfortunate unforced error.
""This is very likely a very good vaccine and this kind of thing does ... nothing but really cast some doubt about the vaccines and may contribute to the hesitancy,"" he told ""Good Morning America"" on ABC News. 
""The data really are quite good but when they put it into the press release it wasn't completely accurate,"" he said. ""We have to keep essentially trying as hard as we can to get people to understand that there are safeguards in place.""
'NEGATIVE REPORTS' 
Besides being 79% effective in stopping symptomatic illness in the trial in the United States, Chile and Peru, the data also showed the shot was 100% effective against severe or critical forms of the disease and posed no increased risk of blood clots.
The new doubts about the shot's efficacy, however, coincide with its rollout in dozens of countries and clouds the timeline for its emergency use authorization in the United States.
""This is indeed an extraordinary act. The negative reports about this vaccine do not stop, although my assessment is that it is well tolerated and safe, but clearly less effective than the two mRNA vaccines,"" Peter Kremsner, from the University Hospital in Tuebingen, Germany.
Rival vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) that use so-called mRNA technology produced efficacy rates of about 95% each, far above the 50% benchmark set by global regulators.
The panel monitoring the AstraZeneca trial, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, is organized by NIAID and its role is to provide study oversight and evaluate clinical data to ensure safe and ethical conduct of the study.
AstraZeneca's COVID-19 shot has faced questions since late last year when the drugmaker and Oxford University published data from an earlier trial with two different efficacy readings as a result of a dosing mistake.
Later analysis suggested the dosing interval rather than the amount of dose administered was responsible for the difference.
CONFIDENCE HIT
Confidence in the vaccine took a further hit this month when more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, temporarily suspended the shot after reports linked it to a rare blood clotting disorder in a very small number of people.
The European Union's drug regulator said last week it was safe but an opinion poll on Monday showed Europeans remained skeptical about its safety.
The latest trial data, which has yet to be reviewed by independent researchers, was based on 141 infections among 32,449 participants.
Analysts had noted AstraZeneca's achievement of producing strong trial data against a backdrop of more infectious variants spreading in the United States and other countries.
Stephen Evans, a pharmacoepidemiology professor at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the up-to-date data request may have to do with efficacy readings from recent cases, which may include new variants and thus lower protection rates. 
""The other vaccines may also show such reduced efficacy and we don't know by how much. It does not leave me concerned particularly unless they had found a safety issue that was being hidden, which does not appear to be the case.""
The AstraZeneca vaccine is seen as crucial in tackling the spread of COVID-19 across the globe because it is easier and cheaper to transport than rival shots.
It has been granted conditional marketing or emergency use authorization in more than 70 countries. 

Many countries are relying heavily on it to end the pandemic, and several state leaders have taken the shot to boost confidence in the vaccine including South Korea's President Moon Jae-in who received it on Tuesday.

GENEVA/NEW DELHI (Reuters) -U.N. human rights boss Michelle Bachelet received a mandate on Tuesday to collect evidence of crimes during Sri Lanka's long civil war, which ended in 2009 with the defeat of the separatist Tamil Tigers and an upsurge of civilian deaths.
The United Nations believes 80,000-100,000 people died in the 26-year conflict, in which the rebels sought to carve out a separate state for the Tamil minority. 
It has accused both sides of war crimes.
In the final months, the army pinned the Tigers into a tiny strip of northeastern coast in a ferocious offensive, where the government says the rebels kept thousands of civilians as human shields, exacerbating the death toll. 
""It is hugely significant for victims,"" said Yasmin Sooka, a rights lawyer involved in a civil prosecution against Sri Lanka's current President Gotabaya Rajapaksa for alleged war crimes, after the U.N. Human Right Council resolution. 
""It really is a recognition that at the domestic level, processes have failed and there is no real hope that victims will access justice,"" she told Reuters. 
The Geneva-based rights council adopted a resolution, spearheaded by Britain, giving Bachelet's office new staff, powers and a $2.8 million budget to look at Sri Lanka's war, with a view to future prosecutions.
The vote was 22 in favour, with 11 against including China and Pakistan, and 14 abstentions including neighbouring India.
'MESSAGE TO PERPETRATORS'
""Impunity has become more entrenched, progress in emblematic cases has stalled,"" British ambassador Julian Braithwaite said, presenting the text for a group including Canada, Germany, Malawi, Montenegro and North Macedonia.
At a press conference in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunewardena said the resolution lacked authority as more nations voted against or abstained than in favour. 
""The resolution was brought by countries supported by Western powers that want to dominate the Global South,"" he said. 
Sri Lanka's U.N. envoy, C.A. Chandraprema, called the text ""unhelpful and divisive"".
Bachelet had in January urged states to impose sanctions on former Sri Lankan military commanders, including the current army chief, suspected of links to atrocities during the latter part of the war.
Rajapaksa, who served as the country's wartime defence chief, has maintained his innocence, and the case was withdrawn after he attained immunity on becoming president in 2019.

The U.N. forum's resolution also expressed alarm at new signs of deteriorating rights in Sri Lanka. These included putting military officers in charge of civilian government functions, an erosion of judicial independence, and impunity and political obstruction of accountability for crimes.
""This resolution should send a clear message to perpetrators of past and current crimes that they cannot continue to act with impunity,"" said Hilary Power, rights group Amnesty International's representative to the United Nations in Geneva.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica secured EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its 7.2 billion euro ($8.5 billion) acquisition of GrandVision after pledging to sell more than 300 stores in three countries to address competition concerns.
Formed in 2018 from the merger of French lens manufacturer Essilor and Italian eyewear maker Luxottica, EssilorLuxottica also makes eyewear for luxury brands such as Chanel, Prada (OTC:PRDSY) and Versace.
The company is at loggerheads with Dutch retail chain GrandVision over the latter's management of the coronavirus crisis, with litigation currently before a Dutch court.
The European Commission said EssilorLuxottica pledged to sell a total of 351 stores in Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium to allay concerns that the deal may result in price hikes for frame retailers and reduce competition. 
In Belgium, the GrandOptical chain of 35 stores will be sold without the brand name, while in Italy a total of 174 stores, which includes EssilorLuxottica's VistaSi chain and 72 GrandVision stores will be put on the block.
In the Netherlands, 142 stores from the EyeWish chain will be divested.
The EU competition enforcer said the asset sales would limit the retail footprint of the merged entity and reduce its incentive to restrict competitors' access to optical frames in Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands, while creating or boosting a rival.

Britain's parliament voted in 2019 to legalise abortion in Northern Ireland, allowing terminations without restriction up to 12 weeks and with no time limit in the case of ""severe foetal impairment or fatal foetal abnormality"".
But while the regional government is allowing early medical abortion up to 10 weeks, it has not implemented the rules in full, forcing some women to travel to other parts of the United Kingdom to access terminations. 
""While there may been some inevitable delay by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland in commissioning abortion services, given the unforeseen pressures of responding to the Covid pandemic, almost a year has passed since the Abortion Regulations came into effect,"" the British government's Northern Ireland Office said in an explanatory note to the proposed legislation. 
""We have reached a point where it remains clear that the Department of Health will not move forward to make positive progress on this matter,"" the note said. 
The legislation hands Northern Ireland minister Brandon Lewis ""the power that certain public authorities take action"", giving him the power to bypass ministerial objections.
Northern Ireland's first minister, Arlene Foster, and her socially conservative Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have opposed the implementation of the new abortion rules, saying they would represent one of the most liberal abortion rules in Western Europe and lack popular support.
DUP member of parliament Jeffrey Donaldson last week described plans to implement the legislation as ""a fundamental breach of the devolution settlement"", which grants the Northern Ireland Executive responsibility for health issues.
The region's socially conservative health minister, Robin Swann, a member of the rival Ulster Unionist Party, has repeatedly voiced his opposition to implementing the new services. 
Abortion rights activists say opinion polls show Northern Ireland supportive of more liberal abortion rules and accuse the regional administration of violating womens' rights by blocking the services.
The British government says the legislation is required to uphold the country's obligations to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, which in 2018 said Northern Ireland's restrictions of abortion represented discrimination against women. 
The new legislation is a ""necessary and appropriate means of ensuring"" that recommendations from the UN body were fulfilled, the Northern Ireland Office note said.

BOULDER, Colo. (Reuters) - A suspect was in custody on Tuesday a day after 10 people, including a policeman, were killed in a hail of gunfire inside a Colorado grocery store, marking America's second mass shooting in a week and adding to the state's history of deadly massacres.
Authorities have not yet identified the man seen bloodied and limping as he was led away from the scene in handcuffs on Monday. A news briefing was scheduled for late on Tuesday morning.
The shooting at a King Soopers outlet in Boulder, about 28 miles (45 km) northwest of Denver, drew hundreds of responding officers and sent shoppers and employees fleeing for cover.
The first officer on the scene, 51-year-old Eric Talley, was among those killed, a tearful Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold said at a Monday news conference. An 11-year veteran of the force, Talley was the father of seven children and had recently been looking for a less dangerous job, according to a statement released by his father.
Authorities gave few details and offered no possible motive for the bloodshed, which came six days after a gunman went on a killing spree in the Atlanta area, fatally shooting eight people at three day spas before he was arrested.
Witnesses in Colorado described a chaotic and frightening scene inside the store.
Ryan Borowski, 37, went in looking for something to satisfy a sugar craving. He had picked out a 12-pack of soda and a bag of chips when he heard shots ring out, sending him scurrying for the store's back exit.
""It was pretty terrifying,"" he said. ""Fastest fire drill I've ever been in.""
Sarah Moonshadow, 42, was at the checkout line with her adult son, Nicholas, when the gunfire began.
""And I said, 'Nicholas, get down.' And Nicholas ducked. And we just started listening and there, just repetitive shots ... and I just said, 'Nicholas, run,'"" she said.
Moonshadow said she tried to attend to a victim she saw lying on the pavement outside the store, but her son pulled her away, telling her, 'We have to go.'"" She broke down in sobs recounting their ordeal, adding, ""I couldn't help anybody."" 
Police said the accused gunman was taken to a hospital for treatment of injuries but did not explain how he was hurt. There was no word on when he might face an initial court appearance.
Video footage broadcast by television stations showed a shirtless, bearded man in boxer shorts being led away from the store limping and in handcuffs before he was placed on a stretcher and loaded into an ambulance. One of his legs appeared covered in blood. 
The killings added to a long line of mass shootings in Colorado that include some of the most shocking episodes of gun violence in modern U.S. history.
In 2012, a young man dressed in tactical gear burst into a movie theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora during a midnight screening and sprayed the audience with gunfire, killing 12 and wounding 70. In 1999, a pair of students went on a shooting rampage at Columbine High School near Littleton, Colorado, murdering 12 classmates and a teacher before taking their own lives. 
In Washington, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, wrote on Twitter that President Joe Biden had been briefed on the shooting. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, said the violence again underscored the need for stricter gun laws, which have stalled in Congress amid Republican opposition.
Video captured by an onlooker on Monday, apparently while the shooting was still in progress, was posted to social media and aired on TV stations. The footage shows two bodies lying in the grocery store parking lot, before the person with the camera walks inside and films a third body, as three shots are heard in the background.
The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, Local 7, which represents 32 employees at the King Soopers outlet, credited some of the grocery workers with helping customers escape through a rear exit.
It also thanked customers and emergency responders who ""acted swiftly to prevent even greater loss of life.""

The shooting occurred about 2 miles (3 km) from the flagship campus of the University of Colorado, in the Table Mesa area of the city that is home to a residential neighborhood and the hilltop laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

DHAKA (Reuters) - At least 15 people have been killed in a massive fire that ripped through a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh, while at least 400 remain missing, the U.N. refugee agency said on Tuesday.
""It is massive, it is devastating,"" said UNHCR's Johannes Van der Klaauw, who joined a Geneva briefing virtually from Dhaka, Bangladesh. ""We still have 400 people unaccounted for, maybe somewhere in the rubble."" 
He said the UNHCR had reports of more than 550 people injured and about 45,000 displaced.
Bangladeshi officials are investigating the cause of the blaze even as emergency and aid workers and families sift through the debris looking for further victims. The fire ripped through the Balukhali camp near the southeastern town of Cox's Bazar late on Monday, burning through thousands of shanties as people scrambled to save their meagre possessions. 
""Everything has gone. Thousands are without homes,"" Aman Ullah, a Rohingya refugee from the Balukhali camp, told Reuters. ""The fire was brought under control after six hours but some parts of the camp could be seen smoking all night long.""
Authorities in Bangladesh have so far confirmed 11 deaths. 
Some 40,000 huts in the camp were burned down, said Mohammad Mohsin, secretary of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, after visiting the camp.
Two major hospitals of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Turkish government were also destroyed, he told reporters in Cox's Bazar.
""A seven-member committee has been formed to investigate the matter,"" he said.
Sanjeev Kafley, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies's delegation head in Bangladesh, said more than 17,000 shelters had been destroyed and tens of thousands of people displaced.
More than a thousand Red Cross staff and volunteers worked with fire services to extinguish the blaze, spread over four sections of the camp containing roughly 124,000 people, he said. That represents around one-tenth of an estimated 1 million Rohingya refugees in the area, Kafley said.
""I have been in Cox's Bazar for three-and-a-half years and have never seen such a fire,"" he told Reuters. ""These people have been displaced two times. For many, there is nothing left.""
BARBED WIRE
Some witnesses said that barbed wire fencing around the camp trapped many people, hurting some and leading international humanitarian agencies to call for its removal. 
Humanitarian organization Refugees International, which estimated 50,000 people had been displaced, said the extent of the damage may not be known for some time.
""Many children are missing, and some were unable to flee because of barbed wire set up in the camps,"" it said in a statement.
John Quinley of Fortify Rights, a rights organization working with Rohingya, said he had heard similar reports, adding the fences had hampered the distribution of humanitarian aid and vital services at the camps in the past.
""The government must remove the fences and protect refugees,"" Quinley said. ""There have now been a number of large fires in the camps including a large fire in January this year... The authorities must do a proper investigation into the cause of the fires.""

The vast majority of the people in the camps fled Myanmar in 2017 amid a military-led crackdown on the Rohingya that U.N. investigators said was executed with ""genocidal intent"", charges Myanmar denies.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Reviving memories of its battle for independence from Ottoman Turkish rule 200 years ago, Greece is preparing to defy the coronavirus with bicentennial celebrations on Thursday that it hopes will mark a turning point after a very difficult decade.
Greece emerged from the biggest bailout in economic history in 2018 after years of painful austerity that drove it deep into poverty. One in two young Greeks was unemployed and more than half a million people left the country to find work abroad.
No sooner had the economy started to recover, than the coronavirus pandemic hit and Greece slipped back into recession.
However the conservative government, which announced the independence day celebrations as a sign that Greece was back soon after it came to power in 2019, is determined to press ahead, even if events have been scaled back sharply. 
""Especially for young people, I believe such symbolic dates can really mark a break from the past,"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said this week.
""The challenge immediately after the pandemic is not just to take a few steps of improvement but many brave leaps of progress.""
Although the coronavirus has meant celebrations are smaller and many events moved online, some have been held.
'FREEDOM OR DEATH!'
In Agia Lavra, one of Greece's oldest monasteries, actors wearing the kilt-like dress of Greek revolutionaries last week re-enacted the taking of the legendary oath of ""Freedom or Death!"" - the slogan of revolt against Ottoman rule.
Greece was under Ottoman rule for nearly 400 years since Ottoman Turks invaded what was then Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine empire, in 1453.
Scattered uprisings in 1821 escalated into a full-scale war which - helped by the intervention of Britain, France and Russia - finally resulted in the establishment of an independent kingdom of Greece in 1832.
""The importance of this milestone year, this milestone anniversary, is that we have a message; it speaks about the rebirth of the country,"" said Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, a former parliamentarian leading the 2021 organizing committee.
""After 10 years of crisis, Greece is still standing,"" she said from the National Mint, which has issued commemorative coins of modern Greece's first currencies, the Phoenix and the Drachma.
The annual military parade on March 25, Greece's national day, will be a muted affair, with the country in lockdown.
French President Emmanuel Macron had to pull out of the visit but Britain's Prince Charles and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin are expected to attend and French and U.S. fighter jets will take part.
France, which will be represented at the parade by its defence minister, has also donated a magnificent tapestry depicting Renaissance painter Raphael's ""The School of Athens"" of ancient Greece's great thinkers.

""The School of Athens symbolizes all of our commitment to democracy,"" French Ambassador Patrick Maisonnave said. ""It reminds us of all the Western Republics owe to the Greek Republic.""

(Reuters) -Property and casualty insurer Hartford rejected a $23.24 billion takeover offer from larger rival Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd on Tuesday, derailing what would have been the largest deal in the property and casualty insurance sector since 2016. 
Hartford said its board had determined that entering into talks about a deal would not be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.
Chubb had made a $65 per share offer for the insurer on March 18, a premium of about 13% to Hartford's closing stock price a day earlier.
A deal between Hartford and Chubb would be the biggest in the sector since Aon (NYSE:AON) Plc's $30 billion bid to buy Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) last year, and the largest in the U.S. P&C insurance space since Chubb was created in its current form in January 2016.
Chubb's bid for Hartford has come after its chief executive officer, Evan Greenberg, warned in April that the pandemic would likely spur the single-largest loss in the industry's history. 
The insurance industry has faced claims from businesses that are losing revenue because the coronavirus-led crisis has led to canceled events and travel disruption, with the virus also causing an unprecedented loss of lives. 
Chubb booked $1.19 billion in pandemic-related losses in 2020. The insurer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. 
Hartford's small-business insurance franchise would be the main draw for Chubb, which currently focuses on covering mid-sized and large companies. 
Founded in 1810, Hartford famously sold baseball slugger Babe Ruth an insurance policy in 1920 for disability protection and also insured the only home Abraham Lincoln ever owned.
The insurer has also provided coverage for former U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower's 190-acre farm, the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge.
Chubb, which has underwritten the production of ""E.T. the Extra Terrestrial"", traces its roots to 1882.

The 800-page report into the archdiocese of Cologne between 1975 and 2018 found 202 abusers and 314 victims, and said Church officials had failed in their duties in some 75 cases.
It prompted the Archbishop of Hamburg to offer his resignation to the Vatican and Cologne Archbishop Rainer Maria Woelki has suspended three other officials.
In his official public response to the report, Woelki, who was himself cleared, acknowledged many mistakes had been made and that victims had not been heard.
""The reputation of the church was given higher priority than the pain of the victims,"" he told reporters, adding that administrative chaos, unclear areas of responsibility and negligence had led to a cover-up caused by the system.
""This should never have been allowed to happen and it is high time we tackle it,"" he said. ""I want to and I will listen,"" said Woelki, widely criticised for not publishing an earlier report and commissioning a new one instead.
He acknowledged that he had also made mistakes.
""Moral responsibility lies with me,"" Woelki said, adding that although he had not broken any laws, he had not done everything possible in the clearing up of cases.
The Archdiocese will set up a commission to work through abuse cases, introduce more rigorous procedures for investigating reports of abuse and be more meticulous in keeping records.
The report comes as the Catholic Church in Germany discusses a Synodal Path reform project on issues such as homosexuality, the ordination of women and sexual morality. 
Launched a year ago by the bishops and laypeople, the project is aimed at rebuilding trust lost in the decade-old abuse scandal but some Catholics warn it could cause a schism. 

An unprecedented number of people are leaving the Church in Cologne which with its landmark Gothic cathedral has the largest membership of any diocese in the German-speaking world.

There was no immediate confirmation by Saudi authorities or the Saudi-led military coalition that has been battling the Houthis for six years, of an attack on Abha airport which has been repeatedly targeted by cross-border attacks.
""Our operations will continue as long as the aggression and siege continue,"" Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in a Twitter post.
Saudi Arabia and the United States have urged the group to accept the ceasefire initiative which Riyadh said would also include reopening Sanaa airport and allow fuel and food imports through Hodeidah port, both of which are under Houthi control.
The Houthis' chief negotiator had told Reuters that the Saudi offer fell short of their demand for a complete lifting of the air and sea blockade, but that the group would continue to talk to Saudi Arabia, the United States and mediator Oman in pursuit of a peace deal.
The movement has stepped up drone and missile attacks on Saudi Arabia, including on oil facilities, and a ground offensive to seize Yemen's gas-rich Marib region. The coalition has responded with air strikes on Houthi military sites.
Yemen has been mired in violence since the Saudi-led coalition intervened in March 2015 after the Houthis ousted the internationally recognised government from power in the capital Sanaa.
The conflict is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis, who now control most of northern Yemen, deny being puppets of Tehran and say they are fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression.

68,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 09:30AM ET</span>","In Italy, manslaughter probes worsen vaccine turmoil","By Angelo Amante and Crispian Balmer
ROME (Reuters) - When alarm about potential side effects of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 shot halted vaccinations around Europe this month, many people worried this would damage public trust in the vaccine. In Italy, legal action has added to the turbulence.
On March 11, a prosecutor in the Sicilian city of Syracuse placed two doctors and a nurse under investigation for possible manslaughter, following the sudden death of a navy officer just hours after he had received the shot made by AstraZeneca PLC.
Prosecutor Gaetano Bono also ordered the nationwide seizure of tens of thousands of doses of the same batch of vaccine. He told Reuters it was a precautionary measure. But his move angered health practitioners, who said they saw no need for it.
Italy as elsewhere is pinning its hopes on mass inoculations to overcome the crisis after registering some 105,000 COVID-19 deaths -- more than any of its EU partners -- and suffering its worst economic slump since World War Two.
The country's drive to vaccinate the vast majority of its 60 million citizens by September got off to an inauspicious start, hit by slower-than-expected vaccine deliveries and bad publicity for the AstraZeneca vaccine, seen as crucial in the pandemic because it is easier and cheaper to transport than other shots.
Days after the Syracuse case, a magistrate in northern Italy ordered police to impound almost 400,000 shots from a separate AstraZeneca batch after another sudden, post-jab death.
The Italian legal action pre-dates a decision by more than a dozen European countries, including Germany, France and Italy, to halt use of the vaccine after reports linked it to a rare blood clotting disorder in a very small number of people.
The European Medicines Agency said last week a preliminary review suggested the vaccine was not associated with an increase in the overall risk of blood clots, leading most governments to resume its use. 
But doctors in Italy said the prosecutors have added to mistrust in a country with an entrenched anti-vaccination movement. Only 62% of Italians said they planned to get a COVID shot, according to a poll by British research company Ipsos MORI published in December.
""How can we be expected to vaccinate millions of people in these conditions?"" said Massimo Galli, head of the infectious diseases department of Sacco Hospital in Italy's financial capital Milan.
""The medics that I know are absolutely furious about this absurd situation.""
The World Medical Association, which represents physicians from 115 countries, said doctors and nurses elsewhere in Europe did not face the same kind of legal threat.
""In any other country in the European Union, this would not be considered manslaughter,"" said Dr. Frank Montgomery, the WMA's council chairperson. ""Possible side-effects from a vaccination would never lead to the prosecution of a doctor.""
AstraZeneca said it is ready to cooperate with the investigation and has confidence in the justice system. Its vaccine has been found in trials to be up to 79% effective and the company said on Sunday that additional testing had given no cause for concern about its safety. 
Legal experts say doctors and the government can do nothing to influence the magistrates' response. The health ministry declined to comment.
Under the Italian constitution, prosecutors are fully independent and cannot be subject to external pressure of any kind. In addition, the law obliges them to investigate any case that is drawn to their attention.
""An investigation has to run its course and public opinion cannot be taken into account,"" Syracuse prosecutor Bono told Reuters, rejecting suggestions he had overreacted to the death of the navy officer. Stressing that he did not have any fears of the vaccine, Bono said he had received an AstraZeneca jab hours after talking to the dead man's family.
AUTOPSY
The navy officer, 43-year-old Stefano Paterno, had no known medical condition when he went to be vaccinated at the Augusta military hospital, on the east coast of Sicily, on the morning of March 8, his wife told La7 television. Hours later he developed a slight fever, but it had vanished by the time he went to bed.
At around 2.00 a.m. he had an apparent seizure and although an ambulance arrived swiftly, he died shortly afterwards.
His wife said the family had asked the local prosecutors' office to see whether there was a link between the death and the inoculation.
Prosecutor Bono immediately opened a probe into possible manslaughter and subsequently cited a nurse and two doctors as possible suspects, as well as the head of AstraZeneca in Italy. The names of the medics were not released.
Bono said that by targeting the suspects so early, he had enabled them to appoint lawyers to follow the subsequent autopsy.
""It is a guarantee for them. It gives them the right to participate in the proceedings and to have their say,"" he told Reuters.
Medical unions say such investigations are deeply upsetting for their staff.
""This is a simple intramuscular injection. You cannot be held responsible for any possible side effects,"" said Carlo Palermo, head of the doctors' union ANAAO-ASSOMED.
""Can you imagine the negative personal repercussions for every doctor caught up like this? They have to find a lawyer, a technician to attend the autopsy ... It is very disturbing.""
According to Italy's criminal code, a medic can only be prosecuted for malice or gross negligence. Unions say the Syracuse case suggests possible grey areas and want the government to offer those carrying out vaccinations specific legal protection.
Health Minister Roberto Speranza told Corriere della Sera newspaper that this would be a good idea.
At a corporate level, AstraZeneca and the EU have agreed the company would have the responsibility of defending its shot in the courts in any eventual legal fight. But an EU official told Reuters in September that the bloc's governments had agreed they would pay claims over possible side-effects above an agreed limit. 
VACCINES IMPOUNDED
Unlike prosecutor Bono, another prosecutor in the northern town of Biella did not cite any suspects when she launched an investigation last week into the death of Sandro Tognatti, a 57-year-old music teacher who died the day after his AstraZeneca shot.
However, that prosecutor, Teresa Angela Camelio, did order the sequestration of 393,600 doses of the AstraZeneca that came from the same batch, as a preventative measure to see if the vaccines were spoiled.
Camelio declined to comment on the case.
A police official confirmed that Carabinieri police had visited vaccination storage centres across Italy, and placed doses from the batch in sealed boxes. These will remain in the centres as the investigation continues.
Government data showed the impounded doses represented around 20% of the AstraZeneca shots Italy had in storage at the time. The shots have been locked away even though limited supplies have hampered the EU's vaccination efforts.

The sequestered vaccines will expire within six months. Both the Syracuse and Biella prosecutors have declined to say how long their investigations will take, saying they need time to complete their analysis.
Prosecutors in the Sicilian city of Catania took less than a week to open and close their investigation into the case of a 50-year-old policeman, who died in March after falling ill in the wake of his AstraZeneca vaccination.
In a statement on March 18, prosecutor Carmelo Zuccaro said there was nothing to suggest the death was linked to the vaccine. ""The strength of our opinion is shown by the fact that I myself and the vast majority of magistrates and staff of this office have had the vaccine,"" Zuccaro wrote.

A Palestinian official said on Sunday that Riyad al-Maliki's VIP card, a pass granted by Israel to allow senior Palestinian officials to move freely through border crossings, had been confiscated.
The Israeli government has declined to comment on the matter.
""We have raised the matter with the (Israeli) embassy (and) informed them that, as a host country, the Netherlands is very invested in the fact that the ICC must be able to carry out its work without interference,"" a Dutch foreign ministry spokesman said.
ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced this month that she would investigate war crimes in the Palestinian territories, after the court ruled that it had jurisdiction in the case.
“We will not be subject to intimidation as we seek justice for victims of atrocity crimes committed in Palestine,"" said Rawan Sulaiman, who serves as head of the Palestinian mission in the Netherlands and Palestinian representative to the ICC.
Sulaiman called on ICC member states ""to support the integrity, impartiality and independence of the ICC, particularly, in light of the threats it, and those cooperating with it, continue to face.”
Israel, which does not recognise the jurisdiction of the ICC, and the United States, which has not ratified its founding statute, have both denounced the war crimes investigation.
Under former President Donald Trump, the United States imposed financial sanctions against Bensouda and her team. 
Bensouda said in December 2019 that war crimes had been or were being committed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and named both the Israel Defense Forces and armed Palestinian groups such as Hamas as possible perpetrators.

Maliki met with the prosecutor in The Hague last week to urge her to accelerate the investigation, his office said.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - India's federal police have charged 71 people for rioting and arson during deadly protests over environmental concerns at Vedanta (NYSE:VEDL) Ltd's copper smelter in Tamil Nadu state three years ago, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
Police opened fire to beat back the protesters in the southern seaside town of Thoothukudi where 13 people were killed, causing national outrage and the subsequent closure of the Sterlite Copper plant in May 2018 for alleged pollution.
The Central Bureau of Investigation has framed charges on 17 counts including damage to public property and possession of deadly weapons, one of the sources said. These charges carry a maximum penalty of up to seven years in prison.
The charges have not yet been made public. The top law enforcement agency did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The company in which Indian-born resources magnate Anil Agarwal has a controlling stake, denied it is in breach of environmental laws. 
One policeman has also been charged, a second source said, without providing additional details.
Witnesses had said after the incident police opened fire without warning in violation of the police manual, prompting demands from political parties in Tamil Nadu that police officers be held accountable. (https://reut.rs/395sC5a)
The CBI accused ""identified and unidentified persons with dishonest common intentions intention of committing riots,"" according to the source who has reviewed the document outlining the charges. 
The accused knew ""fully well that they are forming an unlawful assembly and prevented policemen from discharging duty,"" the source quoted the CBI as saying in the document. 
DEADLIEST IN A DECADE
Vedanta's Copper smelter is one of only two major copper smelters in India and it had announced plans to double its capacity, igniting protests from residents and workers worried it would damage the air and water of the town. 
The environmental protest was the deadliest in India in a decade. A working group of United Nations' human rights experts condemned the ""apparent excessive and disproportionate use of lethal force by police"".
Twelve of the protesters were killed with shots to the head and chest, autopsy reports later showed. Half of the victims were shot from behind, the post-mortem reports showed, potentially indicating that those shot were not an immediate threat to police. (https://reut.rs/3rdLKUM)Police have previously said they were overwhelmed and opened fire because they feared the protesters were about to attack people in government offices and apartments housing Vedanta workers.

The CBI said in its charge sheet that the protesters were ""armed with deadly weapons, committing mischief using fire and explosive substances, using assault and criminal force to deter public servants from discharging duties,"" according to the first source.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union should start negotiations on deeper trade ties with Turkey but be ready to impose economic sanctions if Ankara moves against the bloc's interests, according to a report prepared for a summit of EU leaders this week.
The offer of closer economic links, mixed with threats, reflects the complex relationship between Turkey, an EU candidate, and the world's largest trading bloc, which have drifted apart but are now seeking improved ties.
""Strengthening our already substantial economic ties is another win-win situation for both sides .... At the heart of this would be the modernisation and expansion of the scope of the current EU-Turkey Customs Union,"" said the report by EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell and the European Commission. 
The report, made public on Tuesday, said Turkey deserved more financial support for hosting millions of Syrian refugees, as well as visa-free travel to the EU, more high-profile diplomatic contacts and an expanded customs union.
But such progress would only be possible if Turkey, respected human rights and showed greater flexibility over the divided island of Cyprus and hydrocarbon rights in the eastern Mediterranean.
Taking back almost 1,500 migrants living on Greek islands, and whose legal appeals have now been exhausted, would also be critical. 
""The situation of refugees in Turkey continues to deteriorate, aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn. Therefore, continued EU support will be required over the next years,"" said the report.
The EU is expected to provide fresh funds from 2022 for the four million refugees that Turkey hosts, following some six billion euros ($7.13 billion) spent over the past four years. 
TOURISM SANCTIONS
The report said Turkey had failed to align its sanctions policy with that of the EU in the area of foreign policy, as it should have. Its policy on Libya often ran contrary to EU aims.
In December EU leaders proposed asset freezes and travel bans over Turkey's ""unauthorised drilling activities"" for natural gas in disputed waters in the eastern Mediterranean.
But a more constructive tone from Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan this year prompted the EU to halt work on those sanctions.
The report said a sliding scale of sanctions, to be used only as leverage, could include punitive measures on individuals, moving up towards important sectors such as energy and tourism.
Targeting tourism, which accounts for up to 12% of the Turkish economy, appeared to be a new threat from Brussels, which has decried Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian rule. Turkey's EU membership talks are frozen.
""Should Turkey not move forward constructively in developing a genuine partnership with the EU, it should be made clear that this would bear political and economic consequences,"" it said.

Navalny, 44, is serving a two and half year jail term on charges he called fabricated after returning to Russia from Germany in January where he was recovering from what doctors said was a nerve agent poisoning. 
His supporters staged three protests this year during the pandemic at the height of winter. The authorities said they were illegal and broke them up with force, prompting the opposition to declare a moratorium. 
On Tuesday, Navalny's allies launched a political campaign with its own website ""Free Navalny"" and said they would announce a date for a new nationwide street protest once 500,000 people had registered to attend. 
""A protest with 500,000 people taking part will be the biggest in the history of modern Russia,"" said Ivan Zhdanov, head of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation.
""We'll hold a peaceful rally in the streets of all of Russia's cities,"" Leonid Volkov, a close Navalny ally, said. 
The West has demanded Russia release Navalny from jail, something Moscow has called unacceptable interference in its internal affairs. 

Russian authorities say they have seen no evidence that Navalny was poisoned and have suggested Navalny is a Western puppet sent back to try to destabilise the political situation in Russia.

Abiy said that Eritrean troops had entered along the border because they were concerned they would be attacked by Tigrayan forces, adding that the Eritreans had promised to leave when Ethiopia's military was able to control the border. 
The governments of both Eritrea and Ethiopia have repeatedly denied Eritrea's involvement. 
Reuters journalists on a trip to Tigray last week saw truckloads of Eritrean soldiers on the main road between the regional capital Mekelle and Shire, and on the main streets of Shire. 
Abiy quoted the Eritreans as saying to Ethiopian authorities: ""You left the trenches while searching for the enemy in central Tigray. So, while you attacked them, they might come to us. We controlled areas along the border because we have our national security concerns. But if your army can control the trenches, we will leave the next day."" 
He said the Ethiopian government had also raised accusations of widespread looting and rights abuses by Eritrean soldiers. 
""The Eritrean government has highly condemned it and said they will be accountable if any of their army participated in this.""
Fighting erupting in Tigray after forces loyal to the regional government - the Tigray People's Liberation Front - attacked army bases across the region overnight and in the early hours of Nov. 4.

PARIS (Reuters) - France summoned China's ambassador on Tuesday to underscore the unacceptable nature of insults and threats aimed at French lawmakers and a researcher, and Beijing's decision to sanction some European officials, a French foreign ministry source said.
Ambassador to France Lu Shaye had already been summoned by the foreign ministry last April over posts and tweets by the embassy defending Beijing's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and criticising the West's handling of it. 
The Chinese embassy last week warned against French lawmakers meeting officials during an upcoming visit to self-ruled Taiwan, drawing a rebuff from France.
Since then it has been in a Twitter spat with Antoine Bondaz, a China expert at the Paris-based Foundation for Strategic Research, in which the embassy has described him as a ""small-time thug"" and ""mad hyena"".
""It continues to be unacceptable and has crossed limits for a foreign embassy,"" the French official said after Lu was received by the head of the foreign ministry's Asia department.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Lu's behaviour was creating an obstacle to improving relations between China and France.
The United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada imposed sanctions on Chinese officials on Monday for human rights abuses in Xinjiang, in the first such coordinated Western action against Beijing under new U.S President Joe Biden.
In retaliation, the Chinese Foreign Ministry sanctioned several European nationals, including French Member of the European Parliament Raphaël Glucksmann.

The envoy had been told of France's disapproval of that decision, the French official said, adding that Lu was ""visibly shocked by the extremely direct character of what he was told"" and had tried to change the conversation to discuss Taiwan.

In rare public comments outside legal rulings, the Supreme Court said in a statement threats to lawyers had ""very serious repercussions"" on the rule of law and pledged to do more to protect members of the judiciary.
""The Court condemns in the strongest sense every instance where a lawyer is threatened or killed and when a judge is threatened and unfairly labeled,"" it said in a statement read by spokesman Brian Keith Hosaka.
It ordered lower courts and the public to share details of threats and killings of lawyers in the past 10 years so it could plan its next course of action, adding it will provide security to those threatened.
The court also said it will set rules requiring law enforcers to wear body cameras when conducting searches and serving warrants to prevent abuses and cover-ups.
In the last five years under President Rodrigo Duterte, 61 lawyers and judges were murdered, the most under any government administration, data from the National Union of Peoples' Lawyers (NUPL) and the Free Legal Assistance Group showed. 
Many of the lawyers killed were representing left-wing activists, victims of the government's deadly anti-narcotics campaign or victims of human rights violations, the group said.
Edre Olalia, president of the NUPL, said in a statement ""we fervently welcome these bold and unequivocal declarations, initial steps and further plans from our very own refuge."" 
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In his war on drugs, Duterte has been accused of allowing a culture of impunity to flourish.
Police data shows more than 6,000 drug suspects were killed since Duterte came to power in 2016, though officers reject activists' allegations they are executing drug suspects, insisting those who died were violently resisting arrest.

Moscow said earlier this month it had slowed the speed of U.S.-based Twitter inside Russia and on March 16 threatened to ban the social media service outright in a month over content from child pornography to drug abuse.
With Twitter widely used in Russia by government opponents, including Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and his allies, Twitter said at the time it was worried about free speech and denied that it let its platform be used to promote illegal behaviour.
The watchdog, Roskomnadzor, said in a statement that Twitter was too slow in tackling illegal posts. 
""The rate at which the social network is removing banned information is unsatisfactory,"" it said. ""Two thirds of material that is harmful for children remains available on Twitter."" 
The watchdog said it was unacceptable to see new posts containing child pornography, suicide propaganda and information about drug use and distribution appearing on Twitter.
Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Major social media companies have been embroiled in an increasing number of disputes around the globe, from China to India and Australia, as governments seek to curb their power.

CHENNAI (Reuters) -Coal India Ltd, the world's largest coal miner, could venture into solar wafer manufacturing and wants to ""aggressively"" participate in the country's solar energy auctions, its chairman told Reuters on Tuesday.
Pramod Agarwal said its joint venture with state-run NLC India Ltd plans to invest around 125 billion rupees ($1.73 billion) in solar power projects with a capacity of 3,000 megawatts, of which Coal India will invest some 60 billion rupees by March 2024. 
At the same time, it plans to keep closing small mines and stay away from opening those that would entail mass hiring, Agarwal said. The group closed 82 mines in the three years to March 2020, resulting in cuts to its workforce of 18,600 employees.
""Coal as you know, we're going to lose business in the next two, three decades. Solar will take over (from) coal slowly as a major energy provider in the coming years,"" Agarwal said in an interview.
""We are just exploring the possibilities where we can invest in solar wafer production, nobody is (currently) there in the country,"" he said.
India, which makes solar cells and modules but not wafers, is planning to levy customs duties on some solar equipment from April 2022 as it looks to expand local manufacturing capacity. 
Agarwal said the company's steadily falling headcount would lead to a major reduction in costs. ""The net reduction of employees is to the tune of 13,000 to 14,000 per annum,"" he said.
State-run Coal India will face increased costs due to periodical wage revisions for non-executive employees, effective from July 1, 2021. 

""But manpower reduction will have a stabilizing effect, so the wage bill effect may be flat,"" Agarwal said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - On a recent morning in Chicago's Southwest side, young workers hefted boxes of food into vans for delivery. Borders staked out by rival gangs prevented many hungry people from visiting the New Life Centers' food distribution site. So workers brought the food to them. 
A year ago, food had a small role at New Life Centers, a church and community outreach program that works to defuse gang tensions. Since June 2020 however, the organization has partnered with local food banks and donors to provide food to around 6,000 families each week. It will continue the stepped-up effort even when the pandemic is over, finding that food delivery opens doors for conflict-resolution workers. 
    ""That's how relationships get built,"" said Paulino Vargas, New Life Centers' street outreach program manager.
The United States, the world's richest country, had pockets of hunger before the pandemic put millions of people out of work last year. But now the problem has intensified in urban and rural areas where residents do not have consistent access to nutritious food. Demand at Feeding America, a national network of food banks, rose by 60% during the pandemic. 
Even as the U.S. economy recovers with government stimulus and falling COVID-19 cases, hunger worsens. The Congressional Budget Office in February predicted the number of Americans using food stamps to buy food would peak at 44 million in 2022, up from 36.8 million pre-pandemic, before starting to decrease in 2023.
In the past, food security was mainly the concern of food banks and food pantries, but now all kinds of community organizations and other groups are getting involved - from anti-violence workers in Chicago to New York City probation officers. Meanwhile, food pantries nationwide have changed in ways that will continue post-pandemic. 
Working with partners such as the Food Bank for New York City, the New York probation department has in recent months increased from once to three times a week the number of days the Nutrition Kitchen food pantries it runs are open and plans to continue the longer hours after the pandemic. The department sees the food pantries as a way to address recidivism as well as to help the wider community.
""People can't get back on their feet if they're hungry,"" said Steve Cacace, who as director of the probation department's Community Resource Unit leads the pantry project. 
The department also will keep turning to people on parole to help out at the pantries. In some cases, as when Eric Burks started packing boxes of food and tracking the numbers of people served at a Nutrition Kitchen in his home borough of Queens, it can help people complete community-service hours.
""I finished my community service, I started coming back every day,"" Burks said. After a day in which he might help serve more than 200 people at the pantry, he uses a shopping cart to deliver food to neighbors who are unable to make the trip to the Nutrition Kitchen.
In Chicago, New Life Centers' executive director, Matt DeMateo, has seen an opportunity for young people to be empowered ""as givers.""
When her college transitioned to online learning during the pandemic, Diana Franco, 20, dropped out and poured more time into volunteering at New Life Centers. With government grants and private donations, the center hired 15 new employees to manage food aid, including Franco as food distribution coordinator. 
'A PAYCHECK AWAY'
It is not just in big cities that people have risen to the challenge of hunger in a pandemic.
Schoolteacher Courtney Walker helps run a food pantry with her family in Atwood, a village of about 1,000 in southern Illinois. Walker said her pantry at Atwood First Baptist, working with partners such as the Eastern Illinois Foodbank, served about 60 families a month before the pandemic and more than 100 by last summer. 
Her husband Tim, a mechanic, said Atwood families regularly drive 40 miles (64 km) to stock up at a full-service grocery store on items they cannot obtain at their local Dollar General (NYSE:DG) store. People on fixed incomes in Atwood cannot always afford the gasoline. The pandemic recession, Tim Walker said, revealed how many were ""a paycheck away from not being able to afford three meals a day.""
The Walkers started pre-packing boxes of food to limit contacts that could have spread the coronavirus. They are eager to return to allowing people to browse the pantry shelves as if they were in a grocery store, which they say is more dignified.
But in Wisconsin, the Walworth County Food Pantry said it will continue contactless delivery. Giving pre-packed boxes of food to cars is more hygienic and efficient and requires fewer volunteers than having people crowd in to indoor facilities, employees said.
In Denver, the organization that runs one of the city's largest pantries is calling for more direct cash payments from the federal government to allow people to shop for themselves in stores, moving away from a model that largely relies on food that might otherwise go to waste being distributed to the needy by food pantries. 
    ""We'd like to cut ourselves out of the equation,"" said Teva Sienicki, CEO of the Denver pantry organization Metro Caring.
The Biden administration's stimulus plan includes payments of $1,400 for eligible Americans as well as periodic payments in the second half of the year in the form of an expanded child tax credit.
    Sienicki said putting ""cash in people's pockets"" allows them to buy items like diapers or toothpaste that are not covered by food stamps.

    Pantries such as Metro Caring's can support people after an emergency, Sienicki said. But she questioned how efficiently, effectively and fairly they can serve large numbers of people who could take years to recover from the pandemic recession.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday pledged to rebuild and revitalise the transatlantic military alliance after a bruising four years when Washington portrayed NATO as outdated, divided and in crisis.
The first top U.S. official to visit NATO since President Joe Biden took office in January, Blinken said the alliance was at a pivotal moment but could emerge stronger after internal disputes over Turkey and Russian gas.
""I've come here to express the United States' steadfast commitment (to NATO),"" Blinken told reporters as he met NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. ""The United States wants to rebuild our partnerships, first and foremost with our NATO allies, we want to revitalise the alliance.""
After four years of friction with Washington under the presidency of Donald Trump, who said the alliance was obsolete and harangued allies over defence spending targets, NATO's European allies have welcomed the change in tone, saying they are once again being consulted on strategy.
""The last thing we can afford to do is take this alliance for granted,"" said Blinken, a longtime Biden confidant who is seeking to repair damage done by Trump's ""America First"" policy. 
Blinken said China's military rise and Russia's attempts to destabilise the West were threats that required NATO to come together, urging Turkey in particular to embrace the 30-member nuclear alliance.
Having already bought Russian weapons, Turkey briefly blocked NATO defence plans in 2019 and launched an offensive on U.S.-backed rebels in Syria, prompting French President Emmanuel Macron to assert that NATO was ""experiencing brain death"".
""Turkey is a long-standing and valued ally,"" Blinken said before a NATO meeting of foreign ministers, and it was in Ankara's interest to remain in the alliance.
AFGHANISTAN
Stoltenberg has set out areas where NATO could modernise - from climate measures to more sustainable funding of military operations - and needs U.S. support.
Asked about any possible withdrawal from Afghanistan, Blinken said a U.S. review of options was still underway and he would listen and consult with allies. NATO foreign ministers will discuss Afghanistan over the next two days in Brussels.
""We went in together, we have adjusted together and when the time is right, we will leave together,"" Blinken said of Western involvement in the country.
Germany's push to complete construction of a controversial gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea from Russia remained a divisive issue. Blinken said Nord Stream 2 ran counter to the European Union's interests and could undermine Ukraine. He said he would raise the issue with his German counterpart Heiko Maas.
""President Biden has been very clear, he believes the pipeline is a bad idea, bad for Europe, bad for the United States, ultimately it is in contradiction to the EU's own security goals,"" Blinken said.

""It has the potential to undermine the interests of Ukraine, Poland and a number of close partners and allies,"" Blinken said, saying that a U.S. law required Washington to impose sanctions on companies participating in the project.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union ministers agreed on Tuesday to extend to the end of July the bloc's catch limits for fish stocks shared with Britain, to ensure fishing can continue uninterrupted while Brussels and London seek a full-year deal.
In their post-Brexit trade deal, the EU and Britain agreed to jointly set limits each year for fishing their shared stocks after Britain completed its exit from the 27-country bloc on Dec. 31.
They had hoped to negotiate this month a full-year agreement on fishing opportunities for 2021. 
As a temporary solution, EU ministers agreed to keep applying last year's EU catch limits for shared stocks until July 31. The temporary rule, covering stocks including plaice, cod, haddock and whiting, was due to expire on March 31. 
""We found a solution so that EU fleets can continue to operate in their traditional fishing grounds after 31 March,"" said Portuguese maritime minister Ricardo Serrao Santos, who chaired the meeting.
A European Commission representative said EU-British talks last week made significant progress towards a proper agreement, but that the roughly 75 fish stocks concerned meant the talks were complex and required further time.
Brussels sets annual limits on catches from around 100 commercial stocks of fish shared between EU countries in European waters, to avoid over-fishing.
The EU and Britain are also negotiating catch limits for shared deep-sea stocks in 2022.
Separately, Norway, Britain and the EU this month reached a deal on catch limits for jointly managed North Sea fish stocks following Brexit.
Access to one another's fish stocks became a vexed issue in Brexit divorce negotiations, with the two sides ultimately agreeing a gradual fall in the quotas European fleets can catch in British waters, reaching a 25% reduction in value terms after 5-1/2 years. 

After that, there will be annual talks to set the amount EU boats can catch in British waters and vice-versa.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Opposition parties say Turkey is paying a steep price for President Tayyip Erdogan's wayward economic policies after his shock firing of the central bank governor sent Turkish financial markets reeling.
Erdogan dismissed Naci Agbal on Saturday, two days after the governor raised rates to curb inflation. Erdogan then appointed a critic of tight policy who is expected to reverse recent rate hikes, fuelling fears of political meddling in monetary policy.
The lira slumped as much as 15% after the move, stocks dived and government yields jumped, piling pressure on the credit-fuelled emerging economy, which has been prone to booms and busts during Erdogan's 18 years in power.
Sahap Kavcioglu, a former lawmaker from Erdogan's ruling AK Party (AKP) who shares the president's unorthodox view that high interest rates cause inflation, is Turkey's third central bank chief since mid-2019. 
""Turkey is paying the price for Mr Erdogan's thoughtless and reckless decisions with high interest rates, unemployment and high inflation,"" Iyi Party chairwoman Meral Aksener told her party's lawmakers in a speech in parliament.
Erdogan recently announced an economic reform package but Aksener said it lacked credibility. She said Turkey's economic woes - with inflation above 15%, high unemployment and a gaping current account deficit - left no alternative to high rates.
""High interest rates have become necessary. High interest rates are a fever medicine, not a permanent cure. As the treatment is delayed, it is inevitable for the patient to die,"" said Aksener, head of the fifth largest party in parliament.
'UNPRECEDENTED INCOMPETENCE'
Faik Oztrak, deputy head of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), slammed what he called the AKP's ""ideological blindness"".
""It is truly unprecedented incompetence to cause the Turkish lira to lose more than 10% in a single day two days after interest rates were raised,"" he told a Monday news conference.
Erdogan has not commented on the move but a deputy head of the AKP, Nurettin Canikli, said Agbal had been dismissed because he did not use monetary policy instruments rationally.
Aksener said her party supported Agbal prioritising price stability and faulted Erdogan's economic management, under a presidential system which came into force after a 2018 election.

""Turkey has no macroeconomic problems. Turkey has macro-Erdoganic problems... What is the solution? To immediately get rid of this failed system and return to a parliamentary democracy,"" she said.

Kinshasa (Reuters) - The Democratic Republic of Congo released its last confirmed Ebola patients from treatment centers on Monday, health authorities said, beginning a 42-day countdown to declaring the country free of the virus.
Monday's release of six patients from treatment centers in the North Kivu region could mark the end of a month-long resurgence of the 2018-20 epidemic, which killed more than 2,200 people before it was initially declared over in June 2020.
Twelve cases have been reported since the virus re-emerged at the beginning of February, killing six people. It's been three weeks since North Kivu health authorities have detected a new case.
An Ebola outbreak is typically declared over once 42 days have passed, after blood samples from the last confirmed case tests negative for the probably originated in a human source rather than from the virus jumping the species barrier as it has in previous outbreaks.
Ebola can be transmitted to humans from animals like bats or monkeys. It can live on in parts of the body of survivors otherwise in good health such as the eyes, breasts and testicles and sometimes still be transmitted, for example through semen.

84,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 06:21AM ET</span>","Expulsions, releases, hotels: Migrant families at U.S.-Mexico border face mixed U.S. policies","By Mica Rosenberg, Ted Hesson and Mimi Dwyer
DEL RIO, Texas (Reuters) - U.S. officials are trying to drive home an increasingly emphatic message to the growing number of mostly Central American asylum seekers crossing the U.S.-Mexico border every day: ""Do not come. The border is closed."" 
The reality on the ground is less clear. 
While the United States is expelling migrant families and individuals to Mexico under a Trump-era public health order to limit the spread of the coronavirus, thousands of families have been released into the United States in recent weeks pending the outcome of their immigration cases.
On the same day Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas went on five U.S. Sunday television shows to issue the warnings, U.S. border agents in Texas' Rio Grande Valley began releasing migrant families to relieve pressure on crowded border facilities without set dates to appear in immigration court.
The varied handling of families is bewildering migrants and causing frustration among both immigration advocates and border agents. It has also left President Joe Biden, a Democrat, open to criticism from Republicans that his mixed messaging at the border is encouraging more people to cross even as border facilities fill up past capacity amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The majority of migrants encountered at the border this year have been single adults mainly from Mexico who are often quickly deported and sometimes cross multiple times.
But the number of families arrested nearly tripled in February from a month earlier to about 19,000. During that same period, the number of unaccompanied children caught at the border rose as well, but at a slower pace.
""There is a lot of confusion because there is no hard and fast rule"" when it comes to migrant families, said Charlene D'Cruz, the director of Lawyers for Good Government's Project Corazon border rights program. ""It seems ad hoc.""
Also over the weekend, even as the administration said the border was closed to families, it announced an $86 million contract to house some migrant families deemed vulnerable in U.S. hotels for processing. The contract is part of a new program managed by nonprofit organizations as an alternative to federal family detention centers.
Online forums are awash with questions from would-be migrants about the current status of the border and whether families with children are being allowed to cross. The posts, seen by Reuters, can net over a hundred often contradictory answers from fellow migrants and some claiming to be smugglers. 
SOME EXPELLED, SOME RELEASED
Mayorkas said on Sunday that only unaccompanied minors were exempt from the expulsions policy, known as Title 42, that the Trump administration put in place in March 2020 at the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic. 
But internal U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data shared with Reuters showed only around 15% of families apprehended on March 17 were expelled under Title 42. While just a one-day snapshot, the figure shows the uneven application of the policy across the border.
One reason: some local authorities in Mexico say they do not have the resources to deal with the sharp increase in the number of families, many traveling with very young children. 
Tamaulipas state, across from the Rio Grande Valley, stopped receiving expelled families with children under 7 years of age earlier this year. 
In a move that circumvents the Mexican state's refusal, the Biden administration has begun flying hundreds of families - including parents traveling with babies and toddlers - hundreds of miles (kilometers) across Texas to El Paso only to expel them to Ciudad Juarez, according to Reuters' witnesses and interviews with migrants. 
At the same time, U.S. border patrol agents in the same Rio Grande Valley region - which is experiencing the highest number of crossings from Mexico - have begun releasing families into the United States without ""notices to appear"" in immigration court on specific dates, according to two CBP officials who requested anonymity to discuss internal operations. 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Sarah Peck said that given fluctuating migration flows, ""one day or week of statistics doesn't reflect the full picture,"" adding that the policy is still to expel families ""and in situations where expulsion is not possible due to Mexico's inability to receive the families, they are placed into removal proceedings.""
A CBP spokeswoman said all migrants go through routine background checks before being released.
The Trump administration also released some families without notices to appear in immigration court during a sharp upsurge in border crossings in 2019, according to a report published by two research centers at the University of California, San Diego.
Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar from Texas released photos on Monday showing people crammed closely together, some laying on mats or on the floor in a border patrol facility in Donna, Texas. 
Cuellar wrote on Twitter that ""more has to be done to address this growing humanitarian crisis"" affecting migrant children.
LUCK OF THE DRAW
The expulsions can be devastating for parents like Manuel de Jesus Martinez who said he left Honduras in mid-January with his 10-month old baby daughter after he said her mother was killed. 
He crossed the Rio Grande river near the Mexican city of Reynosa into the United States ""because I heard they were giving asylum,"" he said in an interview. U.S. border agents put Martinez and his baby on a flight to El Paso only to expel them back to Mexico.
For other migrant families released into the United States in recent days, there is a deep sense of relief after long, perilous journeys from their home countries.
Valin, a Haitian migrant who asked to only be identified by his first name, was freed from border patrol custody in Del Rio, Texas, with his wife and two children, a 14-year-old son and a 1-year-old daughter, just days after they crossed the Rio Grande.
The family had left Haiti in 2016 and slowly made their way to the border. Valin had feared he and his family would be immediately deported when they got to the U.S. border. Instead, border patrol let them go. They hope to stay with relatives in Florida.

""Thank God, we were lucky,"" he said.

85,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 06:10AM ET</span>",The 'shadow docket': How the U.S. Supreme Court quietly dispatches key rulings,"By Lawrence Hurley, Andrew Chung and Jonathan Allen
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the months before former President Donald Trump left office in January, the U.S. Supreme Court briskly paved the way for the lethal injection of 13 federal inmates, the first federal executions in 17 years.
In many of those cases, the court summarily overturned lower court rulings using an obscure legal procedure known as the “shadow docket.” But the short-circuit approach, intended only for emergencies, isn’t reserved for death penalty cases. It has, in the last four years, significantly changed the way the high court does business.
Increasingly, the court relies on the shadow docket to make decisions in a wide range of consequential cases, often in a dramatically accelerated fashion and without providing signed opinions or detailed explanations. Sometimes, as in death penalty cases, the decisions are irreversible.
Cases on the docket can be effectively resolved even as lower courts are continuing to assess them – sometimes even before all the evidence is known. Decisions can come in the middle of the night, with no public discussion and no guidance to lower-court judges on how to analyze similar cases.
The speed and secretiveness has drawn criticism from legal experts both on the right and left, who call it an improper use of the court’s tremendous power.
“It's hard for the public to know what is going on, and it's hard for the public to trust that the court is doing its best work,” said William Baude, a conservative law professor at University of Chicago Law School who coined the phrase “shadow docket” and has called for greater transparency.
To get on the shadow docket, any litigant can apply to a single justice, who decides whether to forward the dispute to the full court. Five votes among the nine justices are needed to grant a request. No oral arguments are made but opposing attorneys can file briefs in opposition. To be granted, the request must meet certain criteria, including that the applicants would suffer ""irreparable harm"" if it is not granted. 
The public generally sees the court as sorting out matters of national importance through extensive briefing, oral arguments and lengthy rulings that explain the law. But the number of substantive shadow docket decisions rose dramatically during the Trump administration. In those four years, the government filed shadow docket applications at 20 times the rate of each of the two previous eight-year administrations. The high court granted the government’s requests in a majority of cases.
The high court has continued to use the shadow docket post-Trump. In recent cases, including several last month, the conservative majority freed churches from local government dictates aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus - without the usual benefit of lawyerly arguments to air the merits of both sides.
“If (the justices) can make significant decisions without giving any reasons, then there’s really no limit to what they can do,"" said David Cole, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
Through a spokesperson, the Supreme Court justices declined to comment.
With the court’s 6-3 conservative majority, the expedited process could halt some of President Joe Biden’s policy goals in their tracks, including on such issues as immigration, the environment and social issues such as abortion and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights.
As part of its normal oversight function, the House Judiciary Committee panel held its first hearing on the shadow docket on Feb. 18 during which members from both parties expressed concerns about its secretive nature.
Some Republican officials, however, welcome the chance to quickly block Biden administration policies by filing their own emergency applications. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, a Republican, said that he and other GOP attorneys general would “absolutely” consider filing shadow docket applications to halt Biden policies they believe are unlawful. 
“It’s really the opportunity in which the winner and loser is declared"" immediately, he said.
Hashim Mooppan, a lawyer who served in the Trump administration's Justice Department, defended the high court's use of the docket in recent cases, noting that many requests were prompted by lower court rulings in specific jurisdictions that nonetheless blocked policies nationwide.
“If someone is going to speak to these issues on a nationwide basis, it makes sense it is the Supreme Court,"" he said.
BREAKING NORMS
The Trump administration won shadow docket requests in 28 of 41 cases during his term – a near 70% success rate, according to Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law. Just eight were filed in 16 years by the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, four of which were granted.
""There is clear one-sidedness here,” said Baude, the University of Chicago law professor. “The government, especially the federal government, has a special ability to get the court’s attention.”
Although the shadow docket has long been part of the Supreme Court’s operations, The Trump Justice Department broke norms by repeatedly resorting to these emergency applications to undo the actions of lower courts it disliked – sometimes leapfrogging appeals courts along the way.
The most obvious change came in federal death penalty cases. Between July and January, the justices on eight occasions, often with little or no explanation, overturned lower court rulings that had put federal executions on hold. 
The high court cleared the way for Lisa Montgomery’s execution in the early hours of Jan. 13 for a gruesome Missouri murder, for instance, in a terse two-sentence order. The 52-year-old Missouri inmate had been sentenced to death for the December 2004 strangulation of Bobbie Jo Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant at the time. Montgomery cut Stinnett’s fetus from the womb and tried to pass off the child as her own before she was arrested.
Two lower courts had paused the execution on technical grounds. The justices offered no rationale in overturning both decisions.
Montgomery died by lethal injection 90 minutes after the court’s last decision.
For Montgomery's sister, Diane Mattingly, the high court's swiftness was a baffling and “cavalier” way to make such a grave decision, with no debate or explanation.
""If they'd taken time to do that, then I would have understood,” she said. “But they didn't.”
The federal executions offered a glimpse of unease among some on the court over the growing power of the shadow docket, especially when they lifted stays of executions entered by lower courts.
The last time that happened, on Jan. 15, the court’s three liberal justices objected.
“This is not justice,” liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissenting opinion, citing the novel issues raised in the cases.
Conservative justices have said that although death penalty cases often consume years, lawyers representing death row inmates wait until the last minute to file claims and are, in essence, seeking to game the system.
In 2015, during oral arguments in another death penalty case, conservative Justice Samuel Alito called such tactics part of a “guerilla war” against the death penalty.
‘SHOCKINGLY ARBITRARY’
Besides its role in the spate of federal death penalty cases, the shadow docket figured prominently in an array of other highly contentious cases.
One five-sentence order in December 2017 allowed Trump, a Republican, to ban travelers from several Muslim-majority countries. A four-sentence order in January 2019 similarly granted Trump’s request to ban most transgender troops from the military. Another order in July 2020 – in just one sentence – allowed Trump to redirect military funds to build part of a wall on the southern border with Mexico.
“It just felt shockingly arbitrary,” said Shannon Minter, a lawyer at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, an LGBT rights group that challenged the transgender military policy, recalling the court’s decision in that case. 
“It felt like really casting aside the normal judicial process in a very, very heavy-handed way,” Minter said.

Biden immediately reversed the ban with an executive order when he took office in January.

BEIJING/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia and China said on Tuesday they wanted a summit of permanent members of the U.N. Security Council amid what they called heightened political turbulence, with Moscow saying they both believed the United States was acting in a destructive way.
The two allies, whose relations with the West are under increasing strain, made the call for a summit in a joint statement after talks between their foreign ministers in the city of Guilin. 
""At a time of increasing global political turbulence, a summit of the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council is particularly necessary to establish direct dialogue about ways to resolve humankind's common problems in the interests of maintaining global stability,"" they said in a statement published on the Russian foreign ministry's website.
Moscow has long been pushing for such a summit. 
The statement did not mention the United States by name. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news conference after talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that Moscow and Beijing were both unhappy with U.S. behaviour.
""We noted the destructive nature of U.S. intentions, relying on the military-political alliances of the Cold War era and creating new closed alliances in the same spirit, to undermine the U.N.-centered international legal architecture,"" said Lavrov.
""We emphasised that against the background of active attempts by the West to promote its concept of a 'rules-based world order', the joint efforts of Russia and China...to preserve the modern system of international law are becoming more and more relevant.""
Both countries' ties with Washington are strained.
U.S. and Chinese officials on Friday concluded what Washington called ""tough and direct"" talks in Alaska, while Russia's ambassador is back in Moscow for talks after U.S. President Joe Biden said he believed President Vladimir Putin was a killer.
Kicking off his two-day trip to China on Monday, Lavrov issued a call for Moscow and Beijing to reduce their dependence on the U.S. dollar. 
Tuesday's joint statement urged other countries to refrain from interfering in the domestic affairs of Russia and China.
Lavrov said Russia and China regarded European and Western sanctions as unacceptable.
On Monday, the United States, European Union, Britain and Canada imposed sanctions on a handful of Chinese officials for alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang. 
Russia too is braced for a new round of U.S. sanctions over what Washington says was its meddling in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, which Moscow denies.
Lavrov also took a swipe at the European Union, accusing Brussels of destroying Russia-EU ties. He said that Moscow only had relations with individual EU nations now.

""On the Western front there are no changes, but in the East there is an intensive agenda which grows richer every year,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Travellers from England will face 5,000 pound ($6,900) fines in new legislation designed to deter non-essential trips and barricade the nation against imported COVID-19 infections.
The news was a disappointment to millions of people hoping for a summer holiday and sent travel stocks - including easyJet (LON:EZJ), British Airway-owner, Jet2 and TUI - down 2-4% in early trade on Tuesday.
Travel shares had also fallen on Monday.
The United Kingdom has had one of the worst COVID-19 tolls in the world, but deaths and infections are falling fast and a successful vaccination campaign is finally breathing confidence back into the population and the economy.
However, as a gradual easing of lockdown is set to begin from this weekend, the government is warning that people may have to sacrifice long-desired holidays abroad.
""We are seeing this third wave rising in some parts of Europe and we're also seeing new variants and it is very important that we protect the progress that we've been able to make here in the UK,"" health minister Matt Hancock told Sky News.
EXTENSION OF BAN?
The United Kingdom currently bans all foreign travel, except for work, education or health reasons. However, the government is to review that in April and possibly allow it from May 17. 
The new travel fines were included in legislation applying until the end of June in case the ban is not eased, Hancock said, adding to other comments by officials hinting at an extension of the prohibition.
Hancock said it was too early to say for sure.
The legislation, which went to parliament on Monday, would be voted on during Thursday's session and, if approved as expected, come into force on March 29th, he said. 
It applies only to England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland may follow suit.
The European travel sector, which usually benefits from the millions of Britons who take trips abroad, are now bracing for a second lost summer.
Britain's travel sector has lost more than 45,000 jobs and passenger numbers at the biggest airport, Heathrow, have fallen to their lowest since 1966 during the crisis. 
The government's review on April 12 is expected to introduce a risk-based traffic light system where countries are classified as ""green"" or ""red"".

Unal's comments came amid financial market turmoil after Erdogan dismissed the central bank governor on Saturday, two days after he raised rates to curb inflation. Erdogan appointed a critic of tight monetary policy in his place. 
Asked about the anticipation of a reshuffle, Unal said: ""When talk begins of change, inevitably when one part changes, there is a movement throughout the system"". He alluded to parliamentary and presidential elections in 2023. 
""With a view to 2023, not just to the party, there will be a new adjustment in the team. We will see this in the coming days,"" he added.

Speculation over reshuffle grew in November when Erdogan sacked the previous central bank governor and when the finance minister, his son-in-law Berat Albayrak, quit. At the time Erdogan said reshuffle rumours were unfounded.

90,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 05:10AM ET</span>",Scottish parliamentary committee says it was misled by First Minister Sturgeon,"LONDON (Reuters) - A Scottish parliamentary committee said on Tuesday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon misled it over evidence she gave about her handling of sexual harassment complaints, a potential breach of the ministerial code of conduct.
The findings come the day after an independent inquiry by a senior lawyer concluded she had not broken the code in any of her dealings with her predecessor Alex Salmond, the subject of complaints by several women. 
The parliamentary committee said in its report that the Scottish government's handling of complaints was ""seriously flawed"". 
A narrow majority of its members concluded that it was hard to believe that Sturgeon had no knowledge of concerns about Salmond's inappropriate behaviour before Nov. 2017 and suggested that she had misled the committee.
Members of Sturgeon's Scottish National Party (SNP) disagreed with this conclusion.
The fiercely disputed issue of how Sturgeon and her administration dealt with the complaints against Salmond has upended Scottish politics at a time when the stakes could hardly be higher, with the nation's future hanging in the balance.
Elections to the Scottish parliament are due in May, and Sturgeon has vowed to press for a second independence on independence from the United Kingdom if the SNP wins an absolute majority.
It was expected to do so before the Salmond row blew up, but the latest polls suggest the outcome of the elections looks far less certain now, with Sturgeon's popularity dented by an endless stream of negative headlines about the Salmond affair.
Salmond and Sturgeon were once close friends and allies in the cause of Scottish independence, but their vitriolic falling out has jeopardised that cause at a time when it looked like the political momentum was in its favour.
Tuesday's verdict by the parliamentary committee will cause Sturgeon ongoing political headaches, but appears unlikely to put her job at risk after the endorsement on Monday from the independent lawyer who investigated her conduct.

Sturgeon has already dismissed the parliamentary committee as partisan.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian official played down on Tuesday prospects for a breakthrough at the first talks in three years with neighbouring Pakistan aimed at resolving long-running disputes over hydroelectric projects on the shared Indus River.
Pakistan is concerned that India's plans for hydroelectric plants in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir will damage the flow of the river, which feeds 80% of its irrigated agriculture, along with tributaries. 
India has defended the construction of its Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai dams, saying they are allowed by the Indus Water Treaty brokered by the World Bank.
""It is our job to find a middle path. But to say we can achieve something is maybe a bit too optimistic,"" an Indian official involved in the talks in New Delhi told Reuters.
""There are many things on which we can't compromise,"" added the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions. 
India issued no statement on the talks, which are set to end on Wednesday.
The talks come after a gap of three years because of tension over Kashmir, the Muslim-majority territory both south Asian nations claim in full.

In recent weeks, the nuclear-armed rivals have taken tentative steps to improve ties, such as a rare military pact last month to stop firing on the Kashmir border that has killed scores of civilians.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladeshi officials began investigating the cause of a massive fire that killed at least seven and displaced tens of thousands at a Rohingya refugee camp, as officials sifted through the debris looking for more victims on Tuesday.
The fire ripped through the Balukhali camp near the southeastern town of Cox's Bazar late on Monday, burning through thousands of hutments as people scrambled to save their meagre possessions. 
Police have so far confirmed seven deaths. 
""We have information of seven people that died in the fire. Among them, three children were buried last night. Today four bodies were recovered .... all burnt beyond recognition,"" said Zakir Hossain Khan, a senior police official.
""The cause of the fire is still unknown,"" Khan told Reuters by telephone from the camps. ""Authorities are investigating to determine the cause of the fire.""
Sanjeev Kafley, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies's delegation head in Bangladesh, said more than 17,000 shelters had been destroyed in the blaze, and tens of thousands had been displaced.
The fire spread over four sections of the camp containing roughly 124,000 people, around one-tenth of the more than 1 million Rohingya refugees in the area, he added.
""I have been in Cox's Bazar for three and a half years and have never seen such a fire,"" he told Reuters. ""These people have been displaced two times. For many there is nothing left.""
BARBED WIRE
Some witnesses said that barbed wire fencing around the camp trapped many people, hurting some and leading international humanitarian agencies to call for its removal. 
Humanitarian organization Refugees International, which estimated 50,000 people had been displaced, said the extent of the damage may not be known for some time.
""Many children are missing, and some were unable to flee because of barbed wire set up in the camps,"" it said in a statement.
John Quinley of Fortify Rights, a rights organization working with Rohingya, said he had heard similar reports, adding the fences had hampered the distribution of humanitarian aid and vital services at the camps in the past.
""The government must remove the fences and protect refugees,"" Quinley said. ""There have now been a number of large fires in the camps including a large fire in January this year... The authorities must do a proper investigation into the cause of the fires.""

The vast majority of the people in the camps fled Myanmar in 2017 amid a military-led crackdown on the Rohingya that U.N. investigators said was executed with ""genocidal intent"", charges Myanmar denies.

BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada imposed sanctions on Chinese officials on Monday for human rights abuses in Xinjiang, the first such coordinated Western action against Beijing under new U.S. President Joe Biden.
Beijing hit back immediately with punitive measures against the EU that appeared broader, including European lawmakers, diplomats, institutes and families, and banning their businesses from trading with China.
Western governments are seeking to hold Beijing accountable for mass detentions of Muslim Uighurs in northwestern China, where the United States says China is committing genocide.
China denies all accusations of abuse.
The coordinated effort appeared to be early fruit in a concerted U.S. diplomatic push to confront China in league with allies, a core element of Biden's still evolving China policy. 
Senior U.S. administration officials have said they are in daily contact with governments in Europe on China-related issues, something they call the ""Europe roadshow."" 
""Amid growing international condemnation, (China) continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in statement ahead of meetings with EU and NATO ministers in Brussels this week. 
Canada's foreign ministry said: ""Mounting evidence points to systemic, state-led human rights violations by Chinese authorities."" 
Activists and U.N. rights experts say at least 1 million Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang. The activists and some Western politicians accuse China of using torture, forced labour and sterilisations. China says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism. 
The European Union was the first to impose sanctions on Monday on four Chinese officials, including a top security director, and one entity, a decision later mirrored by Britain and Canada. 
Those also targeted by the United States were Chen Mingguo, director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau and another senior official in the region, Wang Junzheng.
The United States had already last year designated for sanctions the top official in Xinjiang, Chen Quanguo, who was not targeted by the other Western allies on Monday, to avoid a larger diplomatic dispute, experts and diplomats said.
The foreign ministers of Canada and Britain issued a joint statement with Blinken, saying the three were united in demanding that Beijing end its ""repressive practices"" in Xinjiang. 
Evidence of abuses was ""overwhelming"", including satellite imagery, eyewitness testimony, and the Chinese government's own documents, they said.
Separately, the foreign ministers of Australia and New Zealand issued a statement expressing ""grave concerns about the growing number of credible reports of severe human rights abuses against ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang"" and welcoming the measures announced by Canada, the European Union, Britain and the United States.
FIRST MAJOR EU SANCTIONS IN DECADES
The move by the U.S. and its allies follows two days of talks https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2BB216 between U.S. and Chinese officials last week, which laid bare the tensions between the world's two largest economies.
The EU accused Chen Mingguo of ""arbitrary detentions and degrading treatment inflicted upon Uighurs and people from other Muslim ethnic minorities, as well as systematic violations of their freedom of religion or belief"".
Others hit with travel bans and asset freezes were: senior Chinese officials Wang Mingshan, the former deputy party secretary in Xinjiang, Zhu Hailun, and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Public Security Bureau.
The EU has sought to avoid confrontation with Beijing and Monday's sanctions were the first significant measures since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, although Brussels targeted two computer hackers and a technology firm in 2020 as part of broader cyber sanctions. 
The steps were praised by the United States. ""A united transatlantic response sends a strong signal to those who violate or abuse international human rights,"" Blinken said. 
While mainly symbolic, the EU sanctions mark a hardening towards China, which Brussels regarded as a benign trading partner but now views as a systematic abuser of rights and freedoms.
Britain has repeatedly denounced torture, forced labour and sterilisations that it says are taking place on an ""industrial scale"" in Xinjiang and repeated its criticism of Beijing on Monday.
'POINTLESS'
Beijing's reprisal was swift.
Retaliation included sanctions on European lawmakers, the EU's main foreign policy decision-making body known as the Political and Security Committee and two institutes.
On Tuesday, China also summoned the EU ambassador, Nicolas Chapuis, to lodge a ""solemn protest"" and demand that the bloc correct its error to prevent further damage to relations.
""The so-called sanctions based on lies are not acceptable,"" Wang Yi, foreign minister and state councillor, said separately during a joint briefing with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. 
German politician Reinhard Butikofer, who chairs the European Parliament's delegation to China, was among the most high-profile figures to be hit. The non-profit Alliance of Democracies Foundation, founded by former NATO secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, was on the list, according to a statement by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Also included was Adrian Zenz, a German scholar whose research was cited by the State Department last year when highlighting alleged abuses in Xinjiang.
The Netherlands summoned China's ambassador to The Hague after Beijing announced its measures on 10 Europeans, while the European Parliament, along with German, Dutch, Belgian and other foreign ministers, rejected the Chinese retaliation. 
""These sanctions prove that China is sensitive to pressure,"" Dutch lawmaker Sjoerd Sjoerdsma, who was put on China's sanctions list, said on Twitter. ""Let this be an encouragement to all my European colleagues: Speak out!"" 
Restricted from entering China or doing business with it, Beijing accused its targets of seriously harming the country's sovereignty over Xinjiang.

All 27 EU governments agreed to the bloc's punitive measures, but Hungary's foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, called them ""harmful"" and ""pointless"".

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian authorities issued fresh flood warnings and evacuation orders on Tuesday as torrential rains again pummelled several parts of the country, sweeping away homes, roads and livestock in the worst downpour in more than half a century. 
The national weather agency has posted severe weather warnings in every mainland state or territory but one, affecting around 10 million people in the country of 25 million, across an area the size of Alaska.
""The rain and flood situation does remain dynamic and extremely complex,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters.
No deaths were reported, but thousands of people have been rescued by emergency services in recent days. About 18,000 people have been evacuated with authorities expecting about 15,000 others to join them.
Images shared on social media showed entire bridges washed away, stranded animals and submerged homes in New South Wales, the most populous and most affected state. 
One video showed a container truck ramming into a bridge, causing structural damage, while another showed a car swept off a road by raging floodwaters in neighbouring Queensland.
Other photos captured mass swarms of spiders and snakes as the creatures sought to escape the fast-moving flood waters.
In NSW, a fourth consecutive day of heavy rain was expected to combine with a coastal trough over the coming 24 hours, increasing the deluge.
""Weather conditions have worsened, and those weather conditions are likely to worsen during the day so many communities will experience increasing heavy rainfall,"" said NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian.
The owner of a restaurant that was underwater on the banks of the Hawkesbury River, 62 km (38 miles) north of Sydney, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp that he rescued a neighbour's baby who needed medical attention by boat.
""My brother rang and said 'please get over here, we have to get this baby out'. We got them across the river and to a car,"" restaurant owner Darren Osmotherly said.
Warragamba Dam, Sydney's main water supply, began overflowing on Saturday and was expected to keep doing so for another week. A year earlier, amid drought and bushfires, the same dam fell below half its water catchment, triggering severe water restrictions.
Though the weather system is likely to start easing from late Wednesday, officials warned affected residents may not be able to return to their homes immediately as incessant rains dump more water in river catchment areas.
COAL DELIVERIES
Coal deliveries to Port of Newcastle, north of Sydney, the world's biggest coal export port, were halted earlier because flooding shut rail lines.
On Tuesday, the country's biggest independent coal miner, Whitehaven Coal Ltd, said it was forced to stop shiploading at the port due to structural faults, while weather-related port restrictions were slowing ship movements.

The company said road flooding may also hamper workforce movements and cut its forecast coal sales to a range of 18.5 million to 19 million tonnes, from a range of 19 million to 20 million previously.

The operation, across 53 provinces, was part of a sustained crackdown against the network of U.S.-based preacher Fethullah Gulen. More than 250 people were killed in the failed putsch in July 2016. Gulen denies any involvement.
Prosecutors ordered the detention of a total 184 suspects, including 123 serving military personnel, Anadolu said. It said suspects were also targeted in northern Cyprus, where the Turkish military is deployed. 
Police were conducting operations to capture the remaining suspects, it said. Among the suspects are two colonels, seven majors, 10 captains and 22 lieutenants.
In the wake of the coup attempt, some 80,000 people were held pending trial and some 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others were sacked or suspended. More than 20,000 people have been expelled from the Turkish military.

96,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 03:05AM ET</span>",Inside the 'spring revolution' opposing Myanmar's military coup,"By Poppy McPherson
(Reuters) - For the last seven weeks, Myint Htwe has been moving between secret locations, organizing meetings and planning protests. 
The 45-year-old is one of a group of deposed Myanmar lawmakers attempting to reconstruct the civilian government after it was dissolved by the military in its Feb. 1 coup.
What he is doing is treason, punishable by death, according to announcements by the military. 
“We are fugitives now,” he told Reuters by phone from one of several hideouts, having left his wife and two children behind for their safety. “We are working in secret, together.” 
Myint Htwe and scores of other politicians, officials and activists are taking part in an unprecedented struggle for control of Myanmar playing out across the country and overseas. Reuters interviews with eight people working with the opposition provided a detailed account of how they are organizing. 
Almost two months after the coup, the army is still facing street protests and strikes in most of the country’s major cities. Martial law is in effect in six townships in Yangon, the biggest city and former capital. Many people on the streets are using a three-fingered salute for resistance to authoritarian government and are calling it a “spring revolution.”
Myint Htwe said he is working with the Committee Representing the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), a body set up by deposed lawmakers, which aims to consolidate the resistance to the junta, creating new government structures capable of restoring order to the country and appealing to foreign nations for recognition. The junta says the body, which is operating in secret, is illegal. 
He was one of dozens of lawmakers from the northern Sagaing region who swore themselves into a new regional parliament on Feb. 7. Some joined via video-conferencing service Zoom, others huddled around his laptop on a mat, he told Reuters. He took his cue from the CRPH, which oversaw the reformation of the national parliament three days earlier.
On March 14, CRPH acting vice-president Mahn Win Khaing Than, a former lawmaker and the group’s de facto leader, addressed the public for the first time in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) broadcast. “This is the darkest moment of the nation and the moment that the dawn is close,” he said. The CRPH said in a statement last week it had decriminalized acts of self-defence by people against the junta’s forces. 
Myanmar’s military and police did not respond to requests for comment about the organization.
A spokesman for the junta said in a news conference on March 11 that it did not “accept” CRPH and would take action against the group. The military has not said how many people affiliated with the CRPH have been arrested by security forces.
CRPH has no official spokesman. Dr Sasa, a medical doctor who goes by one name, has spoken publicly on behalf of the group. The  military said it has charged both Sasa and Mahn Win Khaing Than with treason in absentia. The two are in hiding.
PEOPLE’S ADMINISTRATIONS 
State media reported in early February that Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of Myanmar’s military, described the coup as inevitable after the army’s allegations of fraud in the general election of November 2020 were ignored. Independent international poll watchers have said there were no major irregularities in the election, in which Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy won 83% of the seats.
The coup ended a decade-long experiment in democracy in the Southeast Asian nation of 53 million, shattering hopes that it would emerge from more than half a century of military rule that kept the country isolated and impoverished. 
Since then, security forces have killed at least 261 people, mostly at street protests, and detained more than 2,600 people, according to the nonprofit Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. People detained include the country’s elected leader Suu Kyi and members of her party, two of whom have died in custody. Telecom companies have said publicly they have been told by the army to shut down access to mobile internet and some Wi-Fi services. The army has not commented on the shutdown.
Many government workers are on strike, along with teachers and medics, meaning almost all civic offices, schools and hospitals are shut. Many private banks are also closed because of strikes. Imports have plunged as there are insufficient port staff to clear goods. Scarcity is pushing up prices of most goods while the currency depreciates.
In response to the chaos, the junta has deployed troops across the country, setting up roadblocks, occupying hospitals and universities in major cities and forcing civilians to comply with orders. State media issues frequent entreaties to civil servants to return to work and some of those striking have been evicted from government housing. The CRPH said on its website it has been raising funds online to pay civil servants so they can stay on strike longer. 
Sasa told Reuters the group was seeking to access $1 billion in Myanmar’s funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which the bank froze after the coup to prevent the junta from withdrawing it.
The strikes are part of a wider civil disobedience movement, known as the CDM, that has sprung to life. At least 400 police have fled across the border to India, saying they will not serve the junta.
One of the CRPH’s main tasks has been the formation of so-called people’s administrations across the country, organizing protests and implementing orders from an acting cabinet of 17 ministers, who are in hiding, issuing instructions via the CRPH Facebook page, which has more than 1.6 million followers, according to people working with them. Recently, the group declared the army a terrorist organization. The army has not responded publicly to that accusation. 
The CRPH also announced the abolition of the police disciplinary act, which punishes officers who disobey orders, in an attempt to encourage more desertions. There is no evidence that the police, ultimately controlled by the military, will recognize the change. Police officials could not be reached for comment.
Facebook, the biggest source of information for most people in Myanmar, has removed most of the military’s official channels, citing the likelihood of further violence, leaving them with only state television broadcasts to address the population.
CHAOTIC SITUATION
Amid the chaos, analysts monitoring the situation told Reuters it is hard to tell who controls certain parts of Myanmar. The CRPH has announced people’s administrations have been formed in all but one of the 45 townships of Myanmar’s commercial hub of Yangon, all but two in Mandalay, the second city, and all of six other regions. About 24 million people, more than a third of the population, now live in these areas.
Philipp Annawitt, a former adviser to Myanmar’s parliament with the United Nations Development Programme, who now works as a researcher and analyst, said although CRPH-aligned local administration bodies were quickly formed in Yangon, the heavy presence of security forces makes it difficult for them to act in practice.
But in rural regions where security forces have less of a presence, Annawitt said the new local administrations are making sure water and electricity services continue while helping to organize and fund strikes and protests.
Myint Htwe told Reuters he had helped form such people’s administrations in all 37 of the Sagaing region’s townships, organizing protests and implementing instructions of ministers at the community level.
“If I run out of money, I will sell my car,” he told Reuters.
In Yangon, the local administrations were formed quickly in co-ordination with night-watch groups organized by local leaders and young protesters in response to nightly raids by soldiers, said a political scientist working on the ground with the CRPH who asked not to be named for security reasons. 
Some of the administrations have been formed secretly, according to the political scientist, while others have been announced on social media. Myanmar has a strong tradition of community organization and many groups previously helped with the response to the new coronavirus, two of the people interviewed by Reuters said. 
They have now turned to running the resistance. “We all lost our future. We couldn’t work on anything else, have to focus on this,” the political scientist said.
INTERNATIONAL STAGE 
Beyond the fight to run local administrations, a similar battle for recognition as the legitimate government of Myanmar is playing out on the international stage.
Sasa, who also acts as the CRPH’s international envoy, has been holding virtual meetings with the leaders of ethnic armed groups based around Myanmar’s borders, who control vast swathes of territory in Myanmar and have been locked in decades-long wars with the military, vying for greater autonomy. 
About a quarter of the country’s population lives in an area where at least one ethnic armed group claims territory. Sasa has said publicly that Myanmar will become a federal democracy, a long-held demand of ethnic groups, if the resistance prevails. 
The CRPH scored an unexpected international victory on Feb. 26 when Kyaw Moe Tun, Myanmar’s permanent representative to the United Nations, told a meeting of the world body that the junta was illegitimate and pledged his support to the new civilian government as he held back tears and made the three-finger salute.
More than two dozen Myanmar diplomats have followed suit, from Los Angeles to Geneva and Berlin, saying they will not work for the junta, local media have reported. After Kyaw Moe Tun’s speech, the military recalled about 100 envoys around the world.
Kyaw Swar Tun, third secretary of the Washington D.C embassy, who is from a military family but said he has rejected army rule along with half the staff, said he watched the speech through tears. 

“I cried. Everybody did,” he told Reuters, saying that he will not follow orders from the army. “I am decided to struggle to close down this military regime.”

BOULDER, Colo. (Reuters) -A gunman opened fire at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, on Monday, killing 10 people, including the first police officer to arrive on the scene, before the bloodied suspect was arrested in the second deadly U.S. mass shooting in a week.
Police gave few immediate details of the latest shooting and no known motive for the violence, which unfolded at about 3 p.m. at a King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, a north-central Colorado city at the eastern foot of the Rockies, about 28 miles (45 km) northwest of Denver.
Frantic shoppers and employees fled for cover through the supermarket as law enforcement officers swarmed the scene, located about 2 miles from the University of Colorado's flagship campus.
Sarah Moonshadow, 42, a customer and Boulder resident who was in the store with her son, Nicholas, recounted scenes of pandemonium as gunfire rang out from inside the store.
""We were at the checkout, and shots just started going off,"" Moonshadow told Reuters. ""And I said, 'Nicholas get down.' And Nicholas ducked. And we just started listening and there, just repetitive shots ... and I just said, 'Nicholas, run.'""
Moonshadow said she tried to go to the aid of a victim she saw lying on the pavement just outside the store, but her son pulled her away, telling her, 'We have to go.'"" The woman broke down in sobs, adding, ""I couldn't help anybody."" 
The bloodshed came less than a week after gun violence last Tuesday that left eight people dead, including six Asian women, at three day spas in and around Atlanta. A 21-year-old man has been charged with those killings.
HANDCUFFED AND BLEEDING
Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold, her voice choking with emotion, said 10 people died in the attack at King Soopers grocery. Among them was 51-year-old policeman Eric Talley, an 11-year veteran of the Boulder police force, who she said was the first officer to respond to the shooting. He was the father of seven children, according to his father.
Police said the gunman, who was not publicly identified, was injured in the violence but they gave no further details. 
Video footage from the scene broadcast earlier by television stations showed a shirtless, bearded man in boxer shorts being led away from the store in handcuffs, before he was placed on a stretcher and loaded into an ambulance. The man in custody appeared to have a bloody leg and was limping. 
Colorado has been the scene of some of the most shocking mass shootings in modern U.S. history. 
In 2012, a young man dressed in tactical gear burst into a movie theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora during a midnight screening and sprayed the audience with gunfire, killing 12 and wounding 70. In 1999, a pair of students went on a shooting rampage at Columbine High School near Littleton, Colorado, murdering 12 classmates and a teacher before taking their own lives. 
One man who was shopping inside the King Soopers store with his wife told KCNC-TV that he heard three gunshots and ran through the store with other customers to escape through a loading bay at the rear of the building.
He said the shots sounded like they came from the checkout area at the front of the store.
Authorities gave few details about how the shooting unfolded. Commander Kerry Yamaguchi of the Boulder Police Department told reporters several hours after the fact that investigators were just starting to process the crime scene.
""Boulder has suffered a terrible and horrific mass shooting today,"" Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said at a news conference later in the evening.
Video footage taken by an onlooker and posted to social media shows two bodies lying in the grocery store parking lot, before the person with the camera walks inside and films a third body lying there, as three shots are heard in the background.
The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, Local 7, which represents 32 employees at the King Soopers outlet, expressed gratitude to emergency responders, customers and staffers who ""acted swiftly to prevent even greater loss of life.""
""There are news reports that after gunshots rang out, grocery workers helped customers in the store find safety, directing shoppers to an exit at the back of the store, and assisted one another to escape the danger inside,"" the statement said.

The Table Mesa area of Boulder where the shooting occurred is home to a residential neighborhood and the hilltop laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
Police declined to say what kind of weapon was used, but the Denver Post reported that initial 911-emergency calls described the suspect's firearms as a ""patrol rifle.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - A policy adviser who filed a sexual assault complaint and was later fired by the U.N. agency fighting AIDS has lost an appeal against her dismissal for misconduct and been refused a copy of an investigation into her alleged assault, documents show.
Martina Brostrom, 41, from Sweden, was fired for sexual and financial misconduct in December 2019. She denies the charges and says her dismissal was in retaliation for reporting a sexual assault by a senior official at UNAIDS.
In response to her appeal, the Global Board of Appeal of the World Health Organization (WHO), which oversees UNAIDS, said in an internal document on Jan. 18: ""The Panel concluded that the misconduct of the Appellant was established and did not find an error of fact or law in the findings of misconduct.""
The document, which has been reviewed by Reuters, also said that Brostrom's dismissal was ""proportional"" in a case of serious misconduct and there was no evidence of bias, prejudice or retaliation against her.
In a separate document last month, UNAIDS called a request by Brostrom for a copy of a report into her alleged sexual assault ""premature"" since a final decision on whether to share the report had not yet been taken by the UNAIDS' Executive Director Winnie Byanyima.
Then-UNAIDS Deputy Executive Director Luiz Loures denies Brostrom's accusation that he groped her in a hotel elevator in Thailand in 2015 and tried to drag her towards his room as well as her allegation that he triggered Brostrom's misconduct probe. Brostrom went public with her assault complaint in 2018.
""I am appalled that they reject any link between my harassment claim and my dismissal and that they refused to provide me with a copy of the report of the investigation,"" Brostrom told Reuters. ""I feel fooled by the system.""
Asked about the content of the documents, which have not been made public, UNAIDS spokeswoman Sophie Barton-Knott declined to comment, citing confidentiality.
Loures did not respond to requests for comment.

Brostrom said she would appeal to a tribunal at the International Labour Organization which examines U.N. staff complaints.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian police said on Tuesday that they had found nothing criminal in the transfer of A$9.5 million ($7.3 million) from the Vatican to Australia between 2014 and 2020.
Financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC scrutinised the transactions after Italian media reported in September that large sums of money had been sent to Australia during the trial of former Vatican treasurer Cardinal George Pell, who had faced charges of historical child sexual assault.
There was speculation in the media that some of the funds were sent to cover Pell's legal costs or that some was sent by a rival in the Vatican to help build cases against him.
Pell was acquitted by Australia's High Court last April after serving 13 months in jail on charges he assaulted two choirboys. He returned to Rome last September.
After reviewing data provided by AUSTRAC, the Australian Federal Police said nothing illegal had been uncovered related to the transactions.
""No criminal misconduct has been identified,"" a spokeswoman for the police said in emailed comments, without elaborating on how the funds were used.
AUSTRAC had originally put the sum transferred at A$2.3 billion, but slashed its estimate to a fraction of that amount after a shocked Vatican called for the watchdog to check its calculations. 
AUSTRAC blamed its miscalculation on complexities and inconsistencies in data it had received from international institutions.

Philippine officials reported about 220 vessels, believed to be manned by Chinese maritime militia personnel, were seen anchored at the Whitsun Reef, which Manila calls the Julian Felipe Reef, on March 7.
The Chinese Embassy in Manila said on Monday the boats spotted were fishing vessels and were taking shelter due to rough sea conditions. 
""The continued deployment, lingering presence and activities of Chinese vessels infringe upon Philippine sovereignty,"" the Philippine foreign ministry said in a diplomatic protest, adding ""their swarming and threatening presence creates an atmosphere of instability."" 
The Chinese Embassy in Manila rejected the accusations. 
""There is no Chinese maritime militia as alleged. Any speculation as such helps nothing but causes unnecessary irritation,"" it said in a statement.
Philippines Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the presence of militia boats was a ""clear provocative action of militarising the area"" and urged China to recall the vessels.
The U.S. Embassy in Manila said the Chinese boats had been mooring in the area for many months in increasing numbers, regardless of the weather, and accused China of using its maritime militia to ""intimidate, provoke and threaten other nations."" 
An international tribunal invalidated China's claim to 90% of the South China Sea in 2016, but Beijing does not recognise the ruling and has built islands in the disputed waters equipped with radar, missiles batteries and hangers for fighter jets.
Jay Batongbacal, an expert on the South China Sea at the University of the Philippines, said President Rodrigo Duterte's ""friendship policy"" to move away from Washington and align more closely with China was to blame for the incursions. 
""Whatever opportunities there were for us to slow them down or stop them they have been lost,"" Batongbacal said. 

China claims almost all of the energy-rich South China Sea, which is also a major trade route. The Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan have overlapping claims.

The shooting in Boulder, Colorado, left nine other people dead while a suspect injured in the violence was arrested, authorities told a news conference late on Monday. Officer Eric Talley was the first on the scene, Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold said, lauding his intervention as ""heroic.""
Talley, 51, had joined the police just over a decade ago and had been looking to eventually find a new line of work, his father Homer said in a statement issued to local media.
""He was looking for a job to keep himself off of the front lines and was learning to be a drone operator. He didn't want to put his family through something like this,"" Homer Talley said.
""He had seven children. The youngest is seven-years-old. He loved his kids and his family more than anything.""
Amid an outpouring of grief, a man named Jeremy Herko who said he'd met Talley at ""the academy,"" described him as one of his best friends.
""He was a devout Christian, he had to buy a 15-passenger van to haul all his kids around, and he was the nicest guy in the world,"" Herko wrote in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
The Boulder Police Department tweeted a photo of Talley in uniform. ""Rest In peace Officer Eric Talley. Your service will never be forgotten,"" the department said.
Talley was featured in a 2013 article as one of three police officers who helped save ducks stuck in a drainage ditch.
He waded into calf-deep water to rescue the ducks from the pipes, according to the article in the Boulder Daily Camera newspaper.
Talley is the sixth on-duty death in the Boulder Police Department's history and the first officer killed in the line of duty since 1994, the Boulder Daily Camera reported.
""He was, by all accounts, one of the outstanding officers at the Boulder Police Department and his life was cut far too short,"" said Michael Dougherty, the Boulder County district attorney.

The bloodshed in Boulder marked the second deadly U.S. mass shooting in a week, following gun violence last week that left eight people dead in the wider Atlanta area. A 21-year-old man has been charged with those killings.

102,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 01:20AM ET</span>",Explainer: Israel's election: array of contenders seek to topple Netanyahu,"By Maayan Lubell
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israelis began voting in their fourth election in two years on Tuesday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hopes the country's world-leading coronavirus vaccine rollout will finally push him through an era of unprecedented political paralysis and into a stable majority.
But Netanyahu, the dominant politician of his generation, is a polarising figure in Israel. And for the first time challengers from across the political spectrum are vying to end the long reign of ""King Bibi"".
FOUR ELECTIONS? WHAT'S THIS ONE ABOUT?
The same as the last three, plus coronavirus.
Netanyahu, 71, is running under the cloud of corruption allegations, which he denies. His trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust has already begun and is expected to resume in April.
On top of that, Israel's economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, and public anger mounted over Netanyahu's handling of the crisis, until the vaccinations began in December.
Netanyahu's new slogan is ""Vaccination Nation"" and he says he is the only one who could have achieved such a fast inoculation programme.
Israel's longest-serving leader has also trumpeted Israel's diplomatic breakthroughs since August with Gulf countries, Morocco and Sudan, all brokered by the United States.
WHAT DO THE OPINION POLLS SAY?
No clear winner.
Netanyahu's right-wing Likud is expected to emerge as the biggest party, but falling short of a majority in the 120-seat Knesset (parliament) and unable to easily form a coalition government - similar to the three previous elections. 
While surveys show a small majority of Israelis want to see Netanyahu out of office, the fragmented opposition also has no clear path to power, with no single agreed candidate to lead the anti-Netanyahu camp. 
Voting started at 7 a.m. and Israel's three main TV stations air exit polls at 10 p.m. (2000 GMT) on Tuesday. Actual results will begin trickling in overnight into Wednesday but final results are expected around Friday. Results have often differed from exit polls. 
WHO ARE NETANYAHU'S RIVALS?
In the past three elections Netanyahu's rivals came from the left. This time around he faces a new challenge from right-wing contenders as well. 
YAIR LAPID, 57, a former finance minister and TV host, who leads the centre-left party Yesh Atid - ""There is a Future"". His party, currently in opposition, is predicted to come in second after Likud. 
GIDEON SAAR, 54, a former cabinet minister who quit Likud to set up the New Hope (OTC:NHPEF) party, vowing to end Netanyahu's reign. Like Likud, his party opposes Palestinian statehood, though Saar's campaign has centred on clean government and jump-starting the economy. 
NAFTALI BENNETT, 48, a former Netanyahu aide, cabinet minister and hi-tech millionaire who heads the ultra-hawkish Yamina party and is vying with Saar to be the next leader of the Israeli right. Positioning himself as a potential king-maker, Bennett has refused to commit to an anti-Netanyahu alliance or to the pro-Netanyahu camp, neither of which could form a government without his backing, according to the polls. 

BENNY GANTZ, 61, a former general whose Blue and White party was torn apart after he joined Netanyahu in a coalition. He argued the need for a national unity government, but many of his centrist supporters were furious. His popularity plunged and polls show his party may not win any seats.

Officials from Mexico's National Migration Institute (INM) and the Foreign Ministry toured the airport's immigration facilities with consulate officials from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay, the government said in a statement. 
Mexican officials heard questions and concerns from the foreign representatives about the ""inadmission"" of nationals from their countries, the statement said. The officials reviewed the hygienic conditions, ventilation and safety of the facilities. 
The tour endorsed Mexico's commitment to resolve the ""problems that some foreigners have faced when going through the immigration filters of the AICM,"" the government said, referring to the airport by its acronym. It did not give further details.

The statement came as Mexico plans to beef up border enforcement along its southern reaches to stem a sharp increase in migrants illegally entering the country to head for the United States.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department said on Monday it is in settlement talks with California to resolve a 2019 lawsuit filed by the state after the Trump administration canceled a nearly $1 billion federal grant for a high-speed rail project hobbled by extensive delays.
California's lawsuit claimed the U.S. Transportation Department lacked legal authority to withhold the $929 million the Obama administration allocated nearly a decade ago but had remained untapped. 
The Justice Department and the California Attorney General's Office said in a joint court filing they had ""engaged in initial settlement discussions and exchanged settlement correspondence"" and asked the case be put on hold during talks to resolve the matter.
A spokeswoman for California's High-Speed Rail authority confirmed the talks.
California says the train system will travel from San Francisco to the Los Angeles basin at speeds capable of over 200 miles per hour (322 kph) by 2033 and eventually extend to the state capital, Sacramento, and San Diego.
The Trump administration agreed not to shift California's grant to another project, pending resolution of the lawsuit. The Federal Railroad Administration under Republican President Donald Trump said California had “failed to make reasonable progress on the project.""
California argued the cancellation stemmed from Trump's ""overt hostility to California.""
Trump ridiculed the project. By contrast, Democratic President Joe Biden strongly supports high-speed rail and has vowed to ensure the United States ""has the cleanest, safest, and fastest rail system in the world.""
California voters approved the initial $10 billion bond for the project in 2008, and $3.5 billion in federal money was allocated two years later. California previously received $2.5 billion of the award.
By March 2018, total costs projected by the state had jumped to $77 billion, with analysts warning the tally could ultimately exceed $98 billion.
California said in February it plans to initially build a single track in the initial 171-mile (275-km) Merced 

to Bakersfield segment in order to validate the system. It plans to later build a second track.
The system's current cost estimate ranges from $69 billion to $99.8 billion and aims to be completed in the 2030s.

Hundreds of people clutching candles held a rally in the Ahlone district of the country's commercial hub of Yangon on Monday night, photographs on social media showed.
At least 261 people have been killed by security forces attempting to quell weeks of pro-democracy protests in towns and cities across the country, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group.
Three people were killed in Myanmar's second city, Mandalay in unrest on Monday, including a 15-year-old boy, witnesses and news reports said.
Security forces staged more raids in parts of Yangon on Monday night with shots fired and some people wounded, the Mizzima news service reported. 
The junta has tried to justify the coup by saying a Nov. 8 election won by Aung San Suu Kyi's party was fraudulent - an accusation the electoral commission rejected. Military leaders have promised a new election but have not set a date and have declared a state of emergency. 
Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her campaign to bring democratic civilian rule to Myanmar, is being held in detention while an array of accusations have been levelled at her, including bribery. Her lawyer says the charges are trumped up. 
There were also more examples of demonstrations overnight staged without people in a bid to avoid becoming targeted by security forces trying to stamp out organised rallies. 
In Hsipaw in Shan State the names of dead protesters written on cards were laid out next to candles with a sign reading ""We spirits don’t want the junta"", DVB TV News reported.
Elsewhere, helium-filled balloons were released on Monday bearing messages calling for international help. Street protesters were replaced by toy cars or dolls, some led by cardboard cutouts or manikins dressed in outfits.
GERMANY SAYS REPRESSION ""UNBEARABLE""
The European Union imposed on Monday sanctions against individuals involved in the coup and the repression of the demonstrators, marking the bloc's most significant response since the overthrow of Suu Kyi's elected government on Feb. 1.
The 11 targeted included General Min Aung Hlaing, the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar military and head of the junta that has taken power.
The EU already has an arms embargo on Myanmar and has targeted some senior military officials since 2018.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters before the meeting that the military repression ""has reached an unbearable extent"". 
Stronger measures are expected soon as the bloc moves to take aim at the businesses run by the military, EU diplomats said. 
Washington had already sanctioned Min Aung Hlaing and the measures announced on Monday expanded the list.
The U.S. action targeted senior policeman Than Hlaing and military officer Aung Soe, as well as two Burmese Army divisions, the 33rd Light Infantry and 77th Light Infantry.
U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said members of the 33rd Division had fired live rounds into a crowd in Mandalay. Both units were part of the security forces' ""planned systemic strategies to ramp up the use of lethal force"", he said.
There was no immediate response from the junta, which has shown no sign so far of being swayed by international condemnation of its actions.
The junta spokesman is scheduled to hold a news conference on Tuesday afternoon.
Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan will visit Malaysia on Tuesday after stopping in Brunei Darussalam on Monday and before heading to Indonesia later this week. 

Malaysia and Indonesia are seeking an urgent high-level meeting of Southeast Asia's ASEAN regional grouping, of which Myanmar is a member, to discuss the crisis.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday acknowledged mounting dissatisfaction with his handling of a series of allegations about the mistreatment of women in politics, as he vowed to drive cultural change.
Morrison's comments came just hours after The Australian newspaper and Channel 10 reported allegations and images from an anonymous whistleblower about lewd behaviour by male government staff in Parliament House.
They included the men filming themselves performing solo sex acts, including on the desk of a female Member of Parliament.
One government staff member has been removed from his position, a government minister said on Tuesday. 
Morrison described the report as ""disgusting"" and said he would speak with all government staff members on Tuesday to remind them of their responsibilities.
The ruling Liberal/National coalition has come under sustained pressure in recent weeks following allegations of rape by a Liberal party staff member, including one in the office of a Cabinet minister.
The issue spurred tens of thousands of people to rally around Australia last week and led to a slump in Morrison's standing in opinion polls.
Morrison has sought to defend his government's actions in working to improve gender equality, but on Tuesday he accepted there was broad dissatisfaction.
""I acknowledge that many Australians, especially women, believe that I have not heard them, and that greatly distresses me,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra.
""We must do better... we must get this house in order.""

However, he offered few concrete proposals to improve the workplace culture in parliament, insisting that changes would be announced in the coming weeks.

The staunch conservative launched his campaign at a rally in Huntsville, Alabama, where he was joined by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller.
Brooks previously said he had spoken to Trump about a possible Senate run. An endorsement from Trump, who easily won Alabama over President Joe Biden in November's presidential election, would likely make Brooks the favorite in the race to replace the retiring Republican Senator Richard Shelby, 86. 
Miller, the chief architect of Trump's hardline anti-immigration policies, has ties to Alabama, having served as a top adviser to the state's longtime former U.S. senator, Jeff Sessions.
Brooks, 66, backed Trump's false claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election and spoke at a Trump rally that preceded the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot, when violent Trump supporters stormed Congress in an attempt to overturn Biden's victory. The violence, which left five people dead, led to Trump's second impeachment in the House of Representatives and acquittal in the Senate. 
At Monday's rally, Brooks again asserted that Trump was the victim of fraud, claiming that the 2020 contest saw the ""worst voter fraud and election theft in history.""
Election officials and judges in multiple states found no evidence of major improprieties.
After encouraging ""patriots"" at the Trump rally to start ""taking down names and kicking ass,"" Brooks was named in a federal lawsuit brought by Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell. Swalwell, who helped prosecute the impeachment case against Trump, is seeking financial damages for the injury and destruction caused by the riot.
Brooks' opponents for the Republican nomination include Lynda Blanchard, who served as Trump's ambassador to Slovenia. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill is also seen as a potential Republican contender. On the Democratic side, U.S. Representative Terri Sewell has expressed interest in mounting a Senate bid.
Brooks ran unsuccessfully in a special Senate election in 2017, losing the Republican nomination to Roy Moore. Moore's campaign imploded following multiple sexual misconduct allegations, which he denied, and Democrat Doug Jones eventually won in an upset.

Jones lost his re-election campaign last year to former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville, a staunch Trump loyalist.

The photos were released on Monday and were provided to Reuters by Texas Democratic Representative Henry Cuellar, whose office said they were taken over the weekend.
In one of the first major challenges of his presidency, U.S. President Joe Biden is trying to contain a burgeoning humanitarian crisis along the southwest U.S. border with Mexico.
A sharp rise in the number of migrants fleeing violence, natural disasters, and economic hardship in Central America is testing Biden's commitment to a more humane immigration policy than that of his predecessor, Donald Trump. Hopes of a less hardline response from the U.S. government has encouraged some migrants to make the journey north.
U.S. officials are struggling to house and process an increasing number of unaccompanied children, many of whom have been stuck in border stations for days while they await placement in overwhelmed government-run shelters.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said last month it was opening the temporary facility in Donna to provide processing capacity for the heavily trafficked Rio Grande Valley sector while a permanent center in McAllen was being renovated. It said at the time that the Donna facility was expected to provide ample areas for eating and sleeping.
In one photo, people of all ages, including children, are shown sitting on the floor. With the coronavirus pandemic still raging, all appear to be wearing masks but they are crowded close together.
In others, rows of people are seen lying down next to each other on mats and covered in emergency blankets.

With Britain suffering one of the highest death tolls from the coronavirus, Johnson has come under fire for moving too slowly last year to tackle the first and second waves of the pandemic, with some accusing him of prioritising the economy over health.
But since then, his government has overseen a successful vaccine rollout, reaching more than half of the adult population, and a cautious approach to easing the latest lockdown, prompting a recovery for him in opinion polls.
""Today, the anniversary of the first lockdown, is an opportunity to reflect on the past year – one of the most difficult in our country's history,"" Johnson said in a statement.
""We should also remember the great spirit shown by our nation over this past year. ... It's because of every person in this country that lives have been saved, our NHS (National Health Service) was protected, and we have started on our cautious road to easing restrictions once and for all.""

Last month, he unveiled a roadmap to ease England's lockdown, starting with the reopening of schools two weeks ago and ending on June 21 at the earliest when most of the restrictions will be lifted.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate on Monday confirmed former union leader Marty Walsh, a son of Irish immigrants, as the next labor secretary, boosting Biden's efforts to expand workers' protection and delivering a win for the country's organized labor movement.
His confirmation, by a 68-29 margin on Monday evening, is likely to have a major impact on U.S. workplace laws and regulations, including vigorous enforcement of occupational safety and health rules, overtime payments and proper administration of employee benefit plans.
Walsh, 53, led Boston's Building and Construction Trades Council for two years before winning the 2013 race for mayor with strong backing from large labor groups. He has also served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.
Walsh has supported key proposals affecting workers, including a $15 minimum wage, paid family leave and the PRO Act - a proposal to update labor laws and give workers more ability to organize at work that the House of Representatives passed last year.
""When I was running for Mayor, I was kind of put in a box saying he's only going to be a labor person, he's not going to be worried about business,"" Walsh told reporters on Monday. 
""I think we've proven over the last seven years that we can work across the aisle and get things done while also protecting the worker and I hope to do some of that same stuff in Washington,"" he said.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supported Walsh in a letter to the Senate last week.

Walsh was the last of Biden's cabinet secretaries to be confirmed by the Senate, though two other cabinet-level positions remain to be confirmed.
""It's difficult to overstate the importance of this moment...we will be stronger with Secretary Walsh in the fight ahead,"" said AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.

The U.S. Justice Department said Mun Chol Myong, who it said was affiliated with North Korea's primary intelligence organization, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, was the first North Korean ever extradited to the United States.
It said Mun appeared in federal court in Washington, where he was indicted in May 2019 on six counts of money laundering, including conspiracy to commit money laundering. 
Mun was arrested in Malaysia in 2019 after the United States accused him of laundering funds through front companies and issuing fraudulent documents to support illicit shipments to North Korea. He denied the allegations, saying they were politically motivated. 
His lawyer, public defender Michelle Peterson, declined to comment on the indictment, which was unsealed on Monday. 
North Korea said on Friday it would sever diplomatic relations with Malaysia after the extradition.
It called it a ""nefarious act and unpardonably heavy crime"" by Malaysian authorities, who had ""offered our citizen as a sacrifice of the U.S. hostile move in defiance of the acknowledged international laws.""
North Korea warned that Washington, ""the backstage manipulator and main culprit of this incident,"" would be ""made to pay a due price.""
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week the Biden administration would complete a review of U.S. policy toward North Korea in the next few weeks.
The court papers indicated U.S. authorities had indicted others in the case, including ""Chinese co-conspirator"" companies and individuals whose names were redacted.
The indictment said Mun had relocated to Malaysia from Singapore, where he had been employed by a firm called Sinsar Trading, which procured sanctioned luxury goods like liquor and tobacco.
It valued his alleged money-laundering transactions at over $1.5 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday rejected Ghislaine Maxwell's third request for bail, after the British socialite had offered to renounce her British and French citizenships if she were freed.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan said Maxwell remained a ""significant risk of flight"" and that no conditions, including her proposed $28.5 million bail package, would reasonably assure she would show up in court.
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to charges she helped the financier Jeffrey Epstein recruit and groom three teenage girls for sex between 1994 and 1997, and lied about her role.
She has been held in a Brooklyn jail since her arrest last July, which came 11 months after Epstein died in his Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
Lawyers for Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
After Nathan rejected two prior bail requests, Maxwell on Feb. 23 offered to renounce her non-U.S. citizenships, and move most of her and her husband's assets into an account to be monitored by a retired federal judge.
Her lawyers said Maxwell wanted to defend herself at trial, and the new conditions should assuage concern she might seek a ""safe haven"" in the United Kingdom or France.
But the judge said Maxwell could still resist extradition if she fled, and even with the monitor still had access to ""sufficient"" assets to help her evade prosecution.
Nathan is also considering 12 motions by Maxwell to dismiss, narrow or weaken the government's criminal case.
Maxwell has said the government targeted her only because Epstein killed himself and prosecutors wanted someone else to blame, and that she was covered by Epstein's own 2008 non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors in Florida.

The case is U.S. v. Maxwell, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-cr-00330.

Prosecutors said Geovanny Fuentes Ramirez, who was arrested in Miami in March 2020, smuggled drugs into the United States with the help of Hernandez, who has been president since 2014.
The verdict is the latest case to allege Hernandez has been involved in drug trafficking to the United States, despite millions in U.S. security assistance to Honduras, which prosecutors during the trial called a ""narco-state.""
""Juan Orlando Hernandez didn't just want the defendant's cash, he wanted access to the defendant's cocaine,"" assistant U.S. attorney Michael Lockard said, referring to a cocaine lab Fuentes was said to have controlled in Honduras.
An accountant at the firm where Hernandez and Fuentes were said to have met said he saw Fuentes pay Hernandez $25,000 in bribes for access to the cocaine lab and protection. A Honduran drug gang boss also testified to paying bribes to Hernandez.
Hernandez denies any wrongdoing, saying captured traffickers have faked evidence to smear him and reduce their sentences.
Any narrative omitting the ""95%"" drop in drug trafficking his government had achieved was just ""false testimony by narcos we defeated,"" Hernandez said on Twitter after the verdict.
The U.S. Justice Department, which does not typically pursue serving foreign leaders, has not charged Hernandez with a crime. 
U.S. prosecutors are seeking life in prison for his brother, Tony Hernandez, a former Honduran congressman convicted of drug trafficking in 2019. They allege President Hernandez was a party to his brother's ""state-sponsored drug trafficking conspiracy.""

The latest allegation against Hernandez could complicate efforts by the Biden administration to address the causes of migration from Central America, including Honduras.

While the U.N. statement does not single out any countries, it comes after a shooting in Atlanta earlier this month left eight people dead, six of them Asian-American women.
The shooting stoked fears among those in the Asian-American Pacific Islander community, which has reported a spike in hate crimes since March 2020 when then-President Donald Trump began referring to COVID-19 as the ""China virus.""
""The world has witnessed horrific deadly attacks, verbal and physical harassment, bullying in schools, workplace discrimination, incitement to hatred in the media and on social media platforms, and incendiary language by those in positions of power,"" U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said. 
""In some countries, Asian women have been specifically targeted for attack, adding misogyny to the toxic mix of hatred,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Sidney Powell, a lawyer who advised President Donald Trump's campaign, asked a judge on Monday to throw out a $1.3 billion lawsuit accusing her of spreading false conspiracy theories about the November presidential election.
Powell said in a filing in federal court in Washington that there was a ""no basis"" for the lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems Inc in January.
Powell, represented by three lawyers, argued that claims she made about Denver-based Dominion were protected by the right to free speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
She said her claims about Dominion were meant to be hyperbolic, and that ""reasonable people would not accept such statements as fact but view them only as claims that await testing by the courts through the adversary process.""
Powell, appearing with longtime Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, charged without evidence at a November news conference that Dominion’s electronic voting systems had switched millions of ballots to Democrat Joe Biden.
In later media appearances, Powell falsely claimed that Dominion was created in Venezuela to rig elections for that country’s late president, Hugo Chavez, and that Dominion bribed Georgia officials for a no-bid contract.
“Powell’s wild accusations are demonstrably false,” Dominion’s lawyers said in their lawsuit.
Trump referred to Powell as one of his “wonderful lawyers and representatives” in a Nov. 14 tweet.
Giuliani and another Trump legal adviser, Jenna Ellis, later distanced themselves from Powell, saying in a statement released by the campaign that Powell ""is not a member of the Trump Legal Team.""
Dominion has a similar lawsuit pending against Giuliani, which also seeks $1.3 billion in damages. He has also said his remarks were constitutionally protected speech.

For two months after losing his re-election bid to Biden, Trump loudly argued that he lost due to rampant electoral fraud, claims that were rejected by multiple courts and state election officials.

In a brief statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account, Uganda Police said it had arrested the American, Guy Smith, in a town in the country's west on Sunday.
He was detained ""for his alleged involvement in anti government subversive activities. He remains in custody at...as inquiries continue. Any new information will be communicated accordingly,"" the statement said.
Police gave no further details. 
In an email, a U.S. State Department official said the government was aware of the arrest but did not provide details. 
""We have seen reports of a detained U.S. citizen in Uganda.  Whenever a U.S. citizen is detained overseas, we stand ready to provide all appropriate consular services.""
Museveni, 76, who has ruled the east African country since 1986, faces an invigorated opposition led by pop star and lawmaker Bobi Wine whose energy and music have galvanised support from the country's youth.
Wine, 39, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, rejected results of the Jan. 14 presidential elections that declared he had lost to Museveni, saying he won but Museveni stole the election using ballot stuffing, intimidation, falsification of tally sheets and other tactics. 
Wine has urged supporters to stage protests and assert his victory although during the government crackdown on opponents, his calls have gone largely unheeded. 
Museveni, in speeches, has depicted Wine as a puppet of foreign interests, including homosexuals although he has not provided proof.
In recent months security personnel have detained hundreds of Wine's supporters. Some were released after being tortured while others remain in custody. At least 54 people were killed in November as police and the military battled to quell an opposition protest.

    Kurti, 46, a leftist and an Albanian nationalist, whose coalition secured 67 votes in the 120-seat parliament, said its main priorities will be the fight against corruption and the creation of jobs in a country with the youngest population in Europe and unemployment of around 30%.
If it wants to join the European Union, Kosovo must also improve relations with neighbouring Serbia, which is a candidate for membership in the bloc.
    Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, but Belgrade, backed by Russia, China, and some EU members, refuses to recognise it.

    “If Serbia does not recognise an independent Kosovo there cannot be a normalisation of relations,” Kurti said.
    Serbia lost control of Kosovo, its former southern province, in 1999 after NATO bombing campaign forced it to end a bloody counter-insurgency against Kosovo Albanians.
Authorities in Pristina are struggling to contain the COVID-19 epidemic and Kurti said his government wants to have 60% of Kosovo's 1.8 million population vaccinated by the end of 2021.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A judge in West Virginia ordered U.S. Capitol riots suspect George Pierre Tanios detained on charges he conspired with a friend to assault three police officers with chemical spray, including one officer who later died.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael John Aloi lamented a ""culture, radicalized by hate"" that played out at the Capitol on Jan. 6 during a peaceful transition of power.
""We all witnessed it as Americans: Forcing yourself against law enforcement officials that had nothing but bike racks,"" Aloi said. ""Why wouldn't you just turn the other way and go home? The fact that all of them weren't thinking that - it's just frightening to me.""
Hundreds have been charged with taking part in an attack that led to five deaths after a mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the building https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2BB1RL in a failed bid to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election victory. 
In an emotional court hearing that featured testimony from Tanios' family, prosecutors presented evidence that Tanios had purchased the bear and pepper sprays which he later brought with him to the Capitol. One of the sprays was used by his friend to spray police, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors also said they had reason to believe that Tanios' mother would try to help her son flee the country to her native Lebanon if he is released from custody. The mother denied the claim in court.
Tanios of Morgantown, West Virginia, and a friend, Julian Elie Khater, of State College, Pennsylvania, are facing multiple criminal counts, including assaulting police with a deadly weapon and obstructing an official proceeding.
Khater and Tanios are not charged with killing the officer, Brian Sicknick. His cause of death remains unclear. 
Prosecutor Sarah Wagner told the judge that Tanios' co-defendant admitted to the FBI in an interview that he had traveled with his friend to attend Trump's ""Stop the Steal"" rally on Jan. 6 and shared a hotel room.
Both Khater and the manager of a store in West Virginia that sells guns and other weapons confirmed that Tanios had purchased cans of both bear spray and pepper spray to bring to Washington after he was told he could not bring firearms or a pepper ball gun into the city, Wagner told the court.
Although she said the evidence suggests Khater, 32, and not Tanios, did the actual spraying, he assisted with the ""purchasing"" and the ""planning"" of the sprays.
She also showed body camera and open source videos, including one featuring Sicknick shortly after he had been sprayed with a chemical irritant.
In the video, which Wagner also described for the court, he ""appears to be attempting to walk off the effects of the pepper spray, rinsing his eyes with more water and pausing at times, while crouched over with his hands on his knees."" 
Tanios' mother, Maguy Tanios, told the court in tears that she had escaped war-torn Lebanon to start a new life after several of her family members were killed.
She said her son, who is 39, goes to church and is a family man who has three small children. ""My son is not a bad kid,"" she said, and explained his role at the U.S. Capitol as him being ""in the wrong place at the wrong time.""
Tanios' attorney Elizabeth Gross said the evidence presented against him in favor of detention was ""minimal"" and ""limited.""
The Justice Department has charged more than 400 people in the Capitol attack, a prosecutor told ""60 Minutes"" https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2BE057 in an interview that aired on Sunday. Hundreds are accused of trespassing and more than 100 accused of assaulting officers.
About two dozen members of far-right militias are facing conspiracy charges that carry particularly severe sentences.

Prosecutors are preparing to start plea discussions as early as this week, the Washington Post reported on Monday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Monday it was imposing sanctions on two members of Myanmar's ruling junta, including the chief of police, and two military units linked to the deadly repression of protests again the army's coup, as Washington warned of more action.
President Joe Biden's administration has already blacklisted top junta members and some military-owned companies, but the military has refused to change course and increasingly used violence against anti-coup demonstrators, killing more than 250 people so far. 
""Today's actions send a strong signal that we will follow through on our pledges to continue to take action against coup leaders and those who perpetrate violence,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.
The U.S. action came on the heels of the European Union imposing its own sanctions on Monday on 11 individuals linked to the Feb. 1 coup in Myanmar.
The U.S. Treasury's action targeted Than Hlaing, a military officer who was appointed to lead the police force after the coup, and Lieutenant General Aung Soe, a special operations commander overseeing the crackdown.
The move essentially freezes any U.S. assets of those blacklisted and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.
The Treasury also blacklisted the army's 77th Light Infantry Division and 33rd Light Infantry Division, which have been deployed to suppress anti-coup demonstrations in the largest city, Yangon, and second city of Mandalay.
""Video footage shows security forces riding pickup trucks while apparently indiscriminately firing live ammunition in multiple directions, including into people's homes,"" the Treasury said of the crackdowns. 
The 33rd was one of two of the army's elite light infantry units already under U.S. human rights sanctions for their roles in the military's 2017 assault on Rohingya Muslims, which were first detailed in a Reuters special report.

Britain has repeatedly denounced torture, forced labour and sterilisations that it says are taking place against Muslim Uighurs on an ""industrial scale"" in Xinjiang and repeated its criticism on Monday.

Sullivan, speaking in an interview on MSNBC, did not give an exact date for the U.S.-China meeting on climate issues. But the two will be speaking on Tuesday at a ministerial meeting on climate action hosted by the EU, Canada and China.
The meeting will come after top Chinese and U.S. diplomats held their first meeting of Joe Biden’s presidency last Thursday and Friday in Alaska and publicly rebuked each other’s policies.
The Chinese delegation said after the meeting that the two sides were “committed to enhancing communication and cooperation in the field of climate change,” Xinhua news agency said on Saturday, and would set up a joint working group on climate change.

WARSAW (Reuters) - When Polish doctors told Paulina, 29, that her unborn child had no kidneys and would die upon birth, she knew she couldn't go through with the pregnancy. 
""Everyone says that the reward after the pain of birth is holding your child in your hands,"" said Paulina, a retail manager from Gdynia, who asked Reuters to withhold her surname. 
""I would have nothing. I would give birth to a dead child, and that pain would be a thousand times worse.""
Until two months ago, women like Paulina still stood a chance of being allowed an abortion in Poland. However, in a ruling that came into effect in January, the constitutional court decided that terminating pregnancies due to foetal abnormalities was no longer legal, effectively imposing a near-total ban on abortions.
Polish law now considers only incest, rape or a threat to a mother's life and health as valid grounds to terminate a pregnancy.
Poland's ruling nationalists supported the move but the country was rocked by weeks of nationwide protests following the Oct. 22 ruling, which quickly morphed into an outpouring of anger against the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government and the powerful Catholic Church.
Paulina's only option, therefore, was to find a doctor willing to attest that giving birth was a threat to her health. 
Two weeks after Paulina learned of her baby's condition, abortion rights activists helped her to find a psychiatrist prepared to state that she needed to have an abortion on mental health grounds, and her abortion went ahead. 
This makes her one of perhaps only around a dozen women who has managed to get an abortion on such grounds since the ruling came into effect, abortion support groups told Reuters. 
Several doctors and lawyers Reuters spoke to maintain that abortions on mental health grounds are in keeping with the law, but government officials and conservative groups call this into question.
Poland's Ministry of Health told Reuters in an emailed statement that a qualified medical specialist in the appropriate field should determine if a pregnancy threatens the life or health of the mother, depending on the woman's illness.
It did not say if it considered a threat to mental health as sufficient grounds for an abortion. 
""I've seen opinions like, 'I'm anxious and I don't want to give birth',"" Michal Wojcik, a government minister and member of the socially conservative United Poland grouping allied with the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, told Reuters. 
""I don't think we should count such instances, which are there to simply go around the rules."" 
A lawyer for Ordo Iuris, a campaign group that champions ultra-conservative and religious causes, also told Reuters that, in her opinion, giving a recommendation on the basis of mental health was illegal.
ABORTION ACCESS SHRINKING
Some women have chosen to get abortions abroad, despite the coronavirus pandemic and the associated travel restrictions. Paulina was initially told she should go to the Netherlands, a trip she was afraid to do alone.
According to abortion support groups, several women are waiting to find a doctor who is willing to help them, of which there are still very few. This is partly out of fear: Under Polish law, women who undergo an illegal abortion face no penalty, while a doctor can be jailed for up to three years. 
In addition, many doctors in Poland, especially in the more conservative southeast, were already exercising their legal right to refuse on religious grounds to terminate pregnancies before the ruling went into force. More are expected to do so now. 
Of the four doctors who agreed to support Paulina's case for an abortion, only one, Aleksandra Krasowska, a Warsaw-based psychiatrist, was willing to be named by Reuters, and confirmed that she had referred Paulina for the termination due to her deteriorating mental health. The other three - a psychiatrist, doctor and a gynecologist - spoke to Reuters anonymously.
""It's important that this isn't a one-person decision ... Then it's easier for all of us, to handle this fear of the prosecutor and of the three years in jail,"" one of the psychiatrists involved told Reuters.
Maciej Socha, a Gdansk-based gynecologist, is one of few doctors willing to argue publicly that a threat to a woman's mental health should be accepted as a grounds for abortion. 
""If a patient has a brain tumour and continuing the pregnancy threatens her life and health, we can end the pregnancy. If a patient has psychiatric reasons ..., then in my opinion, this is enough to end such a pregnancy,"" Socha said.

Paulina believes the doctors who helped her terminate her pregnancy saved her life. ""These people are heroes. That they aren't afraid of the consequences from this sick country that they live in,"" she said.

Lebanon has been without a government since shortly after the Aug. 4 chemical explosion that destroyed the port of Beirut and devastated downtown areas of the capital, killing hundreds of people, injuring thousands and making 300,000 homeless.
The giant blast accelerated the downward spiral of an economy trapped in debt, banking, financial and fiscal crises, while foreign donors refuse to bail out Lebanon until it forms a government of capable technocrats committed to reform. 
Aoun sent a list suggesting different scenarios for a cabinet of either 18,20 or 22 ministers, with names to be filled in, Hariri said. 
""This is unacceptable because it is not the job of the prime minister-designate to fill forms from someone else or of the president to form a government."" 
In a statement read by the presidency spokesperson, Aoun said he was ""surprised"" by Hariri's comments and that his proposal to Hariri had not included a blocking minority.
The lack of agreement came after a hint of a breakthrough on Thursday when the two last met and Hariri had said he saw an opportunity to be seized.
""The current deadlock and dim outlook will certainly have a toll on the exchange rate, making it more difficult for the average worker to get by without food aid,"" said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center. 
The Lebanese pound dropped to over 13,000 to the dollar on the informal market after news of the outcome of the meeting, having traded earlier in the day at around 11,000. 
Lebanon's economic crisis, which is posing the biggest threat to its stability since the 1975-1990 civil war, has seen the Lebanese pound sink by almost 90%, plunging many into poverty. 
As businesses shut down, joblessness and hunger are rising. Lebanon's banks, having lent 70% of their assets to an insolvent state and central bank, have locked most depositors out of their savings.
Hassain Diab's cabinet, which resigned after the Beirut port blast, remains in a caretaker capacity until a successor is formed but fractious politicians have been unable to agree a government since Hariri's nomination in October.
There is no budget and there will soon be no hard currency to pay for imports of subsidised wheat, medicine and fuel.
Under a sectarian power-sharing system, Lebanon's president must be a Maronite Christian and the prime minister a Sunni Muslim. Aoun is an ally of Hezbollah, listed as a terrorist group by the United States.
Veteran Sunni politician Hariri was nominated to form a cabinet of specialists that could enact reforms and unlock foreign aid. 
The Shi'ite Amal movement, headed by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri who backs Hariri, called for it to be formed urgently on Monday.

But Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said on Thursday that even though he would approve a government of technocrats if formed, a cabinet with no politicians would not last long.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia presented a new peace initiative on Monday to end the war in Yemen, including a nationwide ceasefire and the reopening of air and sea links, but its Houthi enemies said the offer did not appear to go far enough to lift a blockade.
The initiative, announced by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, would include reopening Sanaa airport, and allow fuel and food imports through Hodeidah port, both of which are controlled by the Iran-aligned Houthis.
Political negotiations between the Saudi-backed government and the Houthis would be restarted, he told a news conference, It would take effect when the Yemeni sides accepted.
Yemen's internationally recognised government issued a statement welcoming the offer.
But the Houthis said the initiative provided ""nothing new"", as it still fell short of their demand for a complete lifting of the blockade on Sanaa airport and Hodeidah port. 
""We expected that Saudi Arabia would announce an end to the blockade of ports and airports and an initiative to allow in 14 ships that are held by the coalition,"" Houthi chief negotiator Mohammed Abdulsalam told Reuters.
A ""humanitarian right"" should not be used as a pressure tool, he said.
The group would continue to talk with the Saudis, the United States and mediator Oman for a peace agreement, he said.
The war has killed more than 100,000 people, many of them civiilians, according to The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a database that tracks violence in Yemen
The conflict, widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has been stalemated for years and has left 80% of Yemen's population reliant on aid. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression.
Saudi Arabia, which leads a military coalition battling the movement, has been under increasing pressure to put an end to the six-year-old conflict since U.S. President Joe Biden signalled Washington would no longer support the intervention and as the United Nations warns of a looming famine in Yemen. 
The United Nations welcomes the Saudi ""intention to undertake a number of measures to help end the conflict in Yemen"", U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said on Monday, stressing that ""it's still early days"".
Haq said the proposal is aligned with the U.N. initiative and that special envoy Martin Griffiths would now follow up with the warring parties.
MILITARY ESCALATION
Prince Faisal said Riyadh would work with the international community to press the Houthis ""to accept and come to the negotiating table"" and that the Saudi-led coalition would continue to face Houthi assaults ""with the necessary response"".
The movement has stepped up drone and missile attacks on Saudi Arabia, including on oil facilities, and a ground offensive to seize Yemen's gas-rich Marib region. The coalition has responded with air strikes on Houthi military sites.
The Houthis demand the lifting of the blockade, which they blame for what the United Nations describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The Saudi-led coalition and aid agencies have accused the group of obstructing aid efforts. 
The coalition has said the port and airport must be restricted to prevent weapons from reaching the Houthis who control the capital and most populous areas.
Riyadh's announcement did not specify which air routes would be permitted to Sanaa, or whether the imports through Hodeidah port would be subject to additional pre-authorisations.
The United Nations has already set up a mechanism in Djibouti to inspect ships before they dock at Hodeidah port, but coalition warships hold up most vessels despite U.N. clearance.

Prince Faisal said tax revenues from the port would go to a joint bank account in Hodeidah's branch of Yemen's central bank.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India and Pakistan are to hold the first meeting in three years on Tuesday of a commission on water rights from the Indus River in a further sign of rapprochement in relations frozen since 2019 during disputes over Kashmir. 
The Permanent Indus Commission, set up in 1960, will meet for two days in New Delhi, according to two Indian officials involved with water issues and Pakistan's foreign ministry.
Pakistan will raise objections to the technical designs of India's planned Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai hydroelectric plants, Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri said.
The Indus River, one of the world's largest, and its tributaries feed 80 percent of Pakistan's irrigated agriculture. 
The talks are the latest in both nations' tentative efforts to re-engage after a 2019 suicide bomb in Indian Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based guerrillas and India's move later that year to strip Kashmir's constitutional autonomy.
UAE INVOLVED? 
Both nations are now focussed on coping with unprecedented economic downturns due to COVID-19.
Bloomberg news agency and Foreign Policy magazine have reported that the United Arab Emirates, with whom both India and Pakistan have close ties, may have played a role in secret efforts to achieve a detente. 
Last month, India and Pakistan announced a rare agreement to stop firing on the bitterly-contested Kashmir border, which Bloomberg said was also the result of UAE-brokered talks.
There was no immediate comment from India, Pakistan or the UAE to the Bloomberg report out on Monday.
At the water-sharing talks, both sides are expected to try and narrow differences over the hydro-projects, Indian officials said. 
One of the Indian officials, who asked to remain unidentified, said the Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai projects along with a couple of others - which Pakistan is concerned would hurt the flow of water downstream - were in line with the provisions of the treaty.

""We will discuss to allay those objections, we believe in an amicable resolution,"" the official said.

DHAKA (Reuters) - A huge fire swept through a Rohingya refugee camp in southern Bangladesh on Monday, destroying thousands of homes and killing several people, officials and witnesses said, in the worst blaze to hit the settlement in recent years.
Video and photographs showed a blaze ripping through the Balukhali camp in Cox's Bazar. Black smoke billowed over burning shanties and tents as people scrambled to recover their possessions.
""Fire services, rescue and response teams and volunteers are at the scene to try to control the fire and prevent it spreading further,"" said Louise Donovan, spokesperson for U.N. refugee agency UNHCR in Cox's Bazar.
Mohammed Shamsud Douza, the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said authorities were trying to control the blaze.
Rohingya refugees in the camps said many homes were burned down and several people had died, but neither the authorities nor the UNHCR could confirm the number of deaths. The cause of the blaze has not been established.
More than a million Rohingya live in the camps in southern Bangladesh, the vast majority having fled Myanmar in 2017 from a military-led crackdown that U.N. investigators said was executed with ""genocidal intent"", charges Myanmar denies.
Zaifur Hussein, a 50-year-old refugee who escaped the fire but lost his home and was sheltering with friends, said he believed dozens may have been killed and that fencing around the camps made it difficult to flee.
""When we were in Myanmar we faced lots of problems... they destroyed everything,"" he said. ""Now it has happened again.""
Snigdha Chakraborty, the Bangladesh director for Catholic Relief Services, said she was worried about the lack of medical facilities in the area.
""Medical facilities are basic and burns require sophisticated treatment, plus hospital beds are already partly taken up with COVID-19 patients,"" she said. ""Most likely there will be fatalities because the fire is so large.""
A Rohingya leader in Cox's Bazar, a sliver of land bordering Myanmar in southeastern Bangladesh, said he saw several dead bodies.
""Thousand of huts were totally burned down,"" Mohammed Nowkhim told Reuters.
Another large blaze tore through the camp in January, destroying homes but causing no casualties.
The risk of fire in the densely populated camps is high, and Monday's blaze was the largest yet, said Onno Van Manen, Country Director of Save the Children in Bangladesh.
""It is another devastating blow to the Rohingya refugees who live here. Just a couple of days ago we lost one of our health facilities in another fire,"" he said. 

The UNHCR said humanitarian partners had mobilised hundreds of volunteers from nearby camps for the support operation, as well as fire safety vehicles and equipment.

Bulgaria's foreign ministry said it had given the diplomats 72 hours to leave the country following a letter from prosecutors that said the two had been involved in activities incompatible with their status.
""A note has been handed to the deputy chief of mission at the Russian embassy,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Sofia has now expelled eight Russian diplomats, including a military attache, over suspected spying since October 2019, putting a strain on historically close ties between Moscow and Bulgaria, which is a member of NATO and the European Union.
The Russian embassy in Sofia called the move ""groundless"" and said Moscow reserved the right to take retaliatory measures.
Prosecutors have said a suspected spying ring, led by a former senior Bulgarian military intelligence officer, had been passing classified information about Bulgaria, NATO and the EU to the Russian embassy in Sofia. 
NATO SUPPORT
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov by telephone on Monday that the Atlantic alliance should stand united against any malign activities targeting its member states, the government press office said. 
The United States, Britain and North Macedonia have already expressed their support for Bulgaria, and Borissov has called on Russia to stop spying in the Balkan country. 
A Bulgarian military court ruled earlier on Monday to keep in custody five of the six members of the alleged spying ring, whose activities had been under surveillance since the autumn.
One member of the group had cooperated with the prosecutors and they were not seeking his arrest.
Bulgaria was one of the closest allies of the Soviet Union during the Communist era. It maintains close cultural, historical and economic ties with Russia, which remains the country's main energy partner.

The U.S. Treasury Department named the officials as Wang Junzheng, secretary of the Party Committee of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), and Chen Mingguo, director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau (XPSB).
The two were targeted under the U.S. Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, it said, adding that the move complemented actions taken by the European Union, Britain and Canada.
While the actions by the United States and others avoided targeting China's top leadership, it was the first coordinated move under the Biden administration, which took office in January and has vowed to work closely with allies in pushing back against China.
The move follows two days of ""tough and direct"" talks between U.S. and Chinese officials last week in Alaska, which laid bare the depth of tensions between the world's two largest economies at the outset of the Biden administration. 
""Amid growing international condemnation, (China) continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who took part in last week's talks, said in a statement while calling on Beijing to end the repression of Uighurs and other minority groups.
Monday's moves block U.S.-linked assets of the individuals.
Washington imposed sanctions on Xinjiang's Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, a member of China's powerful Politburo, and five other officials in July, when it also targeted the XPSB and the XPCC.
""Chinese authorities will continue to face consequences as long as atrocities occur in Xinjiang,” Andrea Gacki, director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, said in a statement.
""Treasury is committed to promoting accountability for the Chinese government’s human rights abuses, including arbitrary detention and torture, against Uighurs and other ethnic minorities,” she said.
The Treasury statement said the XPSB had used repressive tactics against the Uighurs and members of other ethnic minorities in the region, including mass detentions and surveillance since at least 2016.

""Targets of this surveillance are often detained and reportedly subjected to various methods of torture and political reeducation,"" it said.

The letter, published in newspapers and signed by former central bank chiefs and some of Brazil's richest bankers, underscored a growing revolt by business leaders against the far-right president whom many had backed for his 2018 election.
Without naming Bolsonaro, they upbraided ""the country's highest political leadership"" for ignoring science, encouraging crowds, hyping unproven treatments and ""flirting with the anti-vaccine movement.""
The presidential press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A surge of infections has made Brazil the latest epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, killing more than 15,000 people last week and pushing hospitals across the country to the limit.
Brazil's government is racing to obtain fresh supplies of drugs needed to safely intubate patients, Jarbas Barbosa, assistant director of the Pan American Health Organization, said on Monday, after concerns of shortages arose this month. [L1N2LK1NN]
""We are on the verge of an explosive phase of the pandemic, and it is fundamental that, from now on, public policy be based on data, solid information and scientific evidence,"" wrote the business leaders and economists.
""The country is tired of out-of-place ideas, inconsequential words and late or mistaken actions,"" they said. ""Brazil demands respect.""
Among the signatories were Roberto Setubal and Pedro Moreira Salles, whose families control Itau, Brazil's biggest bank, Pedro Passos, co-founder of cosmetics maker Natura & Co, and former central bank presidents Gustavo Loyola and Arminio Fraga.
In a broadside against the government, they called for more urgency in sourcing vaccines, free masks for the needy, better federal coordination on the pandemic and consideration of a national or regional lockdown strategy. 

The message from such prominent economists and bankers cut at Bolsonaro's core political argument that he has defended jobs by opposing lockdowns, which the letter called a ""false choice between saving lives and ensuring support for the vulnerable.""
""It's not reasonable to expect an economic recovery in an out-of-control epidemic,"" they wrote.

The college, in the capital Khartoum, is one of the few places in Sudan where students with impaired hearing can enrol in higher education. Though many do well at school, they are steered away from scientific or technical further studies, which are considered harder to teach them. 
In practical classes, diminished hearing reduces distractions and allows the students to focus, teachers at the arts college say. They use their own vocabulary to describe colours, for example, but they struggle with theory and general subjects, where more information is given orally.
""We face a lot of problems,"" said Aboulqassim Othman, a deaf graphic design student, using sign language to communicate through an interpreter. ""While the teacher is talking, the student won't hear.""
The arts college took its first hearing impaired student in 2003. Now it has about 50 doing undergraduate degrees, and some 200 studying for diplomas.
But during a long economic crisis in Sudan, interpreters have left for better paid work in the Gulf.
""It is unfair for students with special needs to be included in a programme that is not prepared to include them,"" said Awad Eissa, a teacher. 
One of the remaining interpreters, Abdallah Ahmed, said he worked long hours to earn a salary that barely covers food and transport.
Hard of hearing students sometimes end up translating for friends who are completely deaf.
As with most young people in Sudan, opportunities after graduation are limited, even after a 2019 uprising which often called for increased rights for those with disabilities. 
But many of the students maintain a passion for the arts. 

""I am interested in photography to cover political events like the revolution,"" said Adam Hammad, who wears a hearing aid.

EU's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton had said the EU did not need the Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19 and could achieve immunity across the continent using European production.
""It's a strange statement. We're not imposing anything on anyone,"" Putin said at a televised meeting about Russian vaccines. 
""This raises a question: Whose interests are these people defending and representing? The interests of some pharmaceutical companies or those of the citizens of European countries?""
The European Medicines Agency (EMA), whose representatives are set to visit Russia next month, launched a rolling review of Sputnik V earlier this month.
But some European officials have called into question the need for the Russian vaccine.
An EMA official urged EU members this month to refrain from approving Sputnik V at a national level while the agency was still reviewing it. 
Putin also held a phone call with European Council President Charles Michel to discuss the possible use of Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19, the Kremlin said on Monday. 
Earlier this month, Michel had cast doubt on Russia's motives for promoting Sputnik V abroad, saying Moscow had organised limited but widely publicised operations to supply the vaccine to other countries. 

Putin told Michel that Russia was ready to resume cooperation with the trade bloc but that ties were currently unsatisfactory due to the EU's confrontational and unconstructive policies at times, the Kremlin said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The trial of Canadian Michael Kovrig, who has been held in China for more than two years on espionage charges, wrapped up in a closed Beijing courtroom on Monday with the verdict to be announced at an unspecified later date, according to state media. 
China arrested Kovrig, a former diplomat, and fellow Canadian Michael Spavor in December 2018, soon after Canadian police detained Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese tech company Huawei Technologies, on a U.S. warrant.
Beijing insists the detentions are not linked to the detention of Meng, who remains under house arrest in Vancouver as she fights extradition to the United States. Beijing has repeatedly called on Ottawa to release her. 
The Kovrig trial came just days after the United States raised concerns over the cases at tense talks with China in Alaska. On Monday, Canadian and other diplomats were denied access to the hearing. 
William Klein, charge d'affaires of the U.S. embassy in China, told reporters outside the courthouse as he stood beside his Canadian counterpart that the United States would treat the cases of the two men ""as if they were American citizens.""
Canadian Foreign Minister Marc Garneau said ""the eyes of the world are on these cases"" and thanked international partners for their support. 
In a show of solidarity, 28 diplomats from 26 countries, including the United States, Britain, Germany, Australia, Netherlands and Czech Republic, turned up outside the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate Court on Monday, where there was a heavy police presence. 
""We are deeply troubled by the total lack of transparency surrounding these hearings and we continue to work towards an immediate end to their arbitrary detention,"" Garneau said in a statement.
China's state media outlet CCTV reported that Kovrig and his lawyer were in court and that the verdict, like the one for Spavor, who was tried on Friday, would be announced at a later date.
""We've requested access to Michael Kovrig's hearing repeatedly but that access is being denied"" for national security reasons, Jim Nickel, charge d'affaires of the Canadian embassy in China, told reporters outside the Beijing court. ""Now we see that the court process itself is not transparent. We're very troubled by this."" 
Nickel said Canada would protest the lack of access to China's foreign ministry.
'SOLIDARITY'
""We are here to show solidarity. Arbitrary detention is not the way,"" a diplomat told Reuters, declining to be named as she was not authorized to speak on the record about the trial.
The Canadian side had assembled a group of diplomats to ""point fingers"" and was ""wantonly interfering in China's judicial sovereignty"", said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying. 
More than 50 countries signed a declaration in February to condemn the arbitrary detention of foreign citizens for political purposes.
Some diplomats took off their face masks as they posed for a group photo outside the court, with each shouting out which country they represented to help reporters identify them.
On Friday, Spavor, a businessman, also stood trial in a closed courtroom in the northeastern city of Dandong.
Canadian and other diplomats were not allowed to attend Spavor's trial on what China said were national security grounds, a lack of transparency that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday called ""completely unacceptable"".
Observers have said the likely convictions of the two men could ultimately facilitate a diplomatic agreement in which they are released and sent back to Canada.
Chinese courts have a conviction rate of over 99%.
""Michael and Michael Spavor are innocent Canadians caught up in a bigger geopolitical dispute,"" Kovrig's wife, Vina Nadjibulla, told Reuters.
""Their detention is profoundly unjust and our focus must remain on securing their freedom."" 

Spavor's trial took place as the United States and China held rancorous high-level talks in Alaska. The United States raised the issue during the talks, a senior Biden administration official said, including its concerns that diplomats were barred from the courtroom in Spavor's trial.

Martin told Ireland's RTE radio that representatives of vaccine-maker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc had expressed concern to him that EU export restrictions on vaccines might affect its supply of raw materials for vaccine production. 
""I am very much against it. I think it would be a very retrograde step,"" Martin said when asked if he supported proposed export limits on COVID-19 vaccines produced in the European Union. 
""If every country and every continent started doing that, we would be in right trouble globally and we would set it (global vaccine production) back,"" Martin said.

""Every company are saying this to us. They are very very worried,"" Martin said. 
He said Moderna and Johnson & Johnson had indicated they hoped to increase production, but that the plans would be dependent on the availability of ingredients.

If the report says Sturgeon knowingly broke the code of conduct, she would be expected to resign, which could have seismic consequences for Scottish politics and the future of the United Kingdom.
Scottish elections are due in May, and Sturgeon has vowed to press for an independence referendum if her Scottish National Party (SNP) wins an absolute majority. If she is forced out and the SNP falls short of a majority, the momentum for a referendum could be lost.
The report by independent adviser James Hamilton, a senior lawyer, examines how Sturgeon and her administration handled allegations of sexual harassment against her predecessor Alex Salmond.
Salmond was once Sturgeon's close friend and political ally, with the pair forming a powerful partnership campaigning for the cause of Scottish independence. But they have turned on each other and their feud is jeopardising their shared dream.
Salmond accuses Sturgeon of being part of a conspiracy to drive him from public life, a claim she has rejected as absurd.
The Scottish government said it had received Hamilton's report and was completing legally required checks before publishing it.
""James Hamilton has submitted a note with his report in which he states that he understands that it will be necessary for the Scottish Government to make redactions before publication, to comply with court orders and avoid jigsaw identification,"" the government said. 
It was referring to the identities of the women who complained about Salmond.

Scots voted against independence from the United Kingdom by 55%-45% in 2014. On Monday, the Scottish government published a draft independence referendum bill which Sturgeon's Scottish National Party said it would seek to pass in the first half of the next parliament should it win May's election.

Russian authorities in the autonomous region deny what human rights groups, media and filmmakers have described as a purge, with dozens of LGBT+ people rounded-up and tortured since 2017.
The EU blacklisted Aiub Vakhaevich Kataev, a senior official at the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry in Chechnya, and Abuzaid Dzhandarovich Vismuradov, deputy prime minister of the Chechnya region and the commander of a special security unit that the EU said was responsible for persecution.
Vismuradov is already under U.S. sanctions.
""The repressions are directed against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, those presumed to belong to LGBTI groups,"" the EU said in its Official Journal, where it published the asset freezes and travel bans. 
The EU said gay and lesbian individuals were wrongly accused of being opponents of Ramzan Kadyrov, who is the leader of Russia's Muslim-majority Chechnya region and a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Kadyrov is also under U.S. sanctions for rights abuses, which he denies. His spokesman has said there could be no attacks on gay men because there were no such people in Chechnya.

In the city of Mawlamyine, rows of stuffed toys carrying placards with anti-junta signs were carefully arranged across the width of a small street, resembling a rally. 
Elsewhere, helium-filled balloons were released on Monday bearing messages calling for international help. Street protesters were replaced by toy cars or dolls, some led by cardboard cutouts or manikins dressed in outfits.
A group of women even swapped crowds for cookware, with each pot, pan or bowl carrying messages like ""pray for Myanmar's democracy"" and ""free our leaders"".
These are just some of the small acts of defiance by people in Myanmar to avoid becoming the next victims of an unrelenting crackdown by security forces that has seen deaths and arrests of demonstrators on a daily basis. 
At least 250 protesters have been killed since the military's Feb. 1 coup, according to activists, who accuse the junta of using death as a deterrent and being impervious to international criticism. 
Hundreds of red balloons were released on Monday near the biggest city Yangon, calling for outside intervention, each attached to signs that said ""R2P"", or Responsibility to Protect, the global commitment of United Nations members to prevent atrocities.
Other signs tied to the balloons had U.N. logos and the message ""How many dead bodies are needed to take action?""
To avoid potentially fatal street confrontations, drivers crawled along Yangon roads on Monday in convoys of cars honking horns while performing three-finger salutes from their windows. 
Medical workers in Mandalay marched at dawn in white coats, beating the patrols by security forces that have seen chaos in the streets. 
""They protest in all ways that they can. Everyday people come up with creative ways in order to protest,"" one social media user told Reuters, requesting anonymity due to fears about his safety. 
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered cross-legged on the ground in Hakha in Chin state on Sunday night at a candle-lit vigils, where they chanted messages denouncing dictatorship. 
About 150 km (90 miles) away in the town of Mindat, scores of anti-coup posters were planted in a square in front of the town's market, each saying ""the military dictatorship must fail"".

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider the U.S. Justice Department's bid to reinstate Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's death sentence for helping carry out the 2013 attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others.
The department's appeal, filed before former President Donald Trump left office in January, challenged a lower court's decision ordering a new trial over the sentence Tsarnaev should receive for the death penalty-eligible crimes for which he was convicted.
President Joe Biden's administration has given no indication it plans to reverse the Trump administration's approach to the case, as it has done in several other cases pending at the court.
The 27-year-old Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, precipitated five days of panic in Boston when they detonated two homemade pressure cooker bombs at the marathon's finish line on April 15, 2013, and then tried to flee the city. In the days that followed, they also killed a police officer. Tsarnaev's brother died after a gunfight with police.
Jurors in 2015 found Tsarnaev guilty of all 30 counts he faced and later determined he deserved execution for a bomb he planted that killed Martin Richard, 8, and Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, 23. Restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, was also killed.
The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge ""fell short"" in screening jurors for potential bias following pervasive news coverage of the bombings.
The Justice Department appealed that ruling, which ordered a new trial over the sentence to be given for the death penalty-eligible charges. The department argued that the appeals court adopted a standard that wrongly denied trial judges the ""broad discretion"" to manage juries provided for by Supreme Court precedents.
Prosecutors said that if the ruling stands, it would have to retry the death penalty phase of the case and ""victims will have to once again take the stand to describe the horrors that respondent inflicted on them.""

The justices will hear oral arguments and issue a ruling in the court's next term, which starts in October and ends in June 2022.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - A senior Mumbai police officer filed a complaint in the Supreme Court on Monday accusing a state government minister of corruption, the latest development in a bizarre case that has transfixed the media for weeks.
""Each sordid revelation... has chipped away at public confidence in the functioning of a vital arm of government in the country's financial capital,"" said an editorial in the Indian Express, one of the country's leading English-language newspapers.
Param Bir Singh, the former head of police in Mumbai, filed a petition seeking an ""unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair investigation"" into corruption allegations against Anil Deshmukh, interior minister of Maharashtra state that is home to the city. 
Deshmukh has denied impropriety. 
With claims of graft, a suspicious death and a bomb threat against India's richest man, the case has the hallmarks of a thriller made by the country's Bollywood film industry, dominating TV networks and newspaper front pages and trending on social media for almost a month.
On Feb. 25, a car laden with explosives was found near the Mumbai home of Mukesh Ambani, who heads Reliance Industries and is India's richest man. 
The purported owner of the vehicle was later found dead, with police treating his death as suspicious.
Sachin Vaze, a senior Mumbai police officer, was arrested on March 13 by India's federal National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the bomb threat. He denies wrongdoing. 
In a statement, Reliance said it was confident police in Mumbai ""will complete their thorough investigation quickly"".
Last week, Singh was transferred from his role as Mumbai's police commissioner for his handling of the case.
In Monday's petition, Singh said his transfer was illegal, and that Deshmukh interfered in police investigations and worked with Vaze and other officers to extort money from local businesses. 
Deshmukh denied the allegations, saying that purported meetings with Vaze last month were impossible as he was in hospital with COVID-19 and then in quarantine.
The case is an additional headache for the opposition-led government in Maharashtra that is already battling a surge in COVID-19 cases. 
India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has repeatedly called for the resignation of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who turned against the BJP after a power-sharing agreement collapsed. 

He is due to address a news briefing later in the day.

At least 250 people have been killed so far in anti-junta protests which the security forces are trying to stamp out, according to figures from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group.
""The number of murders has reached an unbearable extent, which is why we will not be able to avoid imposing sanctions,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters as he arrived in Brussels for a meeting with his EU counterparts.
The names of 11 people involved in the coup and repression of demonstrators will be made public after the meeting, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said.
They would be the bloc's most significant response to the coup so far.
According to diplomats and two internal documents seen by Reuters last week, the EU is also planning to target companies ""generating revenue for, or providing financial support to, the Myanmar Armed Forces"".
""We don't intend to punish the people of Myanmar but those who blatantly violate human rights,"" Maas said. 
A spokesman for the junta did not respond to calls seeking comment. He has previously said security forces have used force only when necessary.
The Southeast Asian nation has been locked in crisis since the elected government led by Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi was overthrown by the military on Feb 1. 
The violence has forced many citizens to think up novel ways to express their rejection of a return to army rule.
CAR HORNS, SHOTS
In downtown areas of the commercial capital Yangon, motorists honked car horns in response to a call on social media to mark the one-month anniversary of the launch of one of the biggest demonstrations since the coup.
In the western town of Mindat in Chin state, protesters planted scores of posters in a square in front of the main market saying ""Military dictatorship must fail"".
In the latest violence, one person was killed in the country's second city of Mandalay, aid workers and news reports said.
Four people were killed and several wounded in the city on Sunday when security forces opened fire after residents tried to resist efforts by the military to set up a base in a school, the Myanmar Now news portal reported.
One man was shot dead and several were wounded when police opened fire on a group setting up a barricade in the central town of Monywa, a doctor there said on Sunday as a community group issued a call on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for blood donors.
""Sniper, sniper,"" people can be heard shouting in a video clip shortly after the man was shot in the head in Monywa and more shots rang out.
State media said on Sunday that men on motorcycles attacked a member of the security forces who later died. The military said two policemen were killed in earlier protests.
SOUTHEAST ASIAN DIPLOMATIC PUSH
The junta says a Nov. 8 election won by Suu Kyi's party was fraudulent, an accusation rejected by the electoral commission. Military leaders have promised a new election but have not set a date.
Asian neighbours, who have for years avoided criticising each other, have begun speaking out.
Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan will visit Brunei Darussalam on Monday before going to Malaysia and Indonesia, which are seeking an urgent meeting of Southeast Asia's ASEAN regional grouping, of which Myanmar is a member.
Heng Swee Keat, deputy prime minister of Singapore, said his country was ""appalled by the violent crackdowns against civilians"" and called for a return to the democratic transition.
The island-state, which has deep economic ties with Myanmar, has previously called the military action a ""national shame"". 
The BBC said on Monday that one of its reporters in Myanmar who was detained by plainclothes men three days ago had been freed. Aung Thura, from the BBC's Burmese service, was detained on Friday along with a journalist who works for the domestic Mizzima news service.
There was no immediate word on the whereabouts of the Mizzima reporter.
Australian media reported that two Australian business consultants were detained as they tried to leave Myanmar, but it was not clear why. An Australian foreign ministry spokesperson said it was providing consular assistance but declined to comment further for privacy reasons.
Sean Turnell, an Australian economic adviser to deposed leader Suu Kyi, was detained last month. The army has not announced any charges against Turnell, who is among nearly 2,000 people the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners says have been detained since the coup.

""Every day I imagine the moment my phone rings and you are at the other end of the line, telling me you are your way home,"" Turnell's wife Ha Vu wrote on her Facebook page on Monday. ""I pray for that day to be soon. In the meantime, I irrevocably believe that you are still treated well, with dignity and respect.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Eight Hong Kong democracy activists, jailed in China last year after being captured at sea, arrived back in the city and were immediately detained on Monday in a case that has drawn international attention and concern over their treatment. 
They were among 12 activists facing charges in Hong Kong over pro-democracy protests, who were intercepted by mainland authorities in August 2020 on a boat allegedly en route to Taiwan.
They were sent home to Hong Kong on Monday after serving a sentence in China for illegally crossing the border, only to be detained on arrival on the previous Hong Kong charges.
Activist and barrister Chow Hang-tung, speaking on behalf of a concern group for the defendants, said she was unhappy with the handover arrangements for them.
""(Authorities) never communicated with the family about the whole arrangement so the family members are forced to come here and wait all day until now,"" Chow said at a press briefing outside a Hong Kong police station close to the mainland border.
""Just for the very thin hope of seeing their families, waving to them, shouting to them, even till now, they still haven’t had any chance to meet their sons.""
Johnny Patterson, policy director for rights group Hong Kong Watch, said the ""appalling ordeal"" the group faced ""shines a spotlight on the draconian new normal in Hong Kong."" 
""It's a case of out of the frying pan, into the fire."" 
Among the eight is Andy Li, arrested under a sweeping national security law Beijing imposed on the Asian financial hub in June 2020 that critics say is aimed at crushing dissent.
In December, a Chinese court sentenced 10 of the 12 to between seven months and three years in jail. Defendants Tang Kai-yin and Quinn Moon, who were sentenced to three and two years, respectively, are still in southern Guangdong province. 
Two minors who were among the 12 pleaded guilty to illegally crossing the border and were returned to Hong Kong in December. 
During the detention of the 12 in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, mainland authorities denied their families and lawyers access, insisting they be represented by officially appointed lawyers, provoking criticism from rights groups. 
Pro-democracy activists began fleeing Hong Kong for Taiwan from the early months of the protests in 2019, most legally by air, but some by boat, activists in Taipei have told Reuters.
Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of freedoms not seen on the mainland, including freedom of speech and assembly. Democracy activists complain that Communist Party rulers in Beijing are whittling away at those freedoms, a charge China rejects.

Since Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong, scores of democracy campaigners have been arrested, some elected legislators have been disqualified and others have fled overseas.

152,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 08:16AM ET</span>",Egyptian feminist and author el-Saadawi dies at 89,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian feminist and writer Nawal el-Saadawi, a leading voice on women's rights in the Arab world who was detained for her views and had some of her works banned, has died aged 89.
Saadawi died in hospital in Cairo on Sunday and was buried at a funeral attended by relatives, her agent said. 
Saadawi was born on Oct. 27, 1931, and graduated from Cairo University's faculty of medicine.
In her autobiography ""A Daughter of Isis"", she described growing up in a patriarchal culture where girls were subjected to abuses including child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM). 
After being subjected to the procedure herself as a young girl, she became an early campaigner against FGM while working as a doctor in the 1950s and 1960s.
Later, she railed against religious authorities, Islamists and governments for their defence of conservative values and wrote dozens of books that addressed taboos including sexuality and prostitution. 
'ALL IN SAME BOAT'
""After travelling all over the world ... I discovered that girls are brought up in a very similar way – we are all in the same boat. The patriarchal, religious, capitalist system is universal,"" Saadawi told the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation in 2018. 
Saadawi's views repeatedly landed her in trouble with the authorities in Egypt.
She was dismissed from the health ministry in the 1970s and jailed in 1981 after criticising President Anwar Sadat, shortly before his assassination. In the 1990s she spent a spell in exile after death threats from Islamist militants. 
Many of her books, which include ""Women and Sex"" and ""The Hidden Face of Eve"", were translated abroad. 
But in Egypt, where she was often depicted as a troublemaker advocating Western views, some of her works were denounced and pulled from circulation. 

Saadawi married and divorced three times and is survived by two children, writer Mona Helmy and film director Atef Hatata.

The attackers raided three villages in the Tahoua region, which borders Mali. A security source blamed Islamic State, whose local affiliate is active in the zone.
Alfouzazi Issintag, mayor of Tillia, the rural commune to which the villages belong, told Reuters there were about 60 deaths but that he did not yet have a final toll. 
A village leader in the region who requested anonymity put the number of people killed at around 70. 
The violence is part of a wider security crisis across West Africa's Sahel region, which is also fuelled by militants linked to al Qaeda, the Islamic State and ethnic militias. 
The attacks on Sunday might have been revenge for the recent arrests of people suspected of belonging to armed groups in the area, said a report by the cluster of humanitarian organizations led by the U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR). 
Unidentified assailants killed at least 58 villagers in the nearby region of Tillabery last Monday.

""The accused should tell the court what happened since the deceased was arrested in good health,"" High Court Judge Erick Ogolla ruled. 
The policemen - Naftali Chege, Charles Wangombe Munyiri, Baraka Bulima and John Pamba - were accused of killing 28-year-old Monson, son of Nicholas, the 12th Baron Monson, and heir to a family estate in Lincolnshire, in eastern England. 
Monson was found dead in his cell after being arrested for smoking cannabis. 
The police have said Monson died of an overdose, but his mother Hilary Monson told the court that her son had not been a drug addict at the time of his death.
Two reports by government pathologists, seen by Reuters at the time, said that Monson had died after suffering a traumatic blow to the head. An inquest found there had been attempts to cover up the incident, and threats against witnesses. 
The ruling is the result of an inquest that began in 2019 in the coastal city of Mombasa in a case seen as a test of whether Kenya’s security services can be held accountable for the use of excessive force and extrajudicial killings.
The judge said he was satisfied with the case presented by the prosecution, which sought to have the four face murder charges over Monson's death.
The judge said no evidence was presented in court to show Monson was assaulted elsewhere other than within the police station after he was detained. 
Forty-five witnesses including police officers testified during the inquest.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed victory over COVID-19 by making Israel a ""vaccination nation"". Even that may not be enough when voters wearing mandatory masks cast their ballots in an election on Tuesday.
Netanyahu, who turned Israel's world-leading rollout of vaccines into a showcase of his campaign in the country's fourth national poll in two years, gave a measured assessment of his chances after the latest opinion polls pointed to a close race.
""I'm still missing a (parliamentary) seat or two to achieve a stable government,"" he said on Army Radio on Sunday, in what could have been a strategic bid to rally supporters of his right-wing Likud party to turn out to vote.
Opinion polls showed an uptick for Likud in the campaign's home stretch, giving a Netanyahu-led coalition of conservative and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties around 60 seats, still short of a majority in the 120-member parliament.
But the surveys indicated that a potential, though perhaps unlikely alliance of left-wing, centre and rightist factions, possibly led by Netanyahu's strongest rival in the polls - centrist Yair Lapid of the Yesh Atid party - is also near 60.
No one party has ever won a parliamentary majority on its own in an Israeli election. In a close contest, election night results may only be a starting point, with backroom coalition talks determining whether ""King Bibi"" will still rule.
Gone this time were Netanyahu's giant billboards featuring a handshake with ally Donald Trump, defeated in the U.S. presidential election in November.
And with Democrat Joe Biden in the White House, there was little prospect of U.S. diplomatic moves that could help Netanyahu's election chances.
Israel's longest-serving leader, 71, focused instead on highlighting his role in turning high-tech Israel into what he dubbed a ""vaccination nation"".
About half of the population has been inoculated at a pace that drew international praise for Netanyahu but also calls for Israel to do more to ensure Palestinians in territories it occupies receive vaccines.
""We are the world champions in handling the coronavirus ... I have brought millions of vaccine doses and will bring millions more,"" Netanyahu said on the stump, pacing the stage in multiple campaign rallies each day and in a slew of media interviews as election day neared.
Political opponents say he mishandled the pandemic from the start, pointing to the need for three national lockdowns and accusing him of turning a blind eye to violators within the ultra-Orthodox community that provides a power base for his key coalition partners.
'OBSESSION'
For Netanyahu, public praise from Albert Bourla, CEO of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Israel's main vaccine supplier, was campaign gold. The prime minister, Bourla told Israel's Channel 12 TV, phoned him 30 times to secure a supply deal - even at 3 a.m.
""Just like I was obsessive about the vaccines, I'll be obsessive about our economy,"" Netanyahu said on Army Radio, promising more cash stipends for all Israelis and ailing businesses.
But after three inconclusive elections, voters have had plenty of time to make up their minds about Netanyahu, in a ballot being held almost a quarter of a century to the day after he won his first term as prime minister.
Despite corruption charges he denies, weekly street protests over his alleged graft, a trial scheduled to gain speed after the ballot and elections in April and September 2019 and last March, Netanyahu has managed to stay at Israel's helm.
This time, much could depend on potential kingmaker Naftali Bennett, who heads the ultranationalist Yamina party and once served as Netanyahu's defence minister.
Without Bennett's backing, neither a Netanyahu-led coalition nor an anti-Bibi alliance would have enough seats in parliament for a governing majority, polls showed.
And Arab voters might also tip the balance, six years after Netanyahu, drawing allegations of racism, said on election day that they were ""heading to the polling stations in droves"" to wreck his chances for a right-wing government.

Now, he peers down from Arabic-language Likud billboards and has campaigned in several Arab towns. Looking at their country's messy political mix, many Israelis simply wonder whether a fifth election is on the cards.

Authorities said the Philippines coast guard had reported that about 220 vessels, believed to be manned by Chinese maritime militia personnel, were seen moored at the Whitsun Reef, which Manila calls the Julian Felipe Reef, on March 7.
""We call on the Chinese to stop this incursion and immediately recall these boats violating our maritime rights and encroaching into our sovereign territory,"" Defence Minister Delfin Lorenzana said.
The Philippine military had conducted air and maritime patrols in the South China Sea to further validate the report, spokesman Marine Major General Edgard Arevalo said, but did not say when.
The military had submitted its findings to other government agencies, and they would be used as basis for taking ""appropriate actions not limited to filing diplomatic protests"", he said in a statement, without elaborating.
""The (Armed Forces of the Philippines) will not renege from our commitment to protect and defend our maritime interest within the bounds of the law,"" Arevalo said.
Chinese boats have fished near the reef for a long time, and recently, some have been sheltering in the area due to sea conditions, said China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying on Monday. 
""I think this is very normal, and hope all sides can view this rationally,"" she said at a daily news conference. 
Foreign minister Teodoro Locsin, asked whether he would file a diplomatic protest over the boats, told a journalist on Twitter: ""Only if the generals tell me. In my watch, foreign policy is the fist in the iron glove of the armed forces.""
The vessels are fishing boats believed to be manned by Chinese military-trained personnel, according to Philippines security officials. 
The vessels' presence in the area raises concern about overfishing and the destruction of the marine environment, as well as risks to safe navigation, a Philippine cross-government task force said late on Saturday.
An international tribunal invalidated China's claim to 90% of the South China Sea in 2016, but Beijing does not recognise the ruling. China has built islands in the disputed waters in recent years, putting air strips on some of them.
Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei all claim parts of the sea.
In January, the Philippines protested at a new Chinese law allowing its coast guard to fire on foreign vessels, describing it as a ""threat of war"".
The United States has repeatedly denounced what it called China's attempts to bully neighbours with competing interests, while Beijing has criticised Washington for what it calls interference in its internal affairs.
The Whitsun Reef is within Manila's exclusive economic zone, the task force said, describing the site as ""a large boomerang-shaped shallow coral reef at the northeast of Pagkakaisa Banks and Reefs"".

The task force vowed to continue ""to peacefully and proactively pursue its initiatives on environmental protection, food security and freedom of navigation"" in the South China Sea.

PITT TOWN, Australia (Reuters) - Australia was set on Monday to evacuate thousands more people from suburbs in Sydney's west, battered by the worst flooding in 60 years, with torrential rains expected to continue for another day or two.
Reuters images showed submerged intersections, marooned livestock and cars up to their windshields in water, out of which poked the tops of street signs, as three days of rain swelled rivers in the most populous state of New South Wales (NSW).
""This is an ongoing situation that is evolving and is extremely dangerous,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told parliament.
Two major insurers said most of the more than 3,300 claims they received concerned damage to property, with more expected. Suncorp and IAG (LON:ICAG) said it was too early to estimate the final number of claims or costs.
Australia's coal exports were disrupted, as the deluge shut rail lines into the port of Newcastle, the world's largest coal export port, and forced some mines to cut output.
The rain submerging large swathes of the state contrasts with weather conditions a year ago, when authorities were battling drought and catastrophic bushfires. 
""I don't know any time in state history where we have had these extreme weather conditions in such quick succession in the middle of a pandemic,"" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters.
Sunday was Sydney's wettest day of the year, with almost 111 mm (4.4 inches) of rain, while nearly 900 mm (35 inches) was dumped in some north coast regions in the last six days, or more than three times the March average, government data showed. 
The Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers flooded most of northwestern Sydney, leaving residents stranded.
""You get a lot of rubbish. It was going past...as fast as the ski boats go...As soon as it broke the banks, it was like a torrent,"" said Larry Powers, after he was rescued by emergency services following a day's wait at his property in Pitt Town.
A helicopter rescued a stranded bride and groom on Saturday to get them to the church on time. The bride, Kate Fotheringham, posted a picture of the newly weds kissing in front of a flooded bridge that had blocked their five-minute drive into town.
""I made it to the church and married the love of my life!"" she said on Twitter on Monday.
Authorities said about 18,000 people have been evacuated from low-lying areas.
Large parts of the east coast will get more heavy rain from Monday, brought by a combination of a tropical low over the northern part of Western Australia and a coastal trough off New South Wales, said Jane Golding, a weather official.
""We expect this heavy rain to fall on areas that haven't seen as much rain over the last few days,"" Golding told reporters. ""We expect the flood risk to develop in those areas as well.""
Some parts of Sydney's western regions have suffered the worst flooding since 1961, said authorities, who expect the wild weather to last until Wednesday.

A severe flood warning has been issued for large parts of New South Wales, as well as neighbouring Queensland.

Putin said last week that he and Biden should hold such talks in the coming days after diplomatic ties sank to a new post-Cold War low following Biden's comments in an ABC interview.
""We note with regret that the American side has not supported (Putin's) proposal to hold talks with U.S President Biden...to discuss problems that have built up in bilateral relations and also the theme around strategic (nuclear) stability,"" Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement.

The eight women say they have few career options and hope animation will also become a source of income as well as an advocacy tool.
They have already made two short films - one about sign language and another advocating their right to work in Gaza, where unemployment stands at 49 percent. The stories, they say, are meant to inspire hearing-impaired people to pursue their own goals despite any obstacles in their way. 
The animation process is simple: the women design characters, draw the images on paper, shoot the film with their cellphone cameras using a stop motion application, and coworkers without hearing loss add the voices.
Hiba Abu Jazar, 27, who has enjoyed cartoons since she was a girl, said she was excited to make her own films and to teach others to do the same. She hopes the skill will help her find employment. 
""I want to be self-dependent and make films so I can make an income. People with hearing disabilities have no jobs and no chances of finding jobs,"" Abu Jazar said in sign language through a translator at Gaza Hemam Youth Center where the training takes place.

The group's trainer, Haneen Koraz, said the project offered the woman a way to promote their cause and pursue their ambitions through art and creativity.

(Reuters) - Jury selection was due to continue on Monday in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged in the death of George Floyd last year in a violent arrest that spurred nationwide protests against racism.
Twelve jurors and one alternate have been seated since the trial began two weeks ago: five white women, two white men, three Black men, one Black woman and two multiracial women, according to court records. 
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill said he wants to find two more alternates before opening arguments, which are scheduled to begin on March 29.
A bystander's video showed Chauvin, who is white, with his knee on Floyd's neck as Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, begged for his life during the arrest on May 25, 2020. 
Cahill and the lawyers in the case have questioned more than 60 potential jurors in court to weigh their impartiality as Chauvin, dressed in a suit and tie, took extensive notes on a yellow legal pad.
Potential jurors all completed an unusually detailed 16-page questionnaire last year asking them their knowledge of the arrest and their opinions of Chauvin, policing, the media and the Black Lives Matter movement for racial justice.
All of them have said they were aware of video. Almost all said they had seen at least some of the footage, which sparked global protests against police brutality and racism. 

Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted on the most serious charge.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions may not deter Russia from its alleged election meddling and cyber hacking in the short term but will signal Washington's renewed willingness to hold the Kremlin publicly to account for acts it views as malign.
President Joe Biden has vowed Russian President Vladimir Putin will ""pay a price"" and is expected to impose sanctions as soon as this week that could range from freezing the U.S. assets of Russians to curbing Moscow's ability to issue sovereign debt.
Russia denies meddling in U.S. elections and orchestrating the cyber hack that used U.S. tech company SolarWinds Corp to penetrate U.S. government networks.
The Kremlin has also dismissed reports it offered bounties to Taliban militants to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
While the two nations' presidents quickly extended the New START arms control treaty, Biden has taken a much tougher stance toward Putin than his predecessor, Donald Trump, and the U.S. and Russian leaders have made no secret of their disagreements.
In an interview last week the new Democratic president agreed with an interviewer who asked if he thought the Russian leader was a ""killer,"" prompting Putin to respond with a Russian playground chant that ""he who said it, did it.""
Analysts said sanctions were unlikely to deter Russia and it was necessary to harden U.S. society to resist disinformation campaigns like the one Putin likely directed to try to sway the 2020 U.S. election in favor of Trump, a Republican, according to a U.S. intelligence assessment released on Tuesday. 
The assessment showed Russia did little to hide its hand in trying to influence the election, suggesting such efforts may now simply be a fact of life, said Andrew Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank.
""That's a long-term problem for Western societies and we shouldn't expect the administration is just magically going to solve it,"" he said, adding Washington wanted ""to send a message: we're watching these activities, we're going to call them out.""
A former U.S. official said that even though sanctions may not change Moscow's behavior in the short term, there can be a benefit to drawing clear lines about what is not acceptable.
""What they are trying to do with their Russia policy is to discourage risk-taking by the Russians, to carve out small areas where there are abilities to cooperate and to be very clear in specific and timely reactions that there will always be a cost to Russian behavior,"" said the former U.S. official.
""That wasn't the case under the Trump administration,"" the former official said on condition of anonymity.
MANY SANCTIONS IN U.S. ARSENAL
Among the punitive tools in Biden's arsenal are:
- Executive Order 13848, under which the U.S. government can freeze the U.S. assets of any foreign individual or entity found to have directly or indirectly interfered in a U.S. election;
- Executive Orders 13757 and 13694, which enables Washington to freeze the U.S. assets of those engaging in ""cyber-enabled"" activities from abroad that threaten U.S. national security, foreign policy, economic health or financial stability;
- Executive Order 13818, which implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and lets Washington freeze the U.S. assets and bar the U.S. entry of foreigners who commit human rights violations or engage in corruption;
-- the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, which, among other things, authorizes the president to bar U.S. banks from lending to a country that used chemical weapons.
Under pressure from Congress after the British government accused Russia of using the Novichok nerve agent to try to kill former spy Sergei Skripal, Trump in 2019 prohibited U.S. banks from participating in the primary market for Russia's non-rouble sovereign debt. 
Biden could go further by applying such restrictions to rouble-denominated debt or by extending them to the secondary market, though this would be a big step. 
The Kremlin has accused British intelligence agencies of staging the Skripal attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a congressional aide played down the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions in general and said Russian sovereign debt restrictions were not likely to have much effect ""on Putin's calculations on the use of poison.""
However, Dan Fried, a former top U.S. diplomat for Europe, described Putin as ""a rational actor within his own frame of reference (who) calculates risks and benefits.""

""If he sees that there will be a strong and organized response from the West, that will enter into his calculations,"" Fried said. ""We know from Soviet history that sustained pressure over time, combined with internal stagnation ... both political and economic can lead to a strategic reassessment by Russia's leaders.""

Many schools continue to teach students remotely more than a year after the novel coronavirus prompted widespread closures across the United States, and the Biden administration has been aiming to reopen in-person learning for millions of public school students without sparking coronavirus outbreaks.
Education officials at the Los Angeles Unified School (LAUSD) district are tentatively planning for physical classes to restart at elementary and preschools by mid-April, while grades 7-12 are scheduled to return by about the end of April.
""While the improving COVID-19 situation is still fragile, we believe this agreement puts LAUSD on the path to a physical reopening of schools that puts safety first,"" United Teachers Los Angeles union president Cecily Myart-Cruz said in a statement.
Under the agreement, elementary teachers will be expected to teach from their classrooms unless they have a verified medical reason to stay remote, while secondary teachers will teach most classes virtually.
The union said the district was also considering using outdoor tents for exceptionally large class sizes. 
On Friday, the U.S. government updated its COVID-19 guidelines, halving the acceptable distance between students who are wearing masks to at least three feet (0.91 m) from at least six feet.

The teachers' union said this change would not impact the agreement or its other safety measures - which include personal protective equipment, improved ventilation, daily cleaning and disinfection.

While Taiwan's air force is well trained and well equipped, mostly with U.S.-made equipment, it is dwarfed by China's. Beijing views the democratic island as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Chinese control.
Taiwan's National Rescue Command Centre said two air force F-5E fighters, each with one pilot aboard, crashed into the sea off the island's southeastern coast after they apparently collided in mid-air during a training mission.
An air force helicopter, coast guard and other rescue ships have been scrambled to look for the pilots, it added.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said it was working on a statement, and provided no other immediate comment. The official Central News Agency said the air force had now grounded the F-5 fleet that operates from the Chihhang air base, where the aircraft are based. 
The U.S.-built F-5 fighters first entered service in Taiwan in the late 1970s and have been mostly been retired from front-line activities, though some are still used for training and as a back-up for the main fleet.
Another F-5 crashed in October, killing the pilot. The following month a much more modern F-16 crashed off Taiwan's east coast, whose pilot also died.
In January of last year, Taiwan's top military official was among eight people killed after a helicopter carrying them to visit soldiers crashed in a mountainous area near the capital Taipei.
The incidents have raised concern about both training and maintenance, but also the pressure the air force is under to respond to repeated Chinese flights near the island.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry has warned Chinese aircraft, including drones, are flying repeatedly in Taiwan's air defence identification zone, seeking to wear out Taiwan's air force.

Foreign holidays are currently banned in the UK. Under the government's four-stage roadmap for easing pandemic restrictions, they could be allowed to resume from May 17 at the earliest, although it could be later than that.
""My advice would be to anybody right now is just to hold off on booking international travel,"" social care minister Helen Whately told the BBC on Monday. 
""It just feels premature to be booking international holidays at the moment.""
Europe's airlines and travel sector are now bracing for a second lost summer, with rebound hopes increasingly challenged by Europe's slow and chaotic COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
Shares in British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG), easyJet (LON:EZJ), TUI and Jet2 all traded down around 6-7% on Monday, paring some of the strong gains since Feb.22 when Britain announced its ambition to restart travel. 
While half of all adults in Britain have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, growing infection levels in France, Italy and Germany, fuelled by variants, means the UK may choose to restrict travel beyond the May 17 date. 
Whately's comments were the latest in a series of warnings from scientists, public health experts and politicians in recent days.
A second summer of restricted travel will place airlines and travel companies under renewed financial strain, after they've taken on huge debts to survive the last 12 months of lockdowns and holiday bans. 
Citi analyst Mark Manduca said he detected a ""heightened level of fatigue amongst fundamental investors"" whose recovery hopes had propelled a recent rebound in airline stocks.

""The upside momentum-driven express train of all things recovery is now beginning to peter out and falter,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's major tour bus firm Hato Bus Co. resumed its operations on Monday following the lifting of a coronavirus state of emergency for the Tokyo area, allowing passengers to enjoy fresh air and cherry blossoms in full bloom from an open top bus.
The Japanese government on Sunday lifted the state of emergency for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures, where restrictions had remained since early January, as the availability of hospital beds had improved in the region. 
""I have been working from home for a long time and had no chance to go out. So, (cherry blossoms) cheered me up very much,"" Masumi Ishii, a passenger, told Reuters after the tour.
On Hato Bus's open-top sightseeing bus that departed Tokyo station on Monday, all the 25 seats available on the upper deck were filled with passengers. 
They enjoyed taking pictures and reached out for cherry blossom petals along the roads.
""Frankly, I am very happy that we could resume this course,"" said Satomi Yoshizuka, a tour conductor. ""We are taking measures and preparations so that our customers can attend without anxiety.""
Passengers are required to put face masks on and undergo temperature checks. 
Although the government, eager to jumpstart the economy, lifted the state of emergency, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga last week noted infections were creeping up and pleaded with citizens not to let down their guard.
Pedestrians walking outside Tokyo station on Monday morning welcomed the end of the state of emergency and said its effect has been fading.
    Natsuki Kawakami, a 20-year-old university student visiting Tokyo from her home in Kyoto, said the prolonged state of emergency made people tired of self-restraint and less cautious. 
""I think it is good to make an end for now, and take another measure (in the future), which makes people brace themselves again,"" Kawakami said.

As of Sunday, COVID-19 cases have totalled about 457,000 in Japan, with 8,836 fatalities, according to public broadcaster NHK.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Jenny and Narumi wept for happiness last week when a Japanese court ruled that barring same-sex marriages was unconstitutional, a decision that allowed them to move a step closer to a legal marriage and starting a family. 
The ruling by the Sapporo district court, the first in Japan on the legality of same-sex marriages, was a major symbolic victory in Japan, the only country in the Group of Seven major nations to not fully recognise same-sex partnerships.
For Jenny and Narumi, who plan on a life together and have held a non-legally binding marriage ceremony, it was much more personal.
""I felt light, the light of hope,"" said Narumi, 27. Both she and Jenny declined to give their last names to Reuters due to Japan's still-conservative views on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) couples.
""It was a soft hope that perhaps soon, I don't know when, I might be able to marry Jenny in Japan.""
It was love at first sight for Jenny, 28, when she met Narumi in January 2020 via a dating app.
Their romance developed quickly, and by August they were living together and had taken out a partnership certificate, which helps with renting apartments and hospital visits but doesn't provide legal guarantees such as inheritance rights or custody of a partner's children. 
""We're really happy,"" said Jenny, who is half-American and half-Japanese. ""But if we could get legally married, for example, we could become parents."" 
""As it is, the child would be legally registered as having only one of us as its parent.""
The two have discussed moving to the United States if nothing changes in Japan, since Jenny is a U.S. citizen. 
Last week's ruling was on one of five similar ongoing cases in Japan. The ruling could set a precedent that influences other cases, but for same-sex marriage to be allowed, a new law needs to be put in place, which is likely to take some time.
Public thinking is changing, though. A weekend opinion poll by the Asahi Shimbun found 65% of respondents supported the ruling.
Both women said a big part of their joy was a sense the voices of LGBT Japanese residents had finally been heard in high places.
""I felt something long suppressed within myself come bursting out, that we'd finally been recognised,"" Narumi said.
Jenny said she realises being able to marry legally could take some time, but she is holding onto her dreams.
""If we could have the same legal guarantees as everyone else, I'd like to have children and live with Naru-chan,"" she said, using an affectionate nickname.

""I'd like to live in a house full of children, dogs and cats, a warm place full of laughter.""

Extradited by U.S. authorities this month, the U.S. Army Special Forces veteran and his son have been detained in the same prison in the Japanese capital where Ghosn was held.
In a statement, the Tokyo prosecutors' office said the men knowingly helped Ghosn evade punishment and escape to Lebanon by hiding him in carry-on luggage aboard a private jet that departed from western Japan's Kansai airport in Dec 2019.
The prosecutors did not say when they expect the trial to start. Japan's conviction rate is 99%.
Ghosn remains a fugitive in his childhood home, Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.
Japanese law does not allow suspects to have their lawyers present during questioning by prosecutors. Once charged, defendants are often refused bail by courts before trial.
Lawyers for the Taylors had waged a months-long battle to keep them from being sent to Japan, arguing they could not be prosecuted for helping someone to jump bail.
They also said they faced the prospect of relentless interrogation and torture.
The U.S. State Department rejected the torture claim as unlikely, and the U.S. Supreme Court last month cleared the way for their extradition. 
Prosecutors said Michael Taylor, a 60-year-old private security specialist, and his 28-year-old son received $1.3 million for their services.
At the time of his escape, Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges of financial wrongdoing charges, including understating his compensation in Nissan’s financial statements and enriching himself at his employer’s expense through payments to car dealerships.
Ghosn denies wrongdoing.
Greg Kelly, a former Nissan executive, is standing trial in Tokyo charged with helping Ghosn hide 9.3 billion yen ($85 million) in income.

The military alliance, which has been at war since 2015 against the Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls northern Yemen, said it struck a missile and drone assembly plant in Sanaa.
The United Nations said air strikes also hit the Houthi-controlled Salif grains port, north of Hodeidah, and two projectiles hit a warehouse and the living quarters of a food production company. 
""Local authorities and company management stated that six injured workers were transferred to local medical facilities for treatment,"" the U.N. mission in Hodeidah, UNMHA, said in a statement on Monday. 
The port of Salif is part of a U.N.-brokered neutral zone on the Red Sea, according to the Stockholm agreement signed in 2018 between Yemen's warring parties.
The Houthi-controlled ministry of commerce and industry said attacks on the port were part of the ""economic warfare against the Yemeni people"".
The Sanaa-based al-Masirah television channel also reported other air strikes in Marib, where heavy fighting has raged over the last few months amid a Houthi offensive to take the gas-producing region.
It added that other strikes hit Hajjah province overnight.
The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 to try to restore the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi that was ousted by the Houthis in 2014.
The war, which has been a military stalemate for years, has killed tens of thousands of people and left millions on the brink of famine.

The government hopes to announce a start date on April 6, Ardern told a news conference, adding that while opening borders with neighbours was a priority, several concerns needed to be resolved first.
""We know that many New Zealanders are nervous...they want us to proceed in the same vein as our overall COVID response, that's with caution.""
Ardern outlined the conditions needed to satisfy the cabinet, such as contact tracing measures and managed isolation facilities, before borders are opened to Australians.
Both countries have successfully contained the coronavirus within their borders, although Australia has suffered sporadic outbreaks.
Most Australian states have opened borders to New Zealanders since last October, with a few short suspensions over small virus outbreaks in Auckland. But New Zealand has delayed returning the favour.
New Zealand's opposition National Party has called for the immediate start of quarantine-free travel with Australia.
""The last thing our struggling economy needs now is more announcements about future announcements,"" party leader Judith Collins said in a statement. 
""The prime minister should have given us the certainty of a start date today.""
Tourism operators in New Zealand who cater to international visitors are struggling, with some having warned their business may not survive much longer if the borders remain shut.
A two-way travel arrangement was in New Zealand's hands, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said this month. 
But Ardern said opening borders without proper systems in place would lead to more lockdowns, putting even domestic tourism at risk.

Parliaments in Canada and the Netherlands drew rebukes from Beijing after they passed non-binding motions in February that said the treatment of China's Uighur Muslim minority constituted genocide.
""The most egregious, systematic abuse of human rights in the world is occurring in Xinjiang,"" said Kevin Andrews, a lawmaker of Australia's ruling Liberal party, moving a private member's motion that drew support from members of all major parties.
In a statement, the Chinese embassy said, ""We flatly reject the ridiculous and absurd rhetoric on Xinjiang by a handful of MPs in today's House session.""
It added, ""Their allegations, based on disinformation and lies and out of political motive, were deliberately made to smear China.""
Andrews cited large-scale internment camps and accusations of forced labour among the reasons for the condemnation from the Dutch and Canadian parliaments, as well as Britain's upper house and U.S. Secretaries of State Mike Pompeo and Antony Blinken. 
Many have said, or questioned if, the ruling Chinese Communist Party's programme contravened the United Nations' genocide convention of 1948, he added.
Andrews' motion urges Australia to enforce laws against modern slavery and identify supply chains that use forced labour. It was not immediately clear when it would be put to a vote.
A Labor MP said many of the 3,000 Uighurs in Australia lived in her electorate, and were desperate and anxious.
""Most Australian Uighurs know someone who has disappeared or not been heard of for many years,"" Anne Stanley, who represents Werriwa in western Sydney, told parliament.
""Those here don't know whether they are alive or dead.""

China initially denied the camps existed, but has since said they are vocational centers and are designed to combat extremism. Late in 2019, it said all people in the camps had ""graduated"".

177,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 01:16AM ET</span>",Explainer: Israel's election - array of contenders seek to topple Netanyahu,"By Maayan Lubell
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel holds its fourth election in two years on Tuesday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hopes the country's world-leading coronavirus vaccine rollout will finally push him through an era of unprecedented political paralysis and into a stable majority.
But Netanyahu, the dominant politician of his generation, is a polarising figure in Israel. And for the first time challengers from across the political spectrum are vying to end the long reign of ""King Bibi"".
FOUR ELECTIONS? WHAT'S THIS ONE ABOUT?
The same as the last three, plus coronavirus.
Netanyahu, 71, is running under the cloud of corruption allegations, which he denies. His trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust has already begun and is expected to resume in April.
On top of that, Israel's economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, and public anger mounted over Netanyahu's handling of the crisis, until the vaccinations began in December.
But Netanyahu's new slogan is ""Vaccination Nation"" and he says he is the only one who could have achieved such a fast inoculation programme.
Israel's longest-serving leader has also trumpeted Israel's diplomatic breakthroughs since August with Gulf countries, Morocco and Sudan, all brokered by the United States.
WHAT DO THE OPINION POLLS SAY?
No clear winner.
Netanyahu's right-wing Likud is expected to emerge as the biggest party, but falling short of a majority in the 120-seat Knesset (parliament) and unable to easily form a coalition government - similar to the three previous elections. 
While surveys show a small majority of Israelis want to see Netanyahu out of office, the fragmented opposition also has no clear path to power, with no single agreed candidate to lead the anti-Netanyahu camp. 
Israel's three main TV stations air exit polls at 10 p.m. (2000 GMT) on Tuesday. Actual results will begin trickling in overnight into Wednesday but final results are expected around Friday. Results have often differed from exit polls. 
WHO ARE NETANYAHU'S RIVALS?
In the past three elections Netanyahu's rivals came from the left. This time around he faces a new challenge from right-wing contenders as well. 
YAIR LAPID, ‮‮57‬‬, a former finance minister and TV host, who leads the centre-left party Yesh Atid - ""There is a Future"". His party, currently in opposition, is predicted to come in second after Likud. 
GIDEON SAAR, 54, a former cabinet minister who quit Likud to set up the New Hope (OTC:NHPEF) party, vowing to end Netanyahu's reign. Like Likud, his party opposes Palestinian statehood, though Saar's campaign has centred on clean government and jump-starting the economy. 
NAFTALI BENNETT, 48, a former Netanyahu aide, cabinet minister and hi-tech millionaire who heads the ultra-hawkish Yamina party and is vying with Saar to be the next leader of the Israeli right. 

BENNY GANTZ, 61, a former general whose Blue and White party was torn apart after he joined Netanyahu in a coalition. He argued the need for a national unity government, but many of his centrist supporters were furious. His popularity plunged and polls show his party may not win any seats.

The minister's visit reaffirmed the close and longstanding special relationship between Singapore and Brunei, the ministry said in a statement.
The statement did not specify any other reason for the visits, but last week Indonesian President Joko Widodo called for an end to bloodshed in military-ruled Myanmar and for Southeast Asian leaders to hold a high-level meeting to try to find a way out of the country's escalating crisis.
Balakrishnan is scheduled to arrive in Malaysia on Tuesday for a two-day visit, where he is expected to discuss bilateral, regional and international issues with counterpart Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia's foreign ministry said.
""Both foreign ministers will also explore post COVID-19 collaboration, including reciprocal vaccination certification, which will benefit both the nations,"" it said in a statement.
Balakrishnan is also scheduled to meet Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin.
Brunei is currently chair of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Myanmar, which is a member of ASEAN, has been locked in crisis since the elected government led by Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1 was overthrown by the military, bringing an end to 10 years of tentative democratic reform.
At least 250 people have now been killed since the military coup, according to figures from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group.

A meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers on March 2 to discuss the crisis failed to make a breakthrough.

(Reuters) - Miami Beach officials voted on Sunday to extend an 8 p.m. curfew and emergency powers for up to three weeks to help control unruly and mostly maskless crowds that have converged on the party destination during spring break.
Thousands of people have packed the city's Art Deco Cultural District causing bedlam and lawlessness in recent days when university students typically celebrate spring break, leading some businesses to close voluntarily out of concern for public safety.
Mayor Dan Gelber told an emergency meeting of the city commission that all manner of out-of-town and out-of-state visitors, not just college students, were filling the streets since Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Feb. 26 called the state an ""oasis of freedom"" from coronavirus restrictions.
""It looked like a rock concert. All you could see was wall to wall people,"" Interim City Manager Raul Aguila told the commission. 
""This is not a typical spring break crowd. ... These are individuals coming into the city ... to engage in lawlessness and anything goes party attitude,"" Aguila said.
Aguila said he noticed a surge on Friday night and imposed emergency powers on Saturday. That included authorities setting a curfew and closing streets in the area, citing in an emergency declaration ""multiple fights, brawls, melees, and other public displays and disturbances of the peace."" 
Officials also restricted eastbound traffic on the three main causeways connecting the city with downtown Miami. 
The commission on Sunday agreed to grant Aguila the authority to extend the measures for up to three more seven-day periods as needed, starting on Tuesday. 
Video and photos posted on social media showed thousands of spring breakers, many eager to let off steam after a year of COVID-19 lockdowns, packed together and dancing in the streets as police struggled to enforce the curfew, firing pepperballs at the crowd.
Police said they had arrested more than 50 people and confiscated eight firearms since Friday, according to a Twitter post on Sunday afternoon.
Hundreds of people reconvened on Sunday night, attempting to recreate the party atmosphere, but police dispersed the crowd, images on social media showed. There were no reports of mass arrests or major confrontations, the Miami Herald reported. 
The Miami Beach Police Department did not respond to a request for comment. 
Gelber said the mass crowds gathered at a time when the surrounding county was experiencing 1,000 new infections of COVID-19 each day and with 50 to 100 people being hospitalized each day.
Many Miami Beach locals took to social media to blame out-of-towners for the chaos. 
""Don't blame Miami for those crowds on South Beach. Nobody who's from Miami goes to South Beach,"" one Twitter user named Silas P. Silas wrote, eliciting approval from fellow residents. 

Concerns over public safety prompted some businesses to close their doors voluntarily during what would normally be among their most profitable days of the year and after months of hardship caused by the pandemic.

""I believe the facts do support those charges,"" said acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin for the District of Columbia. ""I think that, as we go forward, more facts will support that.""
Hundreds of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to stop Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential election victory, sending lawmakers fleeing and leaving five dead. 
The Justice Department has already filed cases against 400 suspects involved in the assault, but none have yet been accused of sedition, the crime of opposing the authority of the U.S. government through force. 

Since announcing a task force to investigate the rioters six days after the attack, Sherwin has said he will pursue sedition charges. So far, most arrested in connection with the riot have been charged with trespassing or assaulting officers, with a smaller number charged with conspiracy to obstruct Congress.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth on Sunday expressed doubts about FBI Director Chris Wray's initial assessment that the fatal shooting of six Asian women in Atlanta-area spas may not constitute a hate crime, saying it ""looks racially motivated."" 
""From where I sit, I want to see a deeper investigation into whether or not these shootings and other similar crimes are racially motivated,"" Duckworth, who is one of only two Asian-Americans currently serving in the U.S. Senate, told CBS ""Face the Nation."" 
""It looks racially motivated to me,"" she said, adding the caveat that she is not a police officer or personally investigating the crimes.
Police in Atlanta are still investigating the motive in connection with the fatal shooting of eight people, six of whom were Asian women, on Tuesday. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is assisting with the investigation.
In an interview with NPR last week, Wray said that it ""does not appear"" that race factored into the mass shooting.
Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, speaking on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" also questioned that assessment, suggesting he believes race played a role. 
""We all know hate when we see it,"" he said. ""It is tragic that we've been visited by this kind of violence yet again.""
The shootings have stoked fears among those in the Asian-American Pacific Islander community, which has reported a spike in hate crimes since March 2020 when then-President Donald Trump began referring to COVID-19 as the ""China virus.""
Suspected gunman Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old Atlanta-area resident who is white, told police that sexual frustration led him to commit the violence.
Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office Captain Jay Baker, who told the media in a press conference that a sexual addiction may have fueled the crime and said Long had had ""a really bad day,"" has since come under criticism from political leaders and civil rights advocates for making insensitive comments. They noted such remarks only fuel stigmas about race, gender and sex work. 
The sheriff's office later acknowledged the remarks had sparked anger, but said Baker never intended to offend anyone. Baker is no longer serving as a spokesman for the case.
The incidence of hate crimes against Asian-Americans rose by 149% in 2020 in 16 major cities compared with 2019, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.
Duckworth is among a growing number of Asian-American lawmakers who have urged law enforcement to more carefully examine the escalating violence. 
""It looks to me that he knew he was going to places where disproportionately the people he shot up would be Asians, and female, and I think the investigators need to really look at these facts,"" Representative Ted Lieu, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told CNN last week, referring to Long.
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris visited Atlanta on Friday to offer support to Asian-Americans and meet with leaders of the community.
Biden on Sunday also highlighted the need to prevent gender-based violence and keep women safe. 
""In the past few weeks, we’ve seen too many examples of horrific and brutal assaults on women, including the tragic murders in Georgia...It hurts all of us, and we all must do more to create societies where women are able to go about their lives free from violence,"" he said in a statement.
The Justice Department has previously said it will step up investigations into hate crimes against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders.

Duckworth said on Sunday she has written a letter to Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland asking them to take a deeper look at whether hate crimes are going under-reported.
A Justice Department spokesman confirmed receiving the letter and said it was under review.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A long white shawl on her head, Rani Khan gives daily Koran lessons at Pakistan's first transgender-only madrasa, or Islamic religious school, which she set up herself using her life savings. 
The madrasa is an important milestone for the LGBTQ community in the overwhelmingly fundamental Muslim country, where transgender people face ostracism, even though there is no official restriction on them attending religious schools or praying at mosques.
""Most families do not accept transgender people. They throw them out of their homes. Transgender people turn to wrongdoing,"" Khan, 34, said, as other transgender people, their heads similarly covered, swayed back and forth behind her, reciting Koran verses. 
""At one time, I was also one of them.""
Holding back tears, Khan recalled how she was disowned by her family at 13 and forced into begging.
At 17, she joined a transgender group, dancing at weddings and other functions, but quit it to connect with her religion after a dream in which a deceased transgender friend and fellow dancer pleaded with her to do something for the community. 
Khan studied the Koran at home, and attended religious schools, before opening the two-room madrasa in October. 
""I'm teaching the Koran to please God, to make my life here and in the hereafter,"" Khan said, explaining how the madrasa offered a place for transgender people to worship, learn about Islam and repent for past actions. 
She says the school has not received aid from the government, although some officials promised to help students find jobs.
Along with some donations, Khan is teaching her students how to sew and embroider, in hopes of raising funds for the school by selling clothing. 
Pakistan's parliament recognised the third gender in 2018, giving such individuals fundamental rights such as the ability to vote and choose their gender on official documents. 
Nonetheless, the transgender remain on the margins in the country, and often have to resort to begging, dancing and prostitution to make a living. 
The madrasa could help trans people assimilate into mainstream society, Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat told Reuters. 
""I'm hopeful that if you replicate this model in other cities, things will improve,"" he said.
A religious school for transgender people has opened in Dhaka, the capital of nearby Bangladesh, and last year a Christian transgender group started its own church in Pakistan's bustling southern port city of Karachi.
Pakistan's 2017 census recorded about 10,000 transgender people, though trans rights groups say the number could now be well over 300,000 in the country of 220 million. 
""It gives my heart peace when I read the Koran,"" said one madrasa student, Simran Khan, who is also eager to learn life skills.

""It is much better than a life full of insults,"" the 19-year-old added.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison looks set to announce a Royal Commission to examine veteran suicides, after a government backbench revolt over delays in establishing an inquiry.
Morrison last year said his government would appoint a permanent national commissioner to investigate suicides among current and former military personnel amid rising public anger over the issue.
After widespread criticism over delays in implementing the scheme, Australia's Senate last week proposed a Royal Commission be established, the most powerful inquiry in Australia, with several ruling backbench lawmakers saying they would support it in a parliamentary vote expected this week.
With Morrison facing an embarrassing defeat, on Monday he looked set to agree to a Royal Commission.
""We can come to some sort of agreement over the course of this week,” Morrison told 2GB Radio.
A Royal Commission is Australia’s most powerful government-appointed inquiry and can compel witnesses to give evidence and recommend prosecutions, but it does not make laws.
The issue of veteran suicide has been prominent in Australia following a high-profile campaign by Julie-Ann Finney, whose son David, a former naval petty officer, committed suicide in 2019.
If a Royal Commission is established, Australia, which has more than 3,000 troops deployed around the world, would join the United States, Britain and Canada in exploring ways to prevent suicide rates among serving and former military personnel.

As of last year, 419 Australian defence personnel have died from suicide since 2001, which is 18% higher than in non-military Australians, according to a government report.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Russian jets hit a gas facility, a cement factory and several towns and cities in northwestern Syria near the Turkish border on Sunday, as Syrian army artillery killed seven civilians and injured 14 medics in an attack on a hospital in the area, witnesses and rebel sources said. 
The sources said a Russian surface-to-surface missile also hit the town of Qah while Russian air strikes came close to densely populated refugee camps along the border with Turkey.
A gas facility was hit near Sarmada city in Idlib province and dozens of trailers carrying goods in a parking lot near the border crossing of Bab al Hawa were set aflame in the latest attack on fuel facilities that serve an economic lifeline for a region that is home to more than four million people.
Western intelligence sources say Russia was behind a ballistic missile strike earlier this month that set ablaze dozens of local oil refineries near the towns of al-Bab and Jarablus further east in a rebel-held area where Turkey holds sway and has a significant military presence.
The spokesman for the National Army, a Turkish-backed rebel alliance in the northwest, said Russia, which backs the government in Damascus, sought to destabilise the last rebel stronghold in Syria and disrupt commercial activity but the strikes did not signal an imminent major assault against Idlib. 
""The Russian aerial strikes are continuing. Ballistic missiles have also hit areas close to civilian centres,"" Major Youssef Hamoud told Reuters. ""They seek to sow chaos and confusion,"" he added. 
Turkey's Defence Ministry said a missile launched by Syrian government forces had struck Qah and a truck and trailer park near Sarmada, injuring seven civilians.
It said a statement had been sent to Russia asking for the attacks to stop immediately and Turkish troops had been alerted.
There was no immediate comment from Moscow.
A woman and a child were among the seven civilians killed when mortar rounds hit the hospital in the city of Atareb.. The Syrian army later shelled rebel-held Ariha town.
The Turkish Defence Ministry said earlier that five people were killed and 10 injured in an artillery attack by Damascus-backed forces on the hospital, one of dozens of hospitals hit by a Russian-led bombing campaign last year.
Videos received by Reuters from two witnesses showed a ward damaged and civil defence rescuers carrying bloodstained patients outside. Reuters could not verify their authenticity.
Fighting between Syrian army forces and rebels has subsided since a deal a year ago ended a Russian-led bombing campaign that had displaced over a million people in the region which borders Turkey after months of fighting that killed several thousand civilians.
Residents say although there have been no major hostilities, the calm is occasionally ruptured by Russian strikes on rebel outposts and by Iranian and Syrian-backed militias shelling towns and cities in the enclave.

Syria and Russia say they only target militant Islamists and deny any indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas or deliberate attacks on hospitals and infrastructure.

An increased number of French, German, Italian and Spanish adults said they considered the vaccine unsafe, YouGov found, although faith in other vaccines by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc was unaffected.
""Not only have we seen considerable rises in those who consider it unsafe in the last two weeks in Europe, the AstraZeneca vaccine continues to be seen as substantially less safe than its Pfizer and Moderna counterparts,"" lead data journalist at YouGov Matt Smith said in a statement.
Sixty-one percent of French adults surveyed said the vaccine was unsafe, a rise of 18 percentage points compared to February, YouGov said.
Just over half of German adults surveyed said they thought the vaccine was unsafe, a rise of 15 percentage points compared to February, while 43% of Italians had serious doubts, an increase of almost a third.
Spain showed a similar increase to Italy in the level of concern, YouGov said. Only in Britain was trust in the vaccine stable.
While the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has investigated reports of unusual blood disorders in recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine, it said last week the benefits outweighed the risks and continues to recommend its use.
This month a series of European countries, including France, Germany and Italy halted its use after Denmark and Norway reporting isolated cases of bleeding, blood clots and a lowplatelet count.
That was the latest setback in the European Union's troubled rollout of vaccines that has been dogged by delays.
As EU nations face a third wave of infections and their vaccination campaigns move more slowly than those of Britain and the United States, health experts have chided EU leaders for poor communication and said the vaccine AstraZeneca developed in partnership with Britain's Oxford University is safe.

BRISTOL, England (Reuters) - Two police officers were seriously injured and at least two police vehicles were set on fire in the city of Bristol in southwest England during violent scenes after a peaceful protest, police said.
Thousands of demonstrators had converged on the city centre, ignoring COVID-19 restrictions, to protest against a government bill going through parliament that would give police new powers to restrict street protests.
The local force, Avon and Somerset Police, said the demonstration began peacefully but was later turned into a violent disorder by a small minority.
Home Secretary Priti Patel, the interior minister, said on Twitter that the scenes in Bristol were unacceptable.
""Thuggery and disorder by a minority will never be tolerated,"" she said. ""Our police officers put themselves in harm's way to protect us all. My thoughts this evening are with those police officers injured.""
Two officers were taken to hospital, one with a broken arm and another with broken ribs, while others were subjected to violence and verbal abuse. The outside of a police station in the city centre was vandalized.
Avon and Somerset Police said it had requested help from neighbouring forces to bring the situation under control.
""All those involved in this criminal behaviour will be identified and brought to justice. There will be significant consequences for behaviour such as this,"" Avon and Somerset's chief superintendent, Will White, said in a statement.
A Reuters photographer at the scene saw some demonstrators launch fireworks towards police officers, try to knock over a police van, scale the outside wall of a police station and spray graffiti on it. 
He also saw police, some in full riot gear, using batons and shields to try to repel protesters.
Some demonstrators carried placards with slogans such as ""Kill the Bill"", ""The Day Democracy Became Dictatorship"" and ""We Can't Be Silenced That Easy"".
The government's Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts bill would give police new powers to impose time and noise limits on street protests.
That has angered activists, particularly since a heavy-handed police response to a London vigil for murder victim Sarah Everard on March 13 caused widespread outrage and criticism of the police. 
A serving police officer has been charged with Everard's kidnap and murder, and the case has unleashed an outpouring of grief and rage over the issue of violence against women and girls. 

The government bill pre-dated the Everard case and covers a wide range of policy areas as well as the policing of protests. However, the two became connected in many people's minds because, by coincidence, the bill was up for debate in parliament two days after the London vigil.

Ahmed al-Deek, an official at Maliki's office, told Reuters the Israeli move was linked to Maliki's meeting with ICC lead prosecutor Fatou Bensouda at her office in The Hague on Thursday.
Israel's Walla news website cited unnamed Israeli officials who said Maliki's ICC visit was the reason for the revocation of his VIP card, an Israeli-granted pass that enables dozens of senior Palestinian officials to move freely through border crossings.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office declined to comment and the Israeli foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

Deek said that the minister left the crossing without the card. It was not clear when it would be returned to him. 
Bensouda announced this month she would formally investigate war crimes in the Palestinian Territories, a move welcomed by the Palestinian Authority and denounced by Israel.

Some 2.2 million people have had both doses of a vaccine, the data showed.
""This mammoth team effort shows the best of Britain,"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted, hailing the second daily record number of doses administered in as many days.
Earlier, the government had given a higher figure for the daily number of vaccine doses administered on Saturday. Hancock said the figure was revised down after adjusted data came in from Scotland, but the new figure was still a UK daily record.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged everyone to accept a vaccine when invited to receive one. 
The daily release of COVID-19 data in the United Kingdom showed that 33 new deaths were recorded on Sunday, the lowest figure since October and down from peaks of well over 1,000 deaths per day in January and February.
The seven-day total number of deaths was 640, down by 37% compared with the previous seven-day period.
New infection numbers were also down, with 5,312 cases reported on Sunday and a seven-day total of 38,145, down by 4% on the previous seven days.
Since the start of the pandemic, a total of 126,155 people have died in the United Kingdom within 28 days of testing positive for COVID-19, the highest official death toll in Europe and the fifth highest in the word.
Britain's vaccine rollout is the fastest in any major economy, although the government has warned that it will slow down next month due to a supply crunch.

Despite the slowdown, progress is still in line with official targets, meaning that unless anything changes the government's four-step plan to ease lockdown is expected to go ahead as announced.

On Sunday, people welcomed the first day of spring by putting on their headphones and busting some moves at Mar Bella beach along Barcelona's famous seafront - all while respecting social distancing regulations. 
""It's been incredible, really cool. I didn't expect there'd be so many people,"" said therapist Andres Mellado, 41.
""At first it seems a bit odd dancing in the middle of Barcelona and people were stopping to look, but it's beautiful ... It's a great thing to do on a Sunday morning, come here and connect a bit to the music,"" he said. 
What started off as a fun meet-up between friends has grown into a regular Sunday morning event, the Tribu Silent Disco (OTC:DSCSY). One took place at the famous Magic Fountain in the neighbourhood of Montjuic. 
""(We asked ourselves) what could we do to boost dancing now that there are so many restrictions? And we had the idea to do it outdoors and with headphones,"" Silent Disco co-founder Xavi Panella told Reuters. 

""First we told friends and acquaintances and then people joined because we do it outdoors and in beautiful places where we don't bother anyone and we maintain a safe distance.""

The protests, the first of any significance against Mario Draghi's national unity government that took office last month, were held in more than 35 squares nationwide including Rome's Piazza del Popolo and Milan's central Piazza Duomo. 
Demonstrators in Rome wore dunce's caps to indicate the impact of the closures on students' education, while in Milan pupils' messages and placards were propped against their school rucksacks placed on the ground. 
Numbers at each venue were limited due to coronavirus restrictions on gatherings.
""Open schools, whatever it takes,"" read one placard held aloft by a child in Rome, in reference to Draghi's famous promise to save the euro when he was European Central Bank chief in 2012. 
Most Italian schools for all ages have been closed since March 15, when Draghi ramped up efforts to control the virus, with students attending lessons online from home.
""We are asking for one thing: that our schools be given the status of essential public services and immediately reopened,"" the Rome arm of the ""Open Schools"" national network that organised the demonstrations said in a statement.
Since Italy's outbreak began 13 months ago schools have closed and re-opened at various times depending on age groups and local infection levels, but overall there has been less face-to-face schooling than in most other European countries.
The latest closures were the last straw for millions of parents forced to work from home or pay for child care. 
The government says the closures are needed due to rising infection rates, and particularly the increasing prevalence of the variant first discovered in the UK, in which contagion is high among younger age groups.

Draghi promised on Friday that schools would be the first thing to reopen when current COVID restrictions are eased.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday urged people to fight organised crime groups such as the mafia around the world, warning that the criminals were using the COVID-19 pandemic to further enrich themselves. 
In December, the Paris-based Interpol police co-ordination issued a global alert warning that organised criminal networks were targeting COVID-19 vaccines. In March, South African police seized hundreds of fake vaccines and arrested four suspects.
""Mafias are present in various part of the world and, taking advantage of the pandemic, they are enriching themselves through corruption,"" Francis said, speaking at his Sunday noon address on the day Italy remembers victims of organised crime.
Italian police say crime clans are using the pandemic to buy favour with poor families facing financial ruin, offering loans and food. Mob loan sharks demanding exorbitant interest rates are bailing out businesses hit by the pandemic, police say.
""These structures of sin, mafia structures, are against the gospel and mistake idolatry for faith,"" the pope added.
In Italy, many members of organised crime see themselves as part of a religious, cult-like group, invoking the help of saints and using religious figurines or statues in initiation rites.
The southern town of Oppido Mamertina made headlines in 2014 when locals carrying a statue of the Madonna diverted the route of a procession to pause at the home of a mob boss and tilted the statue slightly as if to kneel in a sign of respect.
""Today, let us remember all the victims and renew our commitment against mafias,"" Francis said.

In recent years, the Calabria-based 'Ndrangheta has overtaken Sicily's Cosa Nostra as the most feared and lucrative Italian crime group, making most of its money from drug trafficking. It has spread throughout the world.

The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden is exploring ways to restore the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran signed with major world powers, but which was abandoned in 2018 by President Donald Trump, who reimposed sanctions. Iran retaliated by breaching the terms of the accord in a step-by-step response. 
The United States and the other Western powers that signed up to the 2015 deal appear to be at odds with Tehran over which side should return to the accord first, making it unlikely that U.S. sanctions which have crippled Iran's economy can be quickly removed. 
""We trusted America at the time of (former U.S. President Barack) Obama and fulfilled our commitments. But they didn’t. The Americans said on paper that sanctions will be lifted, but they didn’t lift sanctions in practice,"" Khamenei said in a speech on state TV. ""Their promises have no credibility for us.""
""On paper they said the sanctions were lifted but they told any company that wanted to sign a contract with us that this was dangerous and risky. They scared away investors,"" Khamenei said. 
""The Americans must lift all sanctions. We will verify it and if sanctions are ... really cancelled, we will return to our obligations without any problems,"" Khamenei said. ""We have a lot of patience and we are not in a hurry.""
Khamenei, who has the final say in matters of state, said Iranian planners should act on a worst-case scenario that sanctions would not be lifted soon.

""You should assume that sanctions will remain in place and plan the country's economy based on sanctions,"" Khamenei said, addressing current officials and those who might take over after the country's presidential election in June.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - U.S. and European leaders denounced what they called Turkey's baffling and concerning decision to pull out of an international accord designed to protect women from violence, and urged President Tayyip Erdogan to reconsider.
Erdogan's government on Saturday withdrew from the Istanbul Convention, which it signed onto in 2011 after it was forged in Turkey's biggest city. Turkey said domestic laws, not outside fixes, would protect women's rights.
The Council of Europe accord pledged to prevent, prosecute and eliminate domestic violence and promote equality. Killings of women have surged in Turkey in recent years and thousands of women protested on Saturday against the government's move in Istanbul and other cities. 
The United States, Germany, France and the European Union responded with dismay - marking the second time in four days that Europe's leaders have criticised Ankara over rights issues, after a Turkish prosecutor moved to close down a pro-Kurdish political party.
U.S. President Joe Biden said Turkey's withdrawal from the accord was ""deeply disappointing"" and a step backward in efforts to end violence against women globally. 
""Around the world, we are seeing increases in the number of domestic violence incidents, including reports of rising femicide in Turkey,"" Biden said in a statement on Sunday. ""Countries should be working to strengthen and renew their commitments to ending violence against women, not rejecting international treaties designed to protect women and hold abusers accountable."" 
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said late on Saturday that the decision was incomprehensible and ""risks compromising the protection and fundamental rights of women and girls in Turkey (and) sends a dangerous message across the world. ... We therefore cannot but urge Turkey to reverse its decision.""
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen - who spoke with Erdogan a day before Turkey ditched the pact - wrote on Twitter on Sunday: ""Women deserve a strong legal framework to protect them,"" and she called on all signatories to ratify it.
The Council of Europe, which gathers 47 members states and was founded in 1949 to defend human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe, also regretted the decision.
""Leaving the Convention would deprive Turkey and Turkish women of a vital tool to counter violence,"" the presidents of the organisation's Committee of ministers and of the Parliamentary assembly said on Sunday in a joint statement.
The convention had split Erdogan's ruling AK Party (AKP) and even his family. Officials floated pulling out last year amid a dispute over how to curb domestic violence in Turkey, where femicide has tripled in 10 years, one monitoring group has said.
But many conservatives in Turkey and in Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AKP say the pact undermines family structures, encouraging violence. Some are also hostile to its stance against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. 
Paris said Turkey's withdrawal marked a new regression in respect for human rights, while Berlin said neither culture, religion nor tradition could ""serve as an excuse for ignoring violence against women"".
The diplomatic strain comes after Europe and the United States this past week said the move to close down parliament's third-largest party, the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), undermined democracy in Turkey.
In their video call on Friday, Erdogan, Von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel discussed a dispute, which has cooled, over offshore resources in the eastern Mediterranean.

An EU summit this week will address relations with Ankara.

One man was killed and several were wounded when police opened fire on a group setting up a barricade in the central town of Monywa, a doctor there said as a community group issued a call on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for blood donors.
The violence that has followed a Feb. 1 coup, which came after a decade of tentative steps towards democracy in Myanmar, has forced many citizens to think up novel ways to make their stand as they resist a return to military rule.
Protesters in nearly 20 places across the country staged candle-lit protests on Saturday night and Sunday night, from the main city of Yangon to small communities in Kachin State in the north, Hakha town in the west and the southernmost town of Kawthaung, according to a tally of social media posts.
Hundreds of people in the second city of Mandalay, including many medical staff in white coats, marched before sunrise in a ""Dawn protest"", video posted by the Mizzima news portal showed.
""Failure of the military regime, our cause our cause ... federal democracy, our cause our cause,” the crowd chanted as the sky was beginning to brighten and birds called from the trees lining the otherwise deserted streets.
Protesters in some places were joined by Buddhist monks holding candles while some people used candles to make the shape of the three-fingered protest salute.
Others came out later on Sunday, including the crowd in Monywa, where police opened fire.
""Sniper, sniper,"" people can be heard shouting in a video clip shortly after the man was shot in the head and more shots rang out.
The spokesman for the junta was not available for comment but has previously said security forces have used force only when necessary.
With the latest killing, the death toll since the coup rose to at least to 248, based on a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group.
State media said on Sunday that men on motorbikes attacked a member of the security forces who later died. The military said two policemen were killed in earlier protests.
'FOREIGN INSULTS'
The junta says a Nov. 8 election won by Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's party was fraudulent, an accusation rejected by the electoral commission. The military leaders have promised a new election but have not set a date.
Western countries have repeatedly condemned the coup and the violence. Asian neighbours, who have for years avoided criticising each other, have also begun speaking out.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, in some of the strongest comments yet by a regional leader, said on Friday the violence should stop immediately. He called for an urgent meeting of Southeast Asia's regional grouping, of which Myanmar is a member.
Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin backed the call, saying he was appalled by the persistent use of lethal violence against civilians. Singapore has also expressed disapproval.
The military has shown no sign of being pressed into back-tracking on its coup, which derailed a slow transition to democracy in a country that was under strict military rule from a 1962 coup until the generals initiated reforms a decade ago.
Coup leader General Min Aung Hlaing on Saturday visited the Coco islands, one of Myanmar's most strategically important outposts, 400 km (250 miles) south of Yangon, and reminded members of the armed force there that their main duty was to defend the country against external threats.
The state-run Kyemon newspaper prominently featured a quote from independence hero Aung San, Suu Kyi's father, who in 1947 said: ""It is everyone's duty to sacrifice their lives and defend and fight back against foreign countries' insults.""
Suu Kyi, 75, faces accusations of bribery and other crimes that could see her banned from politics and jailed if convicted. Her lawyer says the charges are trumped up.

Australia's SBS News reported that two Australian business consultants were detained as they tried to leave Myanmar, but it was not clear why. The broadcaster quoted an Australian foreign ministry spokeswoman as declining to comment on the two for privacy reasons.

KABUL (Reuters) - United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in an unnanounced visit to Kabul on Sunday,as Washington reviews the peace process there and its planned troop withdrawal.
Austin said on Twitter he had come to ""listen and learn"", on his first trip to Afghanistan since his appointment. 
""This visit been very helpful for me, and it will inform my participation in the review we are undergoing here with (U.S. President Joe Biden),"" he added.
The meeting comes at a crucial time for the Afghan peace process ahead of a May 1 deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops agreed by the insurgent Taliban and the administration of previous U.S. President Donald Trump.
Biden told ABC News on Wednesday that the deadline would be tough to meet and that his administratiin was consulting with allies and in the process of making a decision.
The United States special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, has also been travelling in the region in recent weeks with proposals including an interim Afghan government and a summit in Turkey to jumpstart the peace process. 
Negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government in Qatar's capital Doha have struggled to gain momentum and violence has risen. 
The Taliban said on Friday they would like to see the process sped up but warned Washington against keeping troops in Afghanistan beyond their agreed withdrawal date.

Afghanistan's presidential palace said on Sunday Austin and Ghani discussed the peace process and concerns over rising violence.

Islamic State said in a statement that its fighters captured three vehicles as well as weapons and ammunition, according to SITE.

A court spokeswoman said she believed it was Israel's first ruling on COVID-19 policy in the workplace, though it could still be overturned on appeal. 
Some Israeli schools, in reopening, have required that their staff show proof either of vaccination or negative once-weekly COVID-19 tests. 
The teaching assistant, Sigal Avishai, refused to give proof of either, citing her right to privacy and freedom of conscience. Barred from school in response, she turned to the court last month, arguing she had suffered de-facto suspension. 
""We do not, at this time, believe that the apparent rights of the appellant outweigh the right and duty of the respondent to care for the welfare of their pupils, educational staff and pupils' parents,"" the court said, ruling in favour of the school board for the town of Kochav Yair-Tzur Yigal. 
Avishai had argued that the school's policy was an unlawful breach of her medical privacy and that she was being ""pressured to get vaccinated against her beliefs"", the court said. Israel's world-beating vaccination programme has left authorities with the dilemma of how to balance public health with the rights of a minority who have refused vaccines. 
Several activities have been deemed off-limits to the unvaccinated, angering those who cannot get the shot for health reasons, or refuse it either for religious reasons or scepticism over vaccines. 
More than 55% of Israelis have received at least one dose of the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) vaccine and almost 49% have received the full two-dose regime, the Health Ministry says. 

Israel has logged a steep drop in cases and hospital admissions.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Christina Kelly did not picture marrying her American sweetheart in the Peace Arch Park - a 42-acre (17-hectare) stretch of manicured lawns and neatly trimmed garden beds at an otherwise unremarkable border crossing in the Pacific Northwest.
Kelly, a 28-year-old Canadian legal assistant from Vancouver, had been crossing back and forth between British Columbia and Washington state to see her boyfriend without a hitch for two years.
The start of the coronavirus pandemic, and the closure of the Canada-U.S. border in March 2020, forced a change of plans.
Where many couples have reluctantly put off weddings, Kelly and her now-husband, who is in the U.S. Navy, decided to proceed anyway and tied the knot two months ago in the one place where they have been able to see each other during the past year.
""We would have gotten married at some point,"" she said. ""But (COVID-19) had to speed things up.""
It ""wasn't my ideal wedding,"" Kelly said, recalling how she shivered in her white wedding dress in the cold and muddy park, as her mother, the groom's mother and some of the couple's friends from both sides of the border looked on.
But she now realizes that it was, in some ways, the perfect setting. ""The park has been my life for the past year, (the only place) where I can see my husband. For us to be able to get married there, it was very memorable.""
In pre-pandemic times the Peace Arch Park was little more than a pit stop for travelers and commercial traffic as well as a picturesque picnic spot where families from nearby border towns gathered.
With the closure of the border last year, a move that initially barred all but essential workers from crossing, the park has become a lifeline for couples in cross-border relationships.
British Columbia closed its side of the park in June, but the American side remains open. Canadians are able to enter Washington state by parking in a residential area and walking about half a mile (800 meters) before crossing a shallow ditch dividing the two sides.
It was not immediately clear why Canadian residents are still permitted to come back into the country via the U.S. side of the park without having to comply with Canada's border measures, including mandatory negative COVID-19 tests and a 14-day quarantine.
Public Safety Canada, the ministry responsible for border security, referred Reuters to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who said visitors to the park ""should expect to adhere"" to mandatory quarantine orders, and that their Federal Border Integrity Program had ""increased enforcement of the area.""
But it remains possible to exit the park from the U.S. side without encountering an official port of entry, at which Canadian border officials would enforce the requirements.
As a result, the park has become the staging ground for the kind of milestone events that are hard if not impossible to arrange as the two nations try to curb the spread of COVID-19 - dates, birthday parties, family gatherings and, of course, weddings.
'RELATIONSHIP-SAVER'
Peace Arch Park saw its visitor numbers more than double to almost 140,000 in 2020, according to the Washington State Park Service (WSPS), which manages the American side of the park. Visitors began streaming in from the very beginning of the border closure, said Amber Forest, area manager for the WSPS.
The weddings soon followed. Roughly seven were held in the park in 2019, according to the WSPS. That number soared in 2020, with five weddings held every weekday and two dozen every weekend for much of the year.
Tents also began appearing, as families gathered for barbecues and long-distance couples pitched shelters for conjugal visits, occasionally piercing expensive irrigation lines with stabilizing pegs.
Access to the park is constantly under threat. Some Canadian politicians have recently renewed calls for their U.S. counterparts to shut off access from the American side, but Washington state has not acted so far.
Regan Steele, 41, has her trip to Peace Arch Park from her home in Marysville, located about 80 miles (130 km) south of the border, down to a science: she packs a tent, portable heater, coffee for her and hot chocolate for her Canadian boyfriend of six years, Rod Greenwood.
Every weekend they set up camp and do a puzzle together while listening to music and talking.
The park has been ""a relationship-saver,"" Steele said, even if it's hard not to think ""over this last year that we've just missed so much time together.""
But she tries not to dwell on any regrets.
""Once I start thinking that, I'm like, 'You're lucky, Regan,'"" Steele said. ""You have this option. So many people don't have this option.""
As for Kelly and her husband, they are continuing to meet in the park as a married couple every weekend until he moves to Canada, going for walks past the copse where they were married.
Once the border reopens, Kelly doesn't think they'll return for a while.

""I've had enough of the park for now,"" she said. ""It'd be nice to just be with my husband.""

The explosion at the 36-inch pipeline providing natural gas to the Pigap II gas reinjection plant in northern Monagas state prompted PDVSA to temporarily shut the plant in order to halt the flames and evaluate the damages to the pipeline, according to the report. 
Oil Minister Tareck El Aissami in a brief statement on state television late on Saturday called the incident a ""terrorist attack,"" without providing details about who was responsible or about the impact on the plant and pipeline. 
OPEC-member Venezuela is home to massive crude and natural gas reserves but has seen output tumble to decades-low levels in recent years amid a nationwide economic collapse that has reduced PDVSA's cash flow and led to an exodus of qualified personnel.

Officials have in the past blamed explosions at pipelines and refineries, as well as blackouts and other infrastructure failings, on attacks aimed at sabotaging the country's economy. Critics say the incidents are due to chronic lack of maintenance, underinvestment and mismanagement.

Alfred Sauter, a member of the wealthy southeastern state's parliament, is being investigated by prosecutors over allegations he took bribes in return for helping arrange public mask procurement contracts during the coronavirus pandemic. 
Sauter denies the allegations.
""We are at a fork in the road,"" Bavarian premier Markus Soeder, the leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU) and a front-runner to be the conservative candidate to replace Merkel as chancellor, told a news conference on Sunday. ""Our party's credibility is at stake.""
As well as being a member of the CSU's state parliamentary group, Sauter was a member of the party's board and chair of his constituency party. For a quarter of a century he has been a mover-and-shaker in the party - which has a decades-old alliance with Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) - and served for a period as Bavaria's justice minister.
He is at least the third conservative politician to have left their jobs in the scandal over mask procurement kickbacks.
His departure from all his roles was first reported as his own decision by the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper, though he later told the same paper that he had his posts taken from him. 
""My exclusion from the group is a serious violation in the constitutional status of a legislator,"" he told the newspaper.
With a national election due in September, at which voters will choose a replacement for Merkel, who is not running for a historic fifth term, the affair comes at the worst possible time for the conservative bloc.
A Kantar poll on Sunday showed support for the CDU-CSU ticket at 27%, just five points ahead of the second-placed Greens. In May, when Merkel was winning plaudits for her management of the pandemic, support stood at 40%.
Soeder said the party's legislators would in future have to make a choice between political office and business, and those who refused to declare their interests in full would not be allowed to run for office.
""People must decide: is your focus the public office or private economic interests,"" he said.

""If it will be necessary to use the ultimate constitutional tool, the requisitioning of personal services, I will not hesitate to do it,"" Mitsotakis said in an interview in Sunday's To Vima newspaper.
With Greece's public hospitals overwhelmed by surging COVID-19 infections and intensive care wards running out of beds, the government had called on private sector doctors to help out, saying 200 were needed.
So far only about 55 have heeded the call, the ERT state broadcaster said.
""I cannot imagine colleagues who took the Hippocratic oath not wanting to come and help these people in their battle (against COVID-19),"" Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias, himself a medical doctor, said on Saturday outside a public hospital. 
On Saturday Greek health authorities reported 2,535 new coronavirus cases and 60 deaths, bringing total cases to 235,611 with 7,421 deaths.
Mitsotakis told the paper that cooperation is always preferable as a first step and that obliging doctors to offer their services is not sufficient. 
""We have to inspire them to do it,"" he said.

The government will start distributing free do-it-yourself COVID-19 tests next month, seeking to alleviate pressure on a healthcare system facing a stubbornly high level of new infections.

He entered a plea of not guilty, court officials said.
Schembri resigned in November 2019, shortly after Yorgen Fenech, a close friend of his, was charged with masterminding the murder of anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in October 2017. Fenech pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial.
Prime Minister Muscat resigned two months later. 
Court officials said charges against Schembri on Saturday are not connected to the Caruana Galizia murder case.
Schembri, Muscat and Fenech have all denied involvement in the murder and no charges related to it have been made against Schembri or Muscat. 
The charges against Schembri stem from a magistrates' investigation after Schembri's company won a multimillion-euro contract in 2010 to sell a printing press to Allied Newspapers, publishers of Times of Malta, the country's biggest-selling newspaper.
Caruana Galizia had written about alleged money laundering in a 2016 blog post about the contract. Her family, who were present in the courtroom on Saturday, welcomed the arraignment but said it was overdue. 
""Prosecuting Schembri today brings us a step closer to a Malta where no one is above the law,"" they said in a statement.
In a lengthy Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Thursday, Schembri said the accusations against him, which were already circulating in the media, were an ""establishment plot"" and he looked forward to clearing his name.

Political tensions have risen in Northern Ireland, with the pro-British unionist community unhappy about new barriers to trade with the rest of the United Kingdom that have arisen since Brexit fully took effect on Jan. 1.

""We're in a difficult place but we are equal partners and we will have to sit down, hopefully, as you suggest, reduce the temperature and find solutions because business knows no borders, the business people in Northern Ireland want a solution,"" McGuinness said in an interview on the BBC.

211,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2021 06:00AM ET</span>",Russian envoy says UK nuclear arms plan is illegal,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's ambassador to Britain has accused the UK government of breaking its international treaty commitments with a plan to increase the country's nuclear arsenal and said the political relationship between Moscow and London is ""nearly dead"".
In a foreign and defence policy review published on Tuesday and endorsed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Britain said it needed to increase its nuclear arsenal in the face of evolving global security threats.
Britain said it would raise the upper limit on its nuclear warhead stock to 260 from 180. The same report also classified Russia as ""the most acute threat to our security"" in the Euro-Atlantic region.
The Kremlin said at the time that it regretted the British nuclear decision, which it suggested would harm international stability, while the Russian foreign ministry described the move as a serious blow to international arms control.
Andrei Kelin, Russia's ambassador to Britain, went further in an interview due to be broadcast on the London-based LBC radio station on Sunday, saying the plan looked illegal. 
""You are increasing the number of warheads by 40%. This is a violation of the treaty of non-proliferation and many, many other agreements that are saying only a decline or a reduction in the number of nukes,"" Kelin told LBC, according to a partial transcript on the radio station's website.
The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which Britain has ratified, came into force in 1970. The UK government has said its plans do not violate the pact. 
Russian news agencies cited Kelin as saying that political relations between London and Moscow, which have become strained from events from Russia's jailing of opposition politician Alexei Navalny to the poisoning in 2018 of a Russian double agent and his daughter, were ""nearly dead"". 

They cited Kelin as saying that only cultural and economic ties remained, while LBC cited him as saying that the last time he had spoken to British foreign minister Dominic Raab was in December 2019.

A Revolutionary Guards statement quoted by the agency blamed what it called terrorist groups for the blast in a square in Saravan, near the border with Pakistan. 
Earlier this month a U.N. human rights spokesman said at least a dozen people and possibly up to 23 had been killed in Saravan and other parts of Sistan-Baluchestan province where Revolutionary Guards and security forces used lethal force against fuel couriers from ethnic minorities, and protesters.
The shooting of people carrying fuel across the border led to protests that spread from Saravan to other areas of Sistan-Baluchestan, including the capital, Zahedan.
Sistan-Baluchestan’s population is predominantly Sunni Muslim, while most Iranians are Shi’ite. Iran has some of the lowest fuel prices in the world and there is some fuel-smuggling to neighbouring countries.
The impoverished province has long been the scene of sporadic clashes between security forces and separatist militants and smugglers carrying opium from Afghanistan, the word's top producer of the drug.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - More than 30 civilians and police were injured in anti-government protests in Thailand, an emergency medical centre said on Sunday after police used water cannon, teargas and rubber bullets to disperse the rally the night before.
Video circulated on social media showed police hitting and stomping on people with others fleeing from police in riot gear and some abandoning their motorcycles. Another video showed people taking refuge from teargas in a McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) restaurant.
Thirteen police officers and 20 others were injured, the Erawan Medical Centre said.
Police said on Sunday their actions were in accordance with international standards and that 20 protesters were arrested for breaking public gathering laws and insulting the monarchy.
""Violence originated from the protesters' side and police have to defend the law and protect national treasures,"" the deputy head of the Bangkok police, Piya Tavichai, told reporters.
Protesters disagreed.
""Violence came from the police first, using tear gas and water cannons before protesters did anything,"" said activist Rukchanok Srinork, 27, who was at the rally. 
""They have helmets, shields, crowd control training, if there is a stone, raise your shields."" 
Portraits of the king were defaced at Saturday night's protests, which drew well over 1,000 people.
An anti-government protest this month saw over 20 protesters injured.
Thailand's youth protest movement emerged last year and has posed the biggest challenge for the government of Prime Minster Prayuth Chan-ocha, a retired army general who seized power in 2014 from an elected government.
Protesters say he engineered a process that preserved the military-monarchy establishment and kept him in power after a 2019 election. Prayuth and his supporters reject that assertion.
The protesters have demanded reform of the monarchy, breaking a traditional taboo, saying the constitution drafted by the military after the 2014 coup gives the king too much power.

The Royal Palace, which declined to comment on Sunday, has avoided commenting directly on the protests. The government has said criticism of the king is unlawful and inappropriate.

The Russian Foreign Ministry announced on Wednesday it was recalling its ambassador, Anatoly Antonov, for urgent talks after Biden said in an ABC interview he thought President Putin was a killer who would ""pay a price"" for alleged U.S. election meddling - an accusation that Moscow denies. 
Putin responded to Biden by citing a Russian children's playground chant that ""he who said it, did it"", and offered to hold live online talks with the U.S. president, a proposal Biden has not so far taken up.
The Russian embassy in Washington's social media accounts posted a picture of Antonov in the early hours of Sunday morning at a U.S. airport, with an Aeroflot plane idling on the runway. 
""Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov is on his way to Moscow to participate in consultations on rectifying Russia-U.S. relations,"" the embassy said. 
Both countries have said they will only cooperate when it is in their national interest to do so. 
State TV's First Channel said Antonov told reporters before boarding his plane that there a was a lot of work for the Russian foreign ministry and others to do, but that he had no doubt that keeping lines of communication open was in the interests of the American people.
The channel then read out what it said were excerpts of letters sent to Antonov by Americans before his departure, apologising for Biden's comments about Putin.

TASS said a plane carrying Antonov had touched down at Moscow's Sheremtyevo airport on Sunday morning.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Hundreds of people from Taiwan's Myanmar community rallied in central Taipei on Sunday to denounce the coup there, singing defiant songs and holding white and red roses in mourning for those who have died protesting the military.
Taiwan is home to around 40,000 people originally from Myanmar, most of whom are ethnic Chinese. Some are descendents of Nationalist troops trapped in Myanmar, then called Burma, at the end of China's civil war in 1949. Others have come more recently, fleeing repression and anti-Chinese sentiment.
Dressed in white, the colour of mourning, holding pictures of detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi and signs condemning the coup, around 400 people protested at Taipei's Liberty Square, mainly Sino-Burmese but also non-Chinese Myanmar citizens, Taiwanese and Hong Kongers.
""People in Myanmar are once again forced to live under the dark shadow of the military regime. As an emigrant from Myanmar, today we gather here to pay tribute to our fellow countrymen and those fallen heroes,"" Yangon-born Thomas Chen, 28, a teacher of Burmese at Taipei's Soochow University, told the crowd.
People sang ""We Won't Be Satisfied Until The End Of The World"", the Burmese-language anthem from the country's 1988 pro-democracy uprising, brutally put down by the military government of the time, and bowed their heads in prayer to remember the dead.
Hung Sun-han, a lawmaker for Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party, criticised China for supporting the coup. Beijing denies this, though many people in Myanmar view China as supporting the junta that seized power on Feb. 1.
""We know that behind this military coup there are forces from Chinese Communist. This is the thing that people can't stand the most,"" Hung told protesters.
Last Sunday saw arson attacks against 32 Chinese-invested companies in the Yangon suburb of Hlaingthaya, though demonstrators in Taipei who spoke to Reuters played down fears of wider anti-Chinese feelings.

""Many ethnic Chinese are on the streets protesting against the coup,"" said Wei Lin, who lived through anti-Chinese riots in Yangon in 1967. ""People know how to distinguish between Chinese-Burmese and the Chinese government.""

216,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2021 03:52AM ET</span>",Heavy rains in Australia's east bring worst floods in 50 years,"By Lidia Kelly
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Heavy rains along Australia's east coast over the weekend have brought the worst flooding in half a century in some areas, authorities said on Sunday, forcing thousands to evacuate and damaging hundreds of houses.
New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the downpour across the state, Australia's most populous with 8 million people, was worse than initially expected, especially for low-lying areas in Sydney's northwest.
""Yesterday, we were hoping it will only be a one-in-20-year event, now it looks like a one-in-50-year event,"" Berejiklian said at a televised briefing.
People in parts of Sydney's northwest were ordered to flee their houses in the middle of the night as fast-moving waters caused widespread destruction. Late on Sunday, about another 1,000 people were asked to evacuate, after Berejiklian said that some 4,000 people may be asked to leave their houses.
Television and social media footage showed fast-moving water unmooring houses, engulfing roads, breaking trees and damaging road infrastructure. Emergency services estimate the total number of damaged houses to be ""in the hundreds"". 
Several major roads were closed across the state while many schools called off classes for Monday.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post announced federal financial assistance for those affected.
The flooding comes in stark contrast with the devastating bushfires that struck Australia in late 2019 and early 2020, when nearly 7% of NSW land was scorched.
Flooding risk and evacuation warnings were in place for about 13 areas in NSW, including the Hunter, one of Australia's major wine regions. 
Several dams, including Warragamba, Sydney’s main water supply, spilled over causing river levels to surge. 
Meteorologists said the downpour is set to continue for several days. Emergency crews have responded to about 6,000 calls for help since the start of the rains on Thursday, including nearly 700 direct pleas for rescue from floods.
The extreme weather has also affected Australia's COVID-19 vaccine delivery to across NSW, disrupting the country's plans to deliver the first doses to almost 6 million people over the next few weeks.
On Sunday, Australia's medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), granted approval for locally produced AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccines.

The Australian government has purchased 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to be manufactured locally.

Majan Sahidjuan, alias Apo Mike, was severely wounded in a gunbattle with the marines on Saturday night in Languyan town in southern Tawi-Tawi province, and later died, said Lieutenant General Corleto Vinluan Jr.
He described Sahidjuan as the mastermind in several kidnappings by Abu Sayyaf, which is based in Sulu and has also been involved in bomb attacks and piracy for decades. Since 2014, it has proclaimed allegiance to the Islamic State group.
""We are happy that all the hostages are safe now and we are also able to neutralize the notorious 'Apo Mike' and two of his comrades,"" said Vinluan, commander of the military's Western Mindanao Command. 
Sahidjuan was among five Abu Sayyaf militants who went to Tawi-Tawi by boat from Sulu, with their four Indonesian kidnap victims last Thursday.
Their boat capsized after it was battered by big waves, giving government troops the chance to rescue three of the four hostages - Arizal Kasta Miran, 30; Arsad Bin Dahlan, 41; and Andi Riswanto, 26. 
The fourth, 15-year-old Mohd Khairuldin, was found by government troops in the same village where the gunbattle took place.
The four hostages were among five Indonesians kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf on Jan. 17 last year off Tambisan in Malaysia. One of the five was killed while trying to escape.

U.S. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin brought up the issue when he met with Japanese Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi on Tuesday although there was no discussion on the specifics of how the two countries should coordinate responses to such an emergency, the news outlet reported.
Japan has historically refrained from commenting on potential emergency situations in Taiwan in relation to China and its stance remains to ""encourage dialogue for a peaceful solution to cross-strait tensions,"" Kyodo said.
Austin and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met their counterparts in Tokyo last week in what was the first overseas visit by top members of President Joe Biden's cabinet.
In a joint statement issued with Japan, Austin and Blinken said, ""China's behaviour, where inconsistent with the existing international order, presents political, economic, military and technological challenges to the alliance and to the international community.""

219,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2021 02:05AM ET</span>",Pro-Kurdish MP detained after four nights holed up at Turkey's parliament,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police detained pro-Kurdish lawmaker Omer Faruk Gergerlioglu from his party's headquarters in parliament early on Sunday, where he had been staying for four nights to protest the stripping of his MP status over a separate case.
The Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) said he was in pyjamas and slippers when police seized him just before his morning prayers in Ankara, and released a video and court document detailing the latest charges against the party.
Turkey's third-largest party has faced a years-long crackdown culminating Wednesday when a top prosecutor moved to shutter it over alleged links to Kurdish militants - charges the HDP denies as a ""political coup"".
Hours before that move parliament had stripped Gergerlioglu, a human rights activist, of his MP status and related protections over an earlier conviction for spreading terrorist propaganda by sharing a news story link on Twitter.
He intended to remain holed up at the HDP's parliament offices. 
But police seized him, the court document said, in order to get a statement related to a new investigation launched over alleged chants heard on Wednesday amid party members' move from the General Assembly to the HDP's headquarters.
The chant ""Long live leader Apo"" was allegedly heard, the document said - an apparent reference to Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) founder Abdullah Ocalan, jailed since 1999. The PKK is deemed a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union.
As part of the new probe, police determined that Gergerlioglu was ""still acting like an MP"" and that, unlawfully, he did not leave a state building, the document said.
Turkey's Western allies condemned the move to shut the HDP, while President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party, which has a parliamentary majority with nationalists, defended it. Thousands of Turkish Kurds rallied Saturday in Istanbul in support of the HDP.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2021 12:30AM ET</span>",Philippines says 220 Chinese militia vessels seen in disputed waters this month,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines expressed concern about hundreds of Chinese military vessels it said were spotted this month in the disputed South China Sea, the latest example of tension in the crucial waterway.
The Philippine Coast Guard reported that some 220 vessels, believed to be manned by Chinese maritime militia personnel, were seen moored in line formation at a reef on March 7, a cross-government task force said late on Saturday.
Foreign minister Teodoro Locsin, asked whether he would file a diplomatic protest over the ships' presence, told a journalist on Twitter: ""Only if the generals tell me. In my watch foreign policy is the fist in the iron glove of the armed forces.""
The National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea expressed concern about overfishing and destruction of the marine environment, as well as risks to safety of navigation.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday, and calls to the Chinese embassy in Manila seeking comment went unanswered.
An international tribunal in 2016 invalidated China's claim to 90% of the South China Sea, but Beijing does not recognise the ruling. China in recent years has built islands in the disputed waters, putting air strips on some of them.
Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei all claim parts of the sea.
In January, the Philippines protested a new Chinese law allowing its coastguard to fire on foreign vessels, describing it as a ""threat of war"".
The United States has repeatedly denounced what it called China's attempts to bully neighbours with competing interests, while Beijing has criticised Washington for what it calls interference in its internal affairs.
The Chinese vessels were at the Julian Felipe Reef, also called Whitsun Reef, in Manila's exclusive economic zone, the task force said, describing the site as ""a large boomerang-shaped shallow coral reef at the northeast of Pagkakaisa Banks and Reefs.""
""Despite clear weather at the time, the Chinese vessels massed at the reef showed no actual fishing activities and had their full white lights turned on during night time,"" it said in a statement.
The Philippines vowed to monitor the situation and ""to peacefully and proactively pursue its initiatives on environmental protection, food security and freedom of navigation"" in the South China Sea.

221,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2021 09:46PM ET</span>",Hundreds in Atlanta rally to support Asian Americans after fatal shootings,"(Reuters) - Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta on Saturday in support of the Asian American community after a shooting at three local day spas this week left eight people dead, six of them Asian women.
The killings followed a year of mounting anti-Asian violence in the United States, which community leaders say is due to Asian Americans being blamed for the coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.
Crowds of people wearing masks, waving American flags and carrying posters that read ""We are not the virus"" and ""Stop Asian Hate"" stood in front of the golden-domed Georgia State Capitol building on Saturday.
""I want to make sure the world and the people know that I am here and I am visible,"" said rally-goer Sunghee Han from Georgia.
""The women who perished, ... I see my family in them,"" Timothy Phan from Port St. Lucie, Florida, who drove eight hours to attend, told CNN. ""I feel like far too often, we're just erased.""
Georgia Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, both Democrats elected in January, led the demonstrators in a moment of silence for the victims, video on Twitter showed.
""Let us build a state and a nation where no one lives in fear because of who they are or where they or their family come from,"" Senator Ossoff said.
Georgia authorities have yet to determine what drove the suspect, a 21-year-old white man, who was charged with the killings at spas in and around Atlanta on Tuesday. Robert Aaron Long told investigators sex addiction led him to violence, but lawmakers and anti-racism advocates have said anti-Asian bias could have been at least part of the motivation.
""I'm not interested in whether or not he had a bad day,"" said Warnock, blasting a comment by an Atlanta-area sheriff's department spokesman about Long's state of mind.
""No matter how you want to spin it, the facts remain the same,"" Georgia State Representative Bee Nguyen told the crowd. ""This was an attack on the Asian community.""
Some of the women killed were immigrants and mothers, described by family and friends as hard-working, loving and beloved.
Hyun Jung Grant was among those killed at Gold Spa in Atlanta. Her son, Randy Park, set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for himself and his brother, who are alone now in the United States while the rest of their family is in South Korea.
""She was a single mother who dedicated her whole life to providing for my brother and I,"" Park wrote.
The shootings prompted an outpouring of grief, from the local community in Georgia to the halls of U.S. Congress. Since Tuesday, mourners have piled flower bouquets and signs, lit candles and said prayers outside the spas where the victims were killed.
U.S. lawmakers decried the spike in anti-Asian violence in a congressional hearing on Thursday, where Democratic Representative Grace Meng, who is of Taiwanese descent, testified that the ""community is bleeding.""

On Friday, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris met with Asian American community leaders in Georgia to express condolences and implore Americans to stand together against hate.

The top Chinese and U.S. diplomats, in their first meeting of Joe Biden's presidency on Thursday and Friday, publicly rebuked each other's policies at the start of what Washington called ""tough and direct"" talks in Alaska.
But the Chinese delegation said after the meeting the two sides were ""committed to enhancing communication and cooperation in the field of climate change,"" Xinhua said on Saturday.
They would also hold talks to facilitate the activities of diplomats and consular missions, ""as well as on issues related to media reporters in the spirit of reciprocity and mutual benefit,"" the report said.
The U.S. Embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Sunday.
Last year, as tensions between Beijing and Washington worsened dramatically, the two countries expelled journalists and the United States shut China's consulate in Houston, prompting China to shut the U.S. consulate in Chengdu.
The talks in Anchorage, headed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, had a fiery kickoff, in front of TV cameras, and had appeared to yield no diplomatic breakthroughs. 
But the Chinese delegation said ""both sides share the hope of continuing such type of high-level strategic communication,"" Xinhua reported.
""The two sides also agreed that they ... will maintain dialogue and communication, conduct mutually beneficial cooperation, avoid misunderstanding and misjudgment, as well as conflict and confrontation, so as to promote sound and steady development of China-U.S. relations.""
China and the United States also discussed adjusting travel and visa policies according to the coronavirus pandemic situation, ""and gradually promoting the normalization of personnel exchanges between China and the United States,"" the report said.

BRAZZAVILLE (Reuters) - Polls will open in the Republic of Congo on Sunday, with President Denis Sassou Nguesso widely expected to extend his 36-year rule despite an ongoing economic crisis and accusations of having mismanaged the country's oil revenues. 
With his grip on power as firm as ever, diplomats and analysts alike doubt any of Sassou's six opponents will unseat him, instead suggesting voter turnout as a better barometer of his popularity.
""There will be no surprises in this election,"" one Brazzaville-based diplomat said, requesting anonymity so as to speak candidly. ""People are traumatised. They're not happy, but there's no alternative.""
United Nations and European Union observers were not invited to monitor the election, and the interior ministry refused to allow the Catholic Church's 1,100 observers to take part.
Observers are optimistic that polling will play out peacefully, however, unlike the 2016 presidential election that was marred by sporadic violence. 
An accord signed with opposition fighters in 2017 has spurred hopes for a peaceful aftermath. 
Oil is the lifeblood of Congo's economy, making up three quarters of state revenues. But the country's 5.4 million citizens, 41% of whom the World Bank says live below the global poverty line, have little to show for it.
Extreme poverty has only increased since the last election, according to the World Bank, as oil revenues have sharply declined amid slumping global prices. 
Meanwhile, the country's opaque national oil company and other key private and public sector institutions remain under the control of a group of Sassou's closest associates, transparency campaign Global Witness has said.
""All our money is outside the country,"" said Mathias Dzon, a former finance minister and presidential hopeful on the last day of campaigning on Friday. ""Do you know which accounts? In private accounts.""
The economic crisis, kindled in part by the government's mountain of debt to oil traders like Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) and Trafigura, will pose challenges to whoever inherits the country's highest office.
""The economic situation has been difficult since 2014, but we have faith, unshakeable faith to propel our country on the path to development,"" Sassou said at his final rally in Brazzaville. 

Results are expected to be published within four days of voting. If no candidate secures more than 50% of votes, a second round will take place 15 days later.

Protesters filed through streets closed to traffic by police, waving flags, banging drums, blowing horns and shouting chants to replace the 71-year-old conservative.
The crowd was larger than many previous anti-Netanyahu protests over the past year, with Israeli media reporting it numbered about 20,000.
Though his right-wing Likud is expected to emerge as the biggest party in the March 23 ballot, opinion polls predict no clear winner with a majority in parliament or able to form a government - similar to the three previous elections.
Pressure has mounted in the election run-up on Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption and accused by critics of mismanaging the coronavirus pandemic.
Netanyahu is hoping the success of his government’s rapid COVID-19 vaccination programme, which has allowed much of the economy to open after three lockdowns, along with a series of normalization agreements with Arab countries, will give him the boost needed to secure a majority in parliament.

Netanyahu faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, all of which he denies.

Protesters from all over Germany converged on the central city of Kassel for the march, which was organised by the ""Querdenker"" - ""Lateral Thinkers"" - online conspiracy movement.
""Bottles were thrown and there were attempts to break through barriers,"" police said on Twitter. 
Police said protesters disobeyed instructions they gave to help ensure people's safety, including by refusing to wear face masks and observe social distancing guidelines.

With Germany in its fourth month of lockdown and vaccination efforts lagging compared to Britain and the United States, many people, from shopkeepers to would-be holidaymakers, are increasingly restive at the lack of a clear path to a return to normal life.

National and regional leaders are due to consult on Monday over the next steps in the national lockdown. But with case numbers rising sharply thanks to the spread of more infectious variants, many politicians are saying it is too early to ease restrictions.

The rejected motion included the willingness to act against climate risks and to make highly polluting Canadian businesses take more responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole had urged party members on Friday to rally around an ambitious climate agenda to avoid a defeat at the hands of Liberals. He asked members to be open to new ideas if they were serious about toppling Liberals in the next election, even if that goes against party's conventional thinking and said he doesn't want Conservative candidates to be branded as ""climate change deniers.""
Yet, the Conservative delegates rejected the policy shift by 54% to 46%.
Climate change has been a polarizing issue in the last election campaign. While Trudeau stresses that the environment is a priority, Canada has failed to meet any of its climate pledges amid resistance from politicians who say the targets threaten the oil industry's future.

Canada is the world's fourth-largest oil producer and one of the highest emitters of green house gases on a per capita basis and Prime Minister Trudeau's Liberal Party supporters rank it among their top concerns.

Prosecutors said on Friday members of the alleged spying ring, who included former and current military intelligence officers, had passed classified information about Bulgaria, NATO and the EU to an official at the Russian embassy in Sofia.
During the last 18 months, Bulgaria has expelled six Russian diplomats, including a military attache, over suspected spying - straining historically close diplomatic ties between the NATO and EU member and Moscow.
""Once again it could be necessary to declare Russian diplomats as unwanted. And with regards the operation yesterday, I again address their superiors to stop spying in Bulgaria,"" Borissov said during a trip to the northeastern city of Silistra.
""Friendship is friendship, we have always demonstrated it,"" he added.
Bulgaria was one of the closest allies of the Soviet Union during the Communist era. It maintains close cultural, historical and economic ties with Russia, which remains the country's main energy partner.
The Russian embassy in Sofia said on Friday that speculation about its alleged involvement should stop until a court rules, calling the case an attempt to ""once again demonise"" Russia.
The United States, Britain and neighbouring North Macedonia said they stand with Bulgaria against ""malign activities"" on its territory. 

""We fully support Bulgaria's efforts in disrupting an alleged spy ring and taking steps to tackle Russia's hostile actions in its territory,"" British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter on Saturday.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya has offered free COVID-19 vaccines to all diplomats based there, including thousands of United Nations staff, even though it has not completed inoculating its own health workers, other frontline staff or elderly, drawing criticism from local medics.
The offer was made in a March 18 letter sent by the Ministry of Foreign affairs to diplomatic missions and seen by Reuters. Macharia Kamau, the foreign ministry's principal secretary, said the shots being offered had been supplied via the World Health Organization (WHO) co-led COVAX vaccine access scheme.
Kenya, where nearly 2,000 people have died of COVID-19, is battling a third wave and the health ministry reported 28 deaths on Friday, the highest daily toll since the pandemic began. 
""We need to protect everyone resident in Kenya. It just made sense not to reach out only to Kenyans but also to the international community here,"" Kamau said 
Kamau said Kenyans in priority categories were still being vaccinated but the decision was in keeping with Kenya's responsibilities as home to a large diplomatic community. 
He estimated that 25,000 to 30,000 diplomats, U.N. staff and family members live in Nairobi. ""We are the only United Nations capital headquarters in the global South. Once you have this kind of honour, it comes with a certain responsibility.""
Nairobi hosts the U.N. headquarters in Africa. The U.N. Office at Nairobi (UNON) is one of four major sites worldwide, where many U.N. agencies such as the children's agency UNICEF and others have large presences.
Just over 28,000 health workers, teachers and security personnel had received their first shots, the Ministry of Health said in a March 19 post on Twitter. It said in early March that it would set aside 400,000 vaccines for health staff and other essential workers.
""I think the government should focus on getting the priority population vaccinated and achieving vaccine acceptancy with them before opening up to diplomats,"" said Elizabeth Gitau, a Kenyan physician and the chief executive officer of the Kenya Medical Association (KMA). 
The health ministry referred questions to the foreign ministry. Two Nairobi-based diplomats who declined to be identified confirmed their embassies had received the offer.
""Kenyans must be given priority,"" said Chibanzi Mwachonda, head of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union.
The government note said vaccinations would begin on March 23 and only accredited diplomats and their families were eligible.
Kenya has so far only received two batches of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccines - just over 1 million via COVAX and a 100,000 shot donation from the Indian government.
COVAX was set up to ensure vaccines were available to high risk and vulnerable people, as well as frontline health workers, in countries unable to buy shots on the highly competitive international market.
The WHO referred Reuters to the UNON and the Kenyan government when asked for comment. 
Newton Kanhem, spokesman for UNON, confirmed it had received the offer and would be taking the government up on it. He said UNON had approximately 20,000 staff and dependents, but many were children and therefore not eligible.

“Why does the Kenyan government prioritize expats - who have money and can get the vaccines through their own channels - over its own population, especially the poor?,” said one of diplomats whose embassy had received the jabs offer.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Mediterranean countries on the frontline of Europe's migration crisis called for more solidarity from EU governments on Saturday and said a proposed overhaul of migration rules did not go far enough.
The EU has fought bitterly since 2015, when over 1 million people, most of them Syrian, Iraqi or Afghan refugees, arrived on its shores, the majority through Greece.
A new pact to tackle the issue was put forward by the European Commission last September but a final deal has yet to be reached. 
""In its current format, the pact does not provide sufficient reassurances to the frontline member states,"" the interior and migration ministers of Greece, Italy, Spain, Cyprus and Malta said in a joint statement after a summit of the so-called MED5 in Athens.
Arrivals have dropped significantly to about 95,000 people last year, according to United Nations data, most to Italy, Spain and Greece.
The ministers called for more cooperation with origin or transit countries, a centrally-managed European returns mechanism, and relocation of asylum seekers among all member states.
""We cannot have the five Mediterranean member states taking all of the pressure from the rest of the European Union,"" Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi told Reuters.
""We need the solidarity to be mandatory.""
The EU's top migration official, Margaritis Schinas, said Mediterranean countries were ""forced, by geography, to carry a disproportionately large burden of the refugee crisis"".
""Mandatory solidarity"" is the most sensitive part of the pact, obliging each country to host some migrants by either accepting migrants, sponsoring their return to countries of origin or offering material assistance on the ground to arrival countries.
The right-wing nationalist governments of Poland and Hungary oppose the plan, even though under the Commission proposal the EU would pay a country 10,000 euros per adult taken in. 
Italian Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese said ""a lot still needs to be done."" 

""We'll be asking in Europe for compulsory relocation, even if it's in limited numbers. We've been absolutely in agreement on this,"" she told Reuters.

Salvini's decision, made when he was interior minister, left the migrants stranded at sea until prosecutors ordered the seizure of the ship and the evacuation of the people on board. 
Salvini defended his action on Saturday and said he was not worried about the prosecutor's application which is part of a long-running legal process - Italy's Senate authorised the court to pursue the kidnapping investigation last year.
""I am proud to have worked to protect my country, respecting the law, waking up Europe and saving lives. If this should cause me problems and suffering, I'll gladly take it on,"" Salvini wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
During his 14 months as interior minister, Salvini stopped several boats from docking in Italy in an effort to halt migrant flows. He regularly accused migrant rescue charities of effectively encouraging people smuggling. 
He could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty at the end of a tortuous, three-stage judicial process. A definitive conviction could bar him from government office.
The prosecutor asked for the indictment in a preliminary hearing in the Sicilian capital of Palermo. The final decision on whether to proceed still rests with a senior judge.
Open Arms, the charity which operated the migrant rescue ship at the heart of the case, said it supported the prosecutor's application.

""Violating the rights of vulnerable people is a crime in any democratic country,"" it wrote on Twitter.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish Kurds voiced anger on Saturday over a court attempt to ban a pro-Kurdish political party, turning their Newroz spring festival celebrations across the country into a show of defiance.
In the culmination of a years-long crackdown, a prosecutor filed a case this week to close the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) over alleged links to Kurdish militants. The HDP, parliament's third-largest party, denies such ties and called the move a ""political coup"".
""They know closing the HDP will not be a solution. You can close a party but you can't close people's minds,"" Abbas Mendi, 45, said at a Newroz celebration in Istanbul, where thousands gathered at a rally amid tight police security.
The crowd waved the brightly coloured flags of the HDP and other left-wing parties, played Kurdish music and danced after listening to speeches by HDP officials. It won 11.7% support, or nearly 6 million votes, in a 2018 general election. 
""They closed 7-8 parties like this before and they came back stronger,"" said Mendi, a 45-year-old man from Sirnak in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast, describing Newroz as a ""festival of peace, resistance and resurrection"".
Celebrating Newroz, the Persian New Year, has long been a mark of pride for Kurds, who make up some 20% of Turkey's 84 million people and live mainly in the southeast. Istanbul also has a large Kurdish population.
Ridvan Aktas, 30, said he thought no ethnic group in the world had suffered as much oppression as the Kurds, and accused President Tayyip Erdogan's government of targeting anyone who opposed it. The government says it treats all citizens equally. 
""If you are near to them you are good, but if you stand apart from them you are a terrorist, a traitor. The HDP is our honour and our guide. There is no way they can close it,"" said Aktas, who works in the fishing industry.
Turkey has a long history of shutting down political parties that it regards as a threat and has in the past banned a series of pro-Kurdish parties.
Erdogan's government, like the prosecutor, accuses the HDP of close ties to Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants, which is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union. The HDP has repeatedly denied any such links.
The PKK launched an insurgency against the state in 1984 and more than 40,000 people have been killed in the fighting. Some Kurds say the current situation is reminiscent of the height of the conflict in the 1990s.
""We are experiencing how it was in the 90s now. It is getting increasingly worse. They force our deputies out of parliament. They think they have the right, but we are seeking our rights,"" said Semsiyan Aslanhan, a 43-year-old woman.
The prosecutor's case to close down the HDP kicked off a tumultuous week in Turkey. Early on Saturday, Erdogan pulled the country from an international accord designed to protect women, and sacked the central bank governor.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai police used water cannon and charged toward protesters who had gathered near the King's Palace in Bangkok on Saturday to call for the release of protest leaders and demand reform of the monarchy.
Hundreds of police in riot gear and shields advanced on different fronts against protesters to push people away from the Grand Palace. In some places they faced off with protesters who threw firecrackers.
More than 1,000 protesters had gathered near the palace in Bangkok in an area known as Sanam Luang, or Royal Field.
""We will arrest anyone on the streets,"" police said over loudspeakers as multiple lines of police advanced, pushing people back.
Police used shields, batons, rubber bullets and tear gas and detained five protesters, police deputy spokesman Kissana Pattanacharoen told reporters.
""We repeatedly issued warnings before escalating our response,"" he said, adding that protesters used metal bars and threw stones and marbles.
The demonstrations comes after parliament this week failed to pass a bill to rewrite the military-backed constitution, one of the protesters' main demands.
A mass trial for protest leaders began this week against activists who were accused of sedition and insulting the monarchy.
“We’re demanding real democracy and not a government that says it is elected but comes from the army,” said a man who gave his name only as Kung, 60. “The world has changed and we want the same kind of monarchy as in Western countries.”
A portrait of the king near the protest area was defaced. 
Thailand's youth protest movement has posed the biggest challenge so far to Prime Minster Prayuth Chan-ocha. Protesters say he engineered a process that would preserve the political status quo and keep him in power after a 2019 election. Prayuth has rejected that.
Protesters also demanded reform of the monarchy, breaking a traditional taboo, saying the constitution drafted by the military after the 2014 coup gives the king too much power.

The Royal Palace has declined to directly comment on the protests, but Prayuth and government officials have said that criticism of the king is unlawful and inappropriate.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark said on Saturday that one person had died and another fell seriously ill with blood clots and cerebral haemorrhage after receiving the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccination.
The two, both hospital staff members, had both received the AstraZeneca vaccine less than 14 days before getting ill, the authority that runs public hospitals in Copenhagen said.
The Danish Medicines Agency confirmed it had received two ""serious reports"", without giving further details. There were no details of when the hospital staff got ill.
Denmark, which halted using the AstraZeneca vaccine on March 11, was among more than a dozen countries that temporarily paused use of the vaccine after a small number of reports of cases of rare brain blood clots sent scientists and governments scrambling to determine any link.
Some countries including Germany and France this week reversed their decision to suspend use of the vaccine following an investigation into the reports of blood clots by the European Union's drug watchdog, which said on Thursday it is still convinced the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.
Denmark - along with Sweden and Norway - said on Friday they needed more time to decide whether to use the vaccine.
""We prioritize reports of suspected serious side effects such as these and examine them thoroughly to assess whether there is a possible link to the vaccine,"" Tanja Erichsen, acting director of Pharmacovigilance at the Danish Medicines Agency, said in a tweet on Saturday.
""We are in the process of dealing with the two specific cases.""
European Medicines Agency (EMA) director Emer Cooke said on Thursday the watchdog could not definitively rule out a link between blood clot incidents and the vaccine in its investigation. 
But she said the ""clear"" conclusion of the review was that the benefits in protecting people from the risk of death or hospitalisation outweighs the possible risks. The issue deserves further analysis, the EMA said.
The EMA's review covering 20 million people in the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA), which links 30 European countries, included seven cases of blood clots in multiple blood vessels and 18 cases of a rare condition that is difficult to treat called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).
AstraZeneca, which developed the shot with Oxford University, has said a review covering more than 17 million people who had received its shots in the EU and Britain had found no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.
The company on Saturday declined to comment on the new cases in Denmark, but referred to a statement published on Thursday, in which its chief medical officer, Ann Taylor, said:

""Vaccine safety is paramount and we welcome the regulators' decisions which affirm the overwhelming benefit of our vaccine in stopping the pandemic. We trust that, after the regulators' careful decisions, vaccinations can once again resume across Europe.""

LAHORE (Reuters) - Two men were sentenced to death on Saturday for gang-raping a woman on the side of a highway in Pakistan last year, an attack that triggered nationwide protests and calls for tougher laws.
The men, Abid Malhi and Shafqat Hussain, were convicted of gang rape, kidnapping, robbery and terrorism offences, according to a written order released by the judge in the eastern city of Lahore.
The woman was raped at the side of a highway in the eastern province of Punjab after her car ran out of fuel while she was driving her two children in September.
Protesters took to the streets saying Pakistan needed to bring in legal reforms and do more to protect women and children after a series of high-profile cases.
Fewer than 3% of sexual assault or rape cases result in a conviction in Pakistan, according to the Karachi-based group War Against Rape.
In December, Pakistan introduced a new rape law, creating create special courts in a bid to speed up prosecutions and setting up a national sex offender registry.
The two condemned men were also sentenced to life imprisonment, fined and had property confiscated, Rauf Wattoo, a public prosecutor involved in the case, told Reuters.
""The survivor had identified the convicts twice during the identification parade in jail and while recording her statement in front of the judge,"" another prosecutor, Waqar Bhatti, said.

Rights campaigners have called for an end to a culture that they say regularly blames victims of sexual assault. After the rape in September, one senior police official publicly questioned why the woman had been driving alone at night with her children.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin discussed India's planned purchase of Russia's S400 air defence system at a meeting with his Indian counterpart on Saturday, reiterating U.S. allies should steer clear of Russian equipment to avoid sanctions. 
""We certainly urge all our allies, our partners to move away from Russian equipment ... and really avoid any kind of acquisitions that would trigger sanctions on our behalf,"" Austin told reporters in New Delhi. 
No S400 systems have been delivered to India and so the possibility of sanctions was not discussed, he said. 
The United States last year imposed sanctions on Turkey for buying the S400 system.
India made an initial payment of $800 million in 2019 towards the Russian purchase and the first set of missile batteries are expected later this year. 
Ahead of Austin's trip, Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, asked him to raise democracy and human rights concerns in his talks with the Indian government, as well reaffirm the Biden administration's opposition to India's planned purchase of the Russian systems.
Austin is making the first visit by a top member of U.S. President Joe Biden's administration to India as part of efforts to forge an alliance of countries seeking to push back against China's assertiveness in the region.
The leaders of the United States, India, Australia and Japan - countries together known as the Quad - held a first summit last week pledging to work together for a free and open Indo-Pacific and to cooperate on maritime and cyber security in the face of challenges from China.
""India, in particular, is an increasingly important partner among today's rapidly shifting international dynamics,"" Austin said after meeting Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, during which they discussed strengthening security ties.
""We discussed opportunities to elevate the U.S.-India major defence partnership ... and we'll do that through regional security cooperation and military to military interactions and defence trade,"" Austin added.
The United States has emerged as one of India's biggest arms sellers, and the two sides are also discussing India's plan to buy armed drones from the United States as well as a large order for over 150 combat jets for the air force and the navy to help narrow the gap with China, Reuters reported on Friday.
U.S. firms Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) are front runners for the multibillion-dollar combat jet deals. 
Austin met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his arrival in New Delhi on Friday. He leaves on Sunday.

India drew closer to the United States last year following a deadly border clash with China. Washington has helped New Delhi, leasing surveillance drones and supplying cold-weather gear for Indian troops.

Myanmar's military is facing international condemnation over a Feb. 1 coup and bloody crackdowns on protests against military rule in which nearly 250 people have been killed. 
Thailand has voiced concern over the bloodshed. 
Direct Thai assistance to the Myanmar military would likely draw criticism from supporters of the ousted government that was led by Aung San Suu Kyi. The Nobel peace laureate has been detained in Myanmar since the coup.
Thai media reported that the Thai army had supplied 700 sacks of rice to Myanmar army units on Myanmar's eastern border, citing an unidentified security official as saying it was on the orders of the Thai government.
""The Thai army is not supplying the Myanmar army and there has been no contact from the Myanmar army requesting help or demanding any assistance from us because they have their own honour,” Major General Amnat Srimak, commander of the Naresuan Force, said in a statement.
""If there is anything, I think there is regular commerce at normal border crossings,"" Amnat said. ""We are not blocking this if the conduct is not against the law and follows customs procedures.”
A Thai government spokesman did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Myanmar’s army did not answer calls seeking comment.
Thai media said the Myanmar army units being supplied near the border had been cut off by forces of the Karen National Union (KNU), an ethnic minority insurgent group that agreed to a ceasefire with the Myanmar government in 2012.
A KNU spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The KNU has thrown its support behind Myanmar's democracy movement and condemned the military's coup and crackdown.
The Myanmar junta has defended its coup saying a Nov. 8 election won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy was fraudulent and its claims were ignored by the electoral commission. It has promised a new election but has not set a date.
Thai media showed pictures of what appeared to be bags of rice being loaded into trucks at the border. Pictures seen by Reuters showed men, some in camouflage uniform, crossing into Thailand and having their temperatures checked.
Border trade between Thailand and Myanmar has been severely restricted since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Residents told a Reuters reporter the crossing shown in the pictures was not a normal trade route.

TOKYO (Reuters) - An earthquake struck off the coast of northeastern Japan on Saturday, shaking buildings and generating a tsunami of 1 metre in the same area devastated a decade ago by a quake and tsunami. 
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.2, hit off the coast of Miyagi Prefecture at 6:26 p.m. (0926 GMT) at a depth of 60 km (40 miles), the Japan Meteorological Agency said. 
While there were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries, the quake was strong enough to shake buildings in Tokyo, some 400 km (250 miles) away. 
An official for the meteorological agency told reporters it was an aftershock of the deadly 2011 quake. The 2011 disaster, one of the strongest earthquakes on record, is still generating aftershocks a decade later, experts have said. A magnitude 7.3 quake last month had also been deemed to be an aftershock.
About an hour after Saturday's quake, all tsunami alerts were lifted, broadcaster NHK said, after warning the public not to go near the shore.
""It was a really bad, long shaking from side-to-side. It was even longer than the quake last month, but at least the building here is all right,"" Shizue Onodera told NHK from the shop where she works in the city of Ishinomaki.
""Lots of bottles smashed on the floor,"" she said. ""The electricity is on.""
Tokyo Electric Power said it had found no irregularities at its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant - wrecked by the massive March 2011 quake that caused nuclear meltdowns and mass evacuations. A spokesman said there were also no irregularities at its nearby Daini facility.
There were no irregularities at Tohoku Electric Power Co's Onagawa nuclear plant, the nuclear regulator said in an email.
Service on the Tohoku shinkansen bullet train was halted, NHK said.
About 200 households in Kurihara city, Miyagi Prefecture, lost power because of the quake, the trade and industry ministry said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Holidays abroad are ""extremely unlikely"" for most Britons this summer due to the risk of importing new variants of COVID-19, a scientist who advises the government said on Saturday, leaving airlines and travel companies bracing for a second lost peak season. 
Britain has banned travel for most people during the current lockdown and has said overseas holidays will not be allowed until May 17 at the earliest. 
But Mike Tildesley, a scientist on a government advisory body, said the risk of importing vaccine-resistant variants back into the UK would likely scupper the nation's annual getaway. 
""I think international travel this summer is, for the average holidaymaker, sadly I think, extremely unlikely,"" Tildesley, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick, told BBC Radio on Saturday. 
His warning is a further setback for the travel industry's recovery prospects during the peak vacation season.
Airlines and holiday companies such as British Airways (part of International Consolidated Airlines (OTC:ICAGY)), easyJet (LON:EZJ) and TUI are desperate for travel to resume after a year of COVID-19 restrictions which has left them struggling financially. 
Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group which reports into the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), said travel overseas and the variants that could be imported could undermine Britain's vaccine programme. 
""I think we are running a real risk if we do start to have lots of people going overseas in July, for instance, and August, because of the potential for bringing more of these new variants back into the country,"" Tildesley said. 

Britain has already given half of its adult population a first vaccination, putting it far ahead of the rest of Europe, but existing vaccines are thought to be not as effective against some variants now surging in parts of Europe.

Meanwhile in Switzerland, a customer who refused to wear a mask has been banned for five years from the Migros supermarket chain.
Coronavirus fatigue is rising in both countries with protests taking place against restrictions which have seen shops and restaurants closed, and mandatory mask wearing introduced. 
One teacher in each of the districts of Freistadt, Voecklabruck and in the city of Wels in upper Austria were dismissed after talks with the authorities failed to resolve the situation, the paper said.
""There were many efforts to convince him to comply with the applicable hygiene and preventive measures - but they were all in vain,"" the education directorate told the newspaper about the Freistadt teacher.
Three other teachers in Freistadt, Braunau and Steyr, were persuaded the wear the masks, and have kept their jobs, the newspaper said.
Since January 25, Austria has tightened its rules to require FFP2 masks - which filter particles - be worn where previously cotton masks were suitable. 
In Switzerland, where mask wearing is compulsory indoors, a self-proclaimed 'coronavirus rebel' tried to enter a supermarket in Lucerne without wearing a mask. 
He repeatedly refused to wear a mask, and was eventually arrested by the police. The man, who has not been named, has also been banned from Migros-owned shops like SportXX and Micasa furniture stores.
""If a customer shows himself unreasonable, becomes abusive, threatens and disrupts operations, Migros Lucerne reserves the right to issue a ban,"" a spokesperson told Swiss newspaper 20 Minutes.

""This project is of great importance for the security of supply of the European gas market, it is therefore Europe's responsibility to decide,"" Seele told Austrian newspaper Wiener Zeitung. 
""We have had a deep transatlantic friendship with the USA for decades. And friends shouldn't threaten each other,"" he said in an interview published on Saturday.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week the State Department was tracking efforts to complete the natural gas pipeline and evaluating information on entities that appear to be involved.
Any company involved should immediately abandon work or risk U.S. sanctions, Blinken said.
Nearly 20 companies, mostly insurance firms, recently quit the project after Washington warned that they could be sanctioned.
OMV's Seele said he hoped the project - which is being led by Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) - would be completed. 
The Austrian company is one of Gazprom's partners in the 9.5 billion euro project.
Others include Germany’s Uniper, BASF’s Wintershall Dea, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and France's Engie.
The project pits Germany against central and eastern European nations which argue the project to double Russia's gas export capacity across the Baltic Sea increases Europe's dependence on Russian gas and could be used as a political tool by Moscow.
Lithuania's foreign affairs minister said last month the project should be paused until Russia’s parliamentary elections in September to pressure Moscow for democratic reforms and as a compromise between its European supporters and critics. 
""In Europe we have clear rules of the game that are based on consensus. The concerns of smaller member states must therefore be taken into account,"" Seele told the newspaper.

""As a connecting country for Nord Stream 2, Germany has a clear position. Political dialogue has to be conducted and persuasion has to be done.""

U.S. hate crime laws vary widely by state, and prosecutors do not always use them. But experts say such laws - which establish tougher penalties for crimes that are motivated by racial, gender or other types of hatred - offer important protections.
""Having a hate-crime law tells victims of hate crimes that 'you matter and we'll take it seriously if somebody hurts you,'"" said Northeastern University criminology professor Jack McDevitt. 
Authorities in Georgia have yet to determine what drove 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long to kill six Asian-American women and two others on Tuesday. Long, a white man, told investigators that a sex addiction led him to violence, but lawmakers and anti-racism advocates have said they believe the killings were at least in part motivated by anti-Asian sentiments.
Meeting with Asian-American leaders in Georgia on Friday, President Joe Biden called on Congress to pass legislation that would bolster the federal government's response to hate crimes, and improve state and local reporting.
Only three U.S. states - South Carolina, Arkansas and Wyoming - have no hate crime laws. A key backer of a pending bill in Arkansas said the Georgia shooting raised the prospects of getting the measures passed.
It ""makes no sense morally to not send that message that you can't target people,"" said Jim Hendren, a Republican-turned-independent state senator in Arkansas who hopes to get hate crime legislation approved there next month.
In South Carolina, legislation named after the pastor of a church where a white man killed nine Black churchgoers in 2015 has drawn support from companies that have been vocal about the competitive disadvantage without such a law.
""No one wants to be the last state standing without a hate crime law,"" said Swati Patel, interim CEO of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce. 
That last state might be Wyoming, where a hate crime bill stalled in the legislature last week. State Representative Pat Sweeney, a Republican, says he hopes it will pass next year. ""We've got to do it in a manner that will appease the right wingers and I think we can get there,"" he said. ""I would have loved to see us move things -- the shootings in Georgia were just awful.""
UNEVENLY APPLIED
Georgia passed its hate crime bill in June 2020, after the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed Black man, sparked widespread outrage.
The state laws are unevenly applied and offer varying protections, however. California's hate crime laws cover crimes motivated by a victim's gender identity, age, sexual orientation and political affiliation. Alabama's laws do not cover any of those categories.
Some experts say authorities too often choose not to apply them because it can be more difficult to establish a criminal's motive than to simply prosecute them for the crime itself.
In 2019, 86% of law enforcement agencies either affirmatively reported no hate crimes, or did not report any such data to the FBI at all, according to Scott McCoy, interim deputy legal director for the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Some people think the laws need to be expanded to protect other victims, such as homeless people. 
""We're seeing more types of people getting attacked, and some of them are not covered by hate crime laws,"" said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.
A report by the center found that hate crimes against Asian Americans in 16 major U.S. cities rose by 149% from 2019 to 2020, a period when overall hate crimes dropped 7%.
Seizing an opening, some North Carolina state senators are preparing to resubmit the ""Hate Crimes Prevention Act"" for a third time after attempts fizzled in 2018 and 2019.
The bill would expand the scope of hate crimes to include ethnicity, gender identity and sexual orientation, while also funding the creation of a hate crimes database and training for law enforcement.
State Senator Jay Chaudhuri, a Democratic sponsor of the bill, said he hoped the increased focus on anti-Asian American hate incidents would mobilize advocacy groups.

""The reintroduction of this bill has garnered more attention than ever before,"" he said.

The May 22 election in the West Bank and Gaza is part of a broader push for reconciliation between President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah faction and rival Islamist group Hamas. This is seen as vital to building broader support for any future statehood talks with Israel, frozen since 2014.
The last time a parliamentary ballot was held in 2006, Hamas emerged as the surprise victor. A power struggle ensued, and in 2007, after weeks of fighting that left dozens dead, the Islamist group seized control of Gaza from forces loyal to Abbas. Abbas' authority has limited control over the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Some 93% of the 2.8 million eligible voters in the West Bank and Gaza have registered for the polling. The total population in the Palestinian territories is 5.2 million. 
Israel has yet to respond to a Palestinian request to allow balloting to take place in East Jerusalem, Palestinian officials said.
Israel captured the eastern part of Jerusalem in a 1967 war and later annexed it in a move that has not won international recognition. It did allow voting there in 2006.
Unlike in the 1996 and 2006 elections, Palestinians will not be voting for individual candidates, rather for parties or lists that contain between 16 and 132 candidates.

Farid Taamallah, a spokesman of the Palestinian Central Election Commission, said on Saturday that officials had so far registered two electoral lists. Registration ends on March 31.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's east coast was smashed by heavy rains on Saturday, sparking dangerous flash flooding that forced the evacuation of multiple regions as the fast-moving waters unmoored houses, engulfed roads, stranded towns and cut power lines.
In Sydney, the country's biggest city, authorities pleaded for people to stay at home as a major dam overflowed and a mini-tornado tore through a western suburb.
Most of the coast of New South Wales (NSW) state, which is home to about a third of Australia's 25 million people, has already seen March rainfall records broken and authorities warned the downpour was likely to continue for several days.
""I hate to say this again to all our citizens of the state, but it's not going to be an easy week for us,"" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told a televised briefing. ""The rain may not stop till Thursday or Friday.""
Officials had issued nine evacuation orders for about 15 areas by Saturday afternoon.
Television footage showed increasing damage across the state, with water engulfing houses up to the windows, people kayaking through the streets, and damaged roads. One video showed an entire house being swept away. Local media reported that the house owners had managed to evacuate.
Warragamba Dam, a major water supply for Sydney, began overflowing on Saturday afternoon. Officials warned that the overflow would quickly add to swollen rivers, leading to flash flooding.
A mini-tornado ripped through a suburb in the west of the city, causing damage to more than 30 homes, knocking down trees and cutting power, emergency services said. 
People were urged to stay at home and avoid any non-essential trips, with officials lambasting those who had needed help after venturing out into the stormy weather.
Emergency crews responded to about 4,000 calls for help over the past two days, including 500 direct flood rescues, a level NSW Emergency Services Minister David Elliott said was ""just completely unacceptable.""
""The message is clear: do not walk through or drive through floodwaters, do not drive over water that is covering a road,"" Elliott said.
Social and sporting events were called off across the state, including football games and one of Australian turf’s marquee horse races, the A$3.5 million ($2.7 million) Golden Slipper. 
The federal government said the extreme weather was affecting its COVID-19 vaccine delivery in Sydney and throughout state, but said delays should last only a few days.

Australia plans to deliver the first vaccine doses to almost six million people over the next few weeks.

Under England's coronavirus rules, it is unlawful for groups to gather for protests and police warned people on Saturday not to head to central London for planned demonstrations, including by anti-lockdown campaigners.
Police were criticised for using heavy-handed tactics on March 13 to break up an outdoor vigil for 33-year-old Sarah Everard. A police officer has been charged with her kidnap and murder.
Further protests followed, fuelled by anger over government plans to tighten the law on demonstrations. 
The group of lawmakers, including Conservative Member of Parliament Steve Baker, and Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said that protest should not be a criminal offence. 
""We call on you to expressly exempt protests from restrictions on gatherings,"" they said in the letter, which was organised by campaign groups Liberty and Big Brother Watch. 
The interior ministry, known as the Home Office, said in response that the COVID-19 stay at home order remains in place until March 29, and once it ends protests can resume subject to agreed social-distancing measures. 
""While we are still in a pandemic we continue to urge people to avoid mass gatherings, in line with wider coronavirus restrictions,"" a spokeswoman said.
Police said that a significant operation will be in place in London to engage with people breaching COVID-19 regulations, adding that any protesters will be encouraged to return home or could face fines or arrest.

249,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>",Polish doctors torn over mental health as grounds to bypass near-total abortion ban,"By Joanna Plucinska and Kuba Stezycki
WARSAW (Reuters) - When Polish doctors told Paulina, 29, that her unborn child had no kidneys and would die upon birth, she knew she couldn't go through with the pregnancy. 
""Everyone says that the reward after the pain of birth is holding your child in your hands,"" said Paulina, a retail manager from Gdynia, who asked Reuters to withhold her surname. 
""I would have nothing. I would give birth to a dead child, and that pain would be a thousand times worse.""
Until two months ago, women like Paulina still stood a chance of being allowed an abortion in Poland. However, in a ruling that came into effect in January, the constitutional court decided that terminating pregnancies due to foetal abnormalities was no longer legal, effectively imposing a near-total ban on abortions.
Polish law now considers only incest, rape or a threat to a mother's life and health as valid grounds to terminate a pregnancy.
Poland's ruling nationalists supported the move but the country was rocked by weeks of nationwide protests following the Oct. 22 ruling, which quickly morphed into an outpouring of anger against the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government and the powerful Catholic Church.
Paulina's only option, therefore, was to find a doctor willing to attest that giving birth was a threat to her health. 
Two weeks after Paulina learned of her baby's condition, abortion rights activists helped her to find a psychiatrist prepared to state that she needed to have an abortion on mental health grounds, and her abortion went ahead. 
This makes her one of perhaps only around a dozen women who has managed to get an abortion on such grounds since the ruling came into effect, abortion support groups told Reuters. 
Several doctors and lawyers Reuters spoke to maintain that abortions on mental health grounds are in keeping with the law, but government officials and conservative groups call this into question.
Poland's Ministry of Health told Reuters in an emailed statement that a qualified medical specialist in the appropriate field should determine if a pregnancy threatens the life or health of the mother, depending on the woman's illness.
It did not say if it considered a threat to mental health as sufficient grounds for an abortion. 
""I've seen opinions like, 'I'm anxious and I don't want to give birth',"" Michal Wojcik, a government minister and member of the socially conservative United Poland grouping allied with the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, told Reuters. 
""I don't think we should count such instances, which are there to simply go around the rules."" 
A lawyer for Ordo Iuris, a campaign group that champions ultra-conservative and religious causes, also told Reuters that, in her opinion, giving a recommendation on the basis of mental health was illegal.
ABORTION ACCESS SHRINKING
Some women have chosen to get abortions abroad, despite the coronavirus pandemic and the associated travel restrictions. Paulina was initially told she should go to the Netherlands, a trip she was afraid to do alone.
According to abortion support groups, several women are waiting to find a doctor who is willing to help them, of which there are still very few. This is partly out of fear: Under Polish law, women who undergo an illegal abortion face no penalty, while a doctor can be jailed for up to three years. 
In addition, many doctors in Poland, especially in the more conservative southeast, were already exercising their legal right to refuse on religious grounds to terminate pregnancies before the ruling went into force. More are expected to do so now. 
Of the four doctors who agreed to support Paulina's case for an abortion, only one, Aleksandra Krasowska, a Warsaw-based psychiatrist, was willing to be named by Reuters, and confirmed that she had referred Paulina for the termination due to her deteriorating mental health. The other three - a psychiatrist, doctor and a gynecologist - spoke to Reuters anonymously.
""It's important that this isn't a one-person decision ... Then it's easier for all of us, to handle this fear of the prosecutor and of the three years in jail,"" one of the psychiatrists involved told Reuters.
Maciej Socha, a Gdansk-based gynecologist, is one of few doctors willing to argue publicly that a threat to a woman's mental health should be accepted as a grounds for abortion. 
""If a patient has a brain tumour and continuing the pregnancy threatens her life and health, we can end the pregnancy. If a patient has psychiatric reasons ..., then in my opinion, this is enough to end such a pregnancy,"" Socha said.

Paulina believes the doctors who helped her terminate her pregnancy saved her life. ""These people are heroes. That they aren't afraid of the consequences from this sick country that they live in,"" she said.

A young man was shot and killed in one of the most turbulent neighbourhoods of the main city of Yangon, a resident and media reported, taking the death toll since the Feb. 1 coup to 238, according to a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group.
The bloodshed has not quelled public abhorrence for the return of military rule and anger over the ouster of the elected government and the detention of its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.
But some activists say they have had to adapt tactics.
""We protest where there are no police or military, then when we hear they're coming, we disperse quickly,"" campaigner Kyaw Min Htike told Reuters from Dawei in the south before he and others staged a brief rally outside the town centre.
""I don't want to lose a single one of my comrades but we'll protest any way we can until our revolution prevails.""
Some groups gather at night with candles and placards, then melt away after taking photographs. People also stage ""unmanned"" protests, with rows of placards with messages like ""We will never stop until we get democracy"" set up on a street.
On Saturday, dozens of demonstrators gathered in the second city of Mandalay. Several were injured when a vehicle drove into them and when police fired rubber bullets, a city news portal reported. It was not clear why the vehicle hit the protesters.
There were small protests in other towns, including Kyaukme and Hsipaw in the northeast, Kawlin in the north, Hpa-an and Myawaddy in the east, Labutta in the Irrawaddy river delta, Myeik in the south and the central town of Yay Oo, according to news portals and social media images.
Hundreds marched in the town of Monywa and burned a copy of the 2008 constitution, which was drafted under military supervision and limits the powers of elected civilians, the Irrawaddy news portal reported.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday condemned what he called the military's continuing brutal violence. A ""firm, unified international response"" was urgently needed, his spokesman quoted him as saying.
U.N. rapporteur Tom Andrews called for sanctions in response to the generals' ""ruthless"" attacks on people. ""The world must respond by cutting their access to money and weapons. Now,"" he wrote on Twitter.
The U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation condemning the coup, and lawmakers decried the increasingly harsh tactics against the demonstrators.
Authorities have tightened restrictions on internet services, making information increasingly difficult to verify, and have clamped down on private media.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has banned all pages linked to the military over guidelines on inciting violence. On Saturday, Twitter said it had suspended the information ministry's page under the company's ""platform manipulation and spam policy"".
The ministry has been posting news daily.
ASIAN ANGER
Western countries have repeatedly condemned the coup and the violence. Asian neighbours, who have for years abided by a code of not criticising each other's problems, have also begun speaking out.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, in some of the strongest comments yet by a regional leader, said he would ask Brunei, the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to call an urgent meeting.
""Indonesia urges that the use of violence in Myanmar be stopped immediately so that there are no more victims,"" Jokowi said in a virtual address on Friday.
Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said he was appalled by the persistent use of lethal violence against unarmed civilians.
""We ... cannot afford to see our brotherly nation of Myanmar become so destabilised at the hands of a selected few, who seek to promote their own vested interests,"" he said.
Philippine foreign minister Teodoro Locsin said that ASEAN had to act. Singapore has also spoken out against the violence and the coup that triggered it.
But the military has shown no sign of being swayed and has defended its takeover, which derailed a slow transition to democracy in a country that was under strict military rule from a 1962 coup until the generals initiated reforms a decade ago.
The junta says a Nov. 8 election won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy was fraudulent and its claims were ignored by the electoral commission. It has promised a new election but not set a date.
Suu Kyi, 75, faces accusations of bribery and other crimes that could see her banned from politics and jailed if convicted.

Her lawyer says the charges are trumped up. The Nobel peace laureate, who has campaigned for democracy in Myanmar for three decades, is being held at an undisclosed location.

After a fiery start, U.S. and Chinese officials concluded on Friday what Washington called ""tough and direct"" talks in Alaska, which laid bare the depth of tensions between the world's two largest economies at the outset of the Biden administration. 
""Now that we cannot depend on strategic trust, as shown by the ongoing Anchorage meeting, to avoid crisis, we have to improve our crisis management regime, including updating the code of behaviour at close encounters,"" said General Yao Yunzhu.

Speaking at the China Development Forum to an international audience of business and policy leaders, she also said that both countries should agree on a more extensive concept for strategic stability than what the United States and Soviet Union had during the Cold War, which had been based on capability to mutually destroy each other using nuclear weapons.
China and United States should also work together to set standards for whether emerging technologies such as space, cyber and artificial intelligence should be used, or how they can be used, by the military, Yao said.

Excluding each other from this standards setting process will bring about 'grave consequences"", she warned.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Executives of a Ghanaian organisation supporting people living with HIV and AIDS demanded sex acts and money in exchange for access to benefits, the Global Fund said late on Friday in an investigation into the group it funded. 
The 18-page report entitled ""Misconduct affecting Global Fund grants"" details how representatives of the Ghana Network Association of People Living with HIV (NAP+) ""abused their positions of power and fostered a culture of sexual and financial exploitation"".
Neither the allegations nor the findings have previously been made public.
""Multiple NAP+ executives demanded that program members engage in sexual conduct or provide financial kickbacks in order to access events and benefits supported by grant funds, which constituted corrupt and coercive practices,"" the report said.
""The Global Fund's governance policy framework in relation to protection from sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment (SEAH) is inadequate,"" it added.
Global Fund Executive Director Peter Sands said in a letter released on Friday that he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the findings and that the behaviour was ""abhorrent"".
He added that the fund had ""zero tolerance"" for sexual exploitation and abuse, adding that further action to prevent, detect and respond to such incidents was planned. 
NAP+ Ghana, which received Global Fund grants indirectly via other partners, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The report said the group had not responded to its findings, but shared a comment on the investigation from the organisation's advisory board.
The board said in a statement that all but one of the accused executives denied the allegations and that it believed that executives should have the right to cross-examine their accusers.
The Global Fund is a group of governments, civil society and private sector partners which invests around $4 billion a year to fight infectious diseases.
The fund's investigators said the abuses, first reported internally in July 2019, took place between 2010 and 2019 and related to activities linked to Global Fund grants.
Nine programme participants reported they had been sexually exploited and or abused by NAP+ executives, according to the Fund's investigation alongside Ghana police, which interviewed 43 witnesses.
The United States is the Fund's biggest donor and has contributed $17.6 billion to date, according to the Fund's website. Other major donors include Great Britain, France and Canada.

The Council of Europe accord, forged in Istanbul, pledged to prevent, prosecute and eliminate domestic violence and promote equality. Turkey, which signed the accord in 2011, saw a rise in femicides last year.
No reason was provided for the withdrawal, but officials in Erdogan's ruling AK Party had said last year the government was considering pulling out amid a row over how to curb growing violence against women.
""The guarantee of women's rights are the current regulations in our bylaws, primarily our Constitution. Our judicial system is dynamic and strong enough to implement new regulations as needed,"" Family, Labour and Social Policies Minister Zehra Zumrut said on Twitter, without providing a reason for the move.
Many conservatives in Turkey say the pact undermines family structures, encouraging violence. They are also hostile to the principle of gender equality in the Istanbul Convention and see it as promoting homosexuality, given its principle of non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.
Critics of the withdrawal from the pact have said it would put Turkey further out of step with the values of the European Union, which it remains a candidate to join. They argue the deal, and legislation approved in its wake, need to be implemented more stringently.
Turkey is not the first country to move towards ditching the accord. Poland's highest court scrutinised the pact after a cabinet member said Warsaw should quit the treaty which the nationalist government considers too liberal.
Erdogan has condemned violence against women, including saying this month that his government would work to eradicate violence against women. But critics say his government has not done enough to prevent femicides and domestic violence.
Turkey does not keep official statistics on femicide. World Health Organization data has shown 38% of women in Turkey are subject to violence from a partner in their lifetime, compared to about 25% in Europe.
Ankara has taken measures such as tagging individuals known to resort to violence and creating a smartphone app for women to alert police, which has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times.

Erdogan's decision comes after he unveiled judicial reforms this month that he said would improve rights and freedoms, and help meet EU standards. Turkey has been a candidate to join the bloc since 2005, but access talks have been halted over policy differences and Ankara's record on human rights.

The eruption occurred near Fagradalsfjall, a mountain on the Reykjanes Peninsula, located around 30 km (19 miles) south-west of the capital. 
""I can see the glowing red sky from my window,"" said Rannveig Gudmundsdottir, resident in the town of Grindavik, only 8 km (5 miles) from the eruption. 
""Everyone here is getting into their cars to drive up there,"" she said.
More than 40,000 earthquakes have occurred on the peninsula in the past four weeks, a huge jump from the 1,000-3,000 earthquakes registered each year since 2014. 
Pictures on local media websites showed a bright red night sky. A picture posted on Twitter by the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) showed smoke rising from brightly glowing lava streams. 
The eruption posed no immediate danger to people in Grindavik or to critical infrastructure, IMO said.
""I think we couldn't hope for anything better than that,"" IMO volcanic hazards coordinator Sara Barsotti told Reuters. 
Unlike the eruption in 2010 of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, which halted approximately 900,000 flights and forced hundreds of Icelanders from their homes, this eruption is not expected to spew much ash or smoke into the atmosphere, IMO said.
Located between the Eurasian and the North American tectonic plates, among the largest on the planet, Iceland is a seismic and volcanic hotspot as the two plates move in opposite directions.
The source of the eruption is a large body of molten rock, known as magma, which has pushed its way to the surface over the past weeks, instigating the earthquakes. 
The number of quakes had slowed down in recent days, however, leading geologists to say that an eruption would be less likely.
Reykjavik's international Keflavik airport was not closed following the eruption, but each airline had to decide for themselves if they want to fly or not, IMO said. 

A helicopter with scientific personnel aboard had been scrambled to observe the eruption, IMO said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors charged 10 Iranian nationals on Friday over an alleged long-running scheme to dodge U.S. sanctions on Tehran by disguising $300 million in transactions, including the purchase of two oil tankers.
The eight men and two women were outside the United States and had not been arrested, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorneys Office in Los Angeles said. He declined to say if foreign governments had been asked to take them into custody. 
""In a wide-ranging scheme spanning nearly two decades and several continents, the defendants conspired to abuse the U.S. financial system to conduct hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions on behalf of the government of Iran,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Tracy Wilkison said in a statement.
All ten defendants were charged with conspiracy to violate legal sanctions against Iran. The U.S. government has also filed a civil forfeiture action seeking more than $157 million.
Reuters was not able to contact any of the accused and it was not clear if they had retained attorneys.
Prosecutors say the scheme dates back to 1999, when defendants Seyed Ziaeddin Taheri Zangakani, Salim Henareh and Issa Shayegh opened a business called Persepolis Financial Services in Los Angeles, which was used to illegally funnel U.S. dollars to Iran.
The three men later moved to Canada and the United Arab Emirates where they used Persepolis and a second front company, Rosco, to carry out further transactions, aided by defendant Reza Karimi and others, according to the criminal complaint.
In 2012 Zangakari and another defendant, Abbas Amin, wired $20 million to Malaysia to buy piping equipment for an Iranian oil company, the document said. 
Zangakari, Amin, Salim Henareh and Khalil Henraheh are charged with used a Hong Kong-based front company to quietly buy two $25 million oil tankers from a Greek businessman that same year. The Greek businessman, who is not named in the documents, was later sanctioned by the U.S. government.

ACWORTH, Ga. (Reuters) - Clutching a bouquet of flowers, Jami Webb wept alongside her fiance Kevin Chen at a makeshift memorial set up in front of Young's Asian Massage for the victims of this week's shooting rampage at three Atlanta-area spas.
Most of those who stopped and prayed in front of the flowers, burning candles and signs condemning racism and violence were strangers to the eight victims. But for Webb, 29, and her family, the visit was personal and deeply painful. 
Her father, Michael, is the former husband of the spa's owner, Xiaojie ""Emily"" Tan, one of the six Asian women killed when a gunman opened fire on Tuesday.
""Today is about taking care of family business,"" Michael Webb, 64, said on Friday, declining a reporter's request for an interview. 
Tan was a ""smart, hardworking businesswoman,"" according to her friend Greg Hynson, 54. Originally from China, she was devoted to her business but loved to travel when she could. She would have turned 50 this week.
Hynson met Tan six years ago, when the former competitive weight lifter sought out massages for his sore back. ""If I found somebody good I'd stick with them,"" he said. ""She was one of those people."" 
'HEART OF GOLD'
Relatives and friends of some of the other victims shared memories of their loved ones and expressed their grief in online posts.
""She had a heart of GOLD. She didn't care of your race, color, or religion. If you needed help, she was there,"" read a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post by Cristy Lynn McGouirk, who identified herself as a cousin of Delaina Ashley Yaun Gonzalez, who died at Young's Asian Massage in Acworth.
Gonzalez had gone there with her husband on a date night, McGouirk said in another post. The husband, Mario, survived the attack and is ""completely devastated."" 
""They were on a date night, and just wanted to relax. In a blink of an eye, she was taken from him,"" she wrote. 
The suspect, 21-year-old Atlanta-area resident Robert Aaron Long, has been jailed on charges of murdering eight people, six of whom were women of Asian descent. 
Hyun Jung Grant was one of those shot at Gold Spa in Atlanta. Her son, Randy Park, set up a GoFundMe page to help raise money for himself and his brother. The loss of their mother left them alone in the United States. 
""She was a single mother who dedicated her whole life to providing for my brother and I,"" Park wrote. ""She was one of my best friends and the strongest influence on who we are today. Losing her has put a new lens on my eyes on the amount of hate that exists in our world."" 
As of early Friday evening, Park's GoFundMe had raised nearly $1.5 million in donations, far more than its $20,000 goal. 
'I DON'T FEEL SAFE'
The makeshift memorials that took shape outside Young's and the two other spas in Atlanta resemble hundreds of others that have sprung up across the United States in recent years to honor the victims of the country's epidemic of gun violence.
The Atlanta shrines have also become places to pay tribute to victims of a nationwide surge in anti-Asian violence and harassment that many say has been largely ignored until Tuesday's bloodshed. 
Among the group of well-wishers who stopped by Young's Asian Massage was Tracey Xu, who described herself as a business professional who moved to the United States from China 24 years ago to attend school, and decided to stay.
""We're sad to the point of breaking over this,"" Xu said. ""I moved to America because it was the beacon of hope to the world. I love both China and America, but this is crazy.""
Xu said she has felt an undercurrent of racial hatred against Asians since she moved to the country, but never like now. ""It's now all out in the open, people have become emboldened,"" she said.
Xu attributed the worsening climate to former President Donald Trump's attacks on China and his labeling of the COVID-19 pandemic as the ""China virus.""

""Many Asians don't feel safe here any more. I don't feel safe, not like before.""

258,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 07:21PM ET</span>",'Tough' U.S.-China talks signal rocky start to relations under Biden,"By Humeyra Pamuk, David Brunnstrom and Michael Martina
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - U.S. and Chinese officials concluded on Friday what Washington called ""tough and direct"" talks in Alaska, which laid bare the depth of tensions between the world's two largest economies at the outset of the Biden administration. 
The two days of meetings, the first high-level in-person talks since President Joe Biden took office, wrapped up after a rare and fiery kickoff on Thursday when the two sides publicly skewered each others' policies in front of TV cameras.
The talks appeared to yield no diplomatic breakthroughs - as expected - but the bitter rivalry on display suggested the two countries had little common ground to reset relations that have sunk to the lowest level in decades. 
The run-up to the discussions in Anchorage, which followed visits by U.S. officials to allies Japan and South Korea, was marked by a flurry of moves by Washington that showed it was taking a firm stance, as well as by blunt talk from Beijing warning the United States to discard illusions that it would compromise.
""We expected to have tough and direct talks on a wide range of issues, and that's exactly what we had,"" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters moments after the Chinese delegation left the hotel meeting room.
Members of China's delegation left the hotel without speaking to reporters, but China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi later told China's CGTN television network that the discussions had been constructive and beneficial, ""but of course, there are still differences."" 
""China will firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development,"" Yang said.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was not surprised that the United States got a ""defensive response"" from China after it raised allegations of Chinese human rights abuses in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong as well as cyberattacks and pressure on Taiwan. 
But Blinken said the two sides also had intersecting interests on Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan, and climate change, and that the United States had accomplished during the meetings what it had come to do. 
""On economics, on trade, on technology, we told our counterparts that we are reviewing these issues with close consultation with Congress, with our allies and partners, and we will move forward on them in a way that totally protects and advances the interests of our workers and our businesses,"" Blinken said.
China's State Councilor Wang Yi, who joined the meetings, was quoted by Chinese state television as saying they had told the U.S. side that China's sovereignty was a matter of principle and not to underestimate Beijing's determination to defend it.
POINTED OPENING REMARKS
After pointed opening remarks https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2LH0A5 on Thursday from Blinken about China's challenge to a rules-based international order, Yang had lashed out with a long speech criticizing U.S. democracy, and foreign and trade policies. 
The United States accused China of ""grandstanding"" for its domestic audience, and both sides suggested the other had broken diplomatic protocol. 
The rebukes played out in front of journalists, but a senior U.S. official told reporters that as soon as media had left the room, the two sides ""immediately got down to business"" and held substantive talks.
While much of Biden's China policy is still being formulated, including how to handle the tariffs on Chinese goods implemented by his predecessor Donald Trump, his administration has so far placed a stronger emphasis on democratic values and allegations of human rights abuses by China.
""I am very proud of the secretary of state,"" Biden told reporters at the White House on Friday morning when asked about Thursday's meeting. 
Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first phone call as leaders last month and appeared at odds on most issues, even as Xi said that confrontation would be a ""disaster"" for both nations. Biden, who referred to Xi as a ""thug"" during his election campaign, said after the call that the United States needed to raise its game in the face of the Chinese challenge, or China would ""eat our lunch.""
In recent weeks, top Republicans have given a nod to efforts by Biden, a Democrat, to revitalize relations with U.S. allies in order to confront China, a shift from Trump's go-it-alone 'America First' strategy.
Biden has partially staked his approach on China to rebuilding American domestic competitiveness, and several top Republicans, whose cooperation will be crucial to the success of those plans, backed his administration in the face of the heated exchanges from the first day of talks. 
""I have many policy disagreements with the Biden administration, but every single American should unite against Beijing's tyrants,"" Republican Senator Ben Sasse said in a statement.
While Biden's two-month old administration is still conducting China policy reviews, Yang and Wang by contrast are veteran diplomats with decades of combined experience handling U.S.-China relations at the highest levels of the Chinese government. They are also fresh off of dealing with the Trump administration and its unorthodox approach to U.S. foreign policy. 
China's social media carried comments saying Chinese officials were doing a good job in Alaska, and that the U.S. side lacked sincerity. 
""My sense is that the administration is testing the question of whether it is possible to get real results from these dialogues,"" Zack Cooper, who researches China at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said of the U.S. side.
China on Friday put a Canadian citizen on trial on spying charges and is set for another Canadian's trial on Monday, cases embroiled in a wider diplomatic spat between Washington and Beijing.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jalina Porter reiterated calls for China to release the two men, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, from ""arbitrary and unacceptable"" detention during a regular briefing in Washington. 

A senior administration official said the United States had raised the issue with the Chinese in Alaska, including their concerns that Chinese authorities didn't allow any diplomats to enter the courtroom.

259,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 07:20PM ET</span>","Brazil government has not asked U.S. for vaccines despite Mexico, Canada deal","By Gabriel Stargardter
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's government has not yet asked the United States for spare COVID-19 vaccines, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, despite Washington agreeing this week to send 4 million doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) shots to Mexico and Canada.
The country's Senate leader says he has requested U.S. help.
Brazil's coronavirus death toll, nearly 300,000, is second only to the United States, and its health system is buckling under a record surge in cases. President Jair Bolsonaro, who has questioned the ""rush"" for vaccines, is under growing pressure to get a grip on an outbreak he once dubbed a ""little flu.""
He has been criticized for a slow and patchy immunization program, which has led to a lack of vaccine supplies in Latin America's biggest country. Earlier this month, his government asked the Chinese embassy to help secure 30 million doses from China to ensure its vaccine program does not grind to a halt. 
Despite the United States agreeing this week to loan shots to Mexico and Canada, the Bolsonaro government has not yet asked Washington for vaccine supplies, said the two sources, who asked not to be named due to political sensitivities.
Neither the Brazilian president's office nor the foreign ministry replied immediately to requests for comment. The U.S. State Department also did not respond immediately to questions.
U.S. President Joe Biden has come under pressure from countries around the world to share shots, particularly its stock of AstraZeneca vaccines, which are authorized for use elsewhere but not in the United States.
The president of the Brazilian Senate, Rodrigo Pacheco, said he wrote to Vice President Kamala Harris asking the U.S. government to allow Brazil to buy surplus vaccines. That, he said on Twitter, would help boost vaccination of Brazilians.
The AstraZeneca vaccine, which is the centerpiece of the Brazilian federal government's vaccine plan, has full regulatory approval in Brazil, meaning it could likely be used immediately. 
This week, Bolsonaro's political nemesis, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, used a high-profile CNN interview to ask the U.S. government to share its vaccine stock with Brazil.
Lula's comments - coming shortly after his graft convictions were annulled, allowing him to run in next year's presidential election - pose a challenge to Bolsonaro, as any subsequent request could let his rival score political points.
Bolsonaro's relationship with Biden also got off to a rocky start after he waited nearly a month and a half to recognize the results of the U.S. election last year. Bolsonaro enjoyed much warmer relations with Donald Trump, Biden's predecessor and a political role model for the Brazilian president.

Almost eight out of 10 Brazilians think the pandemic is out of control in their country and more than half are ""very afraid"" they will get infected with coronavirus, a new Datafolha poll said.

Nicolette Davis, who now serves in the U.S. military, told the newspaper that in 2017 Reed inappropriately placed his hand on her during a ""networking trip"" in Minneapolis.
""A drunk congressman is rubbing my back,"" the newspaper quoted Davis texting a co-worker at the time. ""HELP HELP.""
""This account of my actions is not accurate,"" Reed said in a statement, declining to answer further questions.
Davis could not be reached for immediate comment.
Cuomo, who would be up for re-election in November 2022, is under increasing pressure to resign following a series of allegations of sexual misconduct and that he had concealed the number of New York state nursing home deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Investigations into those allegations are ongoing.
Reed, 49, was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010 and has gained a reputation of being a moderate Republican willing to work with Democrats on some issues.
He is a member of the ""Problem Solvers Caucus"" that late last year played a role in the crafting of an emergency relief package to address the pandemic.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Many Americans have seen stimulus checks hit their bank accounts in recent days, but some, including many migrants living in the United States illegally, are excluded from receiving the aid.
In New York, immigrant advocate groups like the New York Immigrant Coalition (NYIC) and Make the Road are pushing for the state to pass a $3.5 billion fund to help them.
""Street vendors, these are people who are out there providing services every day... but yet they're not eligible for stimulus,"" said Theresa Thanjan, manager of member engagement at the NYIC.
""Those folks are completely left out ... so we're trying to find a way to support them,"" said Thanjan.
Reyna, who declined to give her last name, said she had not received any stimulus and was unsure how she would cope.
""I have a job for every eight days, working, making $80. And I can't live off $80,"" she said. ""I am scared right now. I owe two months of rent.""
She said she had lived in the New York area for more than two decades after crossing the border from Mexico, and works as a house cleaner.
At a rally on Thursday to promote the rights of cleaners, Reyna, who lives with her two young children, said she was able to find steady cleaning gigs five days a week before last year's lockdown. But the jobs have since dwindled to one.
An activist with Make the Road, Reyna recounted how some of her fellow cleaners have braved the pandemic only to end up catching the coronavirus while on the job.

""It all stresses me out, looking for money,"" she said. ""What am I going to do?""

264,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 05:56PM ET</span>",Mexico rolls out steps to tighten southern border with Guatemala,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has launched new measures to deter illegal crossings at its southern border with Guatemala, including posting militarized police and using drones to monitor entry points, the national migration institute (INM) said on Friday.
The announcement comes after Reuters reported that Mexico was planning to beef up border enforcement along its southern reaches to stem a sharp increase in migrants illegally entering the country to head for the United States.
Many migrants entering Mexico hope they can claim asylum in the United States. Thousands come from a trio of Central American countries with high levels of violence and poverty. 
The INM said the measures were aimed at protecting the rights of children from Central America who were being used by criminal gangs as a means of facilitating migrants' passage north.
Since March 1, the INM said it has registered 4,180 children and teenagers traveling without authorization through Mexico, some with older family members, and some unaccompanied. 
The INM said so-called ""guides"" are telling people to take children along to make it easier to enter the United States.

The tighter measures at Mexico's border with Guatemala, which also ban non-essential crossings such as tourism, will be in place for a month with the potential to be renewed.

265,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 05:50PM ET</span>",Biden steps up family expulsions as U.S.-Mexico border arrivals keep climbing,"By Jose Luis Gonzalez, Mica Rosenberg and Ted Hesson
CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - The United States is expelling migrants to Mexico far from where they are caught crossing the border, according to Reuters witnesses, in a move that circumvents the refusal of authorities in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas who stopped accepting the return of migrant families with younger children.
The practice is a sign that President Joe Biden is toughening his approach to the growing humanitarian crisis on the U.S.-Mexican border after his administration's entreaties for Central American migrants to stay home have failed to stop thousands from heading north.
Some families caught at the border in Texas' Rio Grande Valley said in interviews they were flown to El Paso, Texas, after being held in custody just a few days. From there, they were escorted by U.S. officials to the international bridge to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, around 800-miles (1,300 km) away from where they were first picked up by U.S. border patrol agents.
A Reuters photographer saw planes landing in El Paso this week that were loaded with dozens of migrant families with young children, including babies in diapers, and then saw the same families crossing the international bridge.
Some passengers interviewed by Reuters as they were getting off the plane said they had been awakened in their holding cells at night by border agents and not told where they were going as they were loaded on buses and taken to the airport. 
Landon Hutchens, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesman, said that due to a lack of capacity in the Rio Grande Valley, migrants have been sent to El Paso for processing, as well as Laredo, Texas, and San Diego, California.
Gloria Chavez, the U.S. Border Patrol chief for the El Paso Sector, said that El Paso had been receiving families from the Rio Grande Valley since March 8. Chavez said the priority was to expel them to Mexico, but that Mexico could only receive a limited amount of families from the region per day. She said some families were still being released to shelters in the United States.
The shuttling of migrants to El Paso was first reported by the Dallas Morning News. 
While the United States has been expelling thousands of people crossing the border illegally, Tamaulipas, which sits across the border from Texas, has not been accepting families returning with younger children, presenting a conundrum for the Biden administration.
U.S. authorities have been releasing hundreds of families to shelters and giving them notices to appear in immigration court to reduce overcrowding at border facilities.
Dylan Corbett, the director of the Hope Border Institute, an advocacy organization, said the majority of families expelled to Ciudad Juarez after crossing in south Texas have children under 7 years of age. 
""They have been returned to Juarez to a situation of extreme vulnerability,"" facing dangers from human traffickers and organized criminal groups, Corbett said in an interview, adding that shelters in Mexico are full due to the pandemic. 
Edna Sorto, who came from Honduras with her two young sons, sat on the floor in a state government immigration office in Ciudad Juarez shortly after walking over the bridge from El Paso. Dozens of families milled around the office with some toddlers and babies sleeping on blankets on the floor.
""They didn't ask us anything about why we came or where we were going or who could receive us in the United States,"" Sorto said through tears and over the cries of children in the background who said they were hungry. ""We are just going to wait here and see what they tell us, see if we can find a place to stay.""
UNDER PRESSURE
The new practice of expelling families to a different part of Mexico comes as the Biden administration faces pressure by both critics and some supporters for its handling of the crisis on the border.
Opposition Republicans blame the increase in illegal border crossings on Biden's immigration policies and what they say is his mixed messaging to would-be migrants.
Biden administration officials' warnings to migrants not to make the journey north appear to be ignored, as people smugglers point to some families being allowed in to persuade would-be migrants that the border is open.
""We have been clear from all levels of government that the border is closed and the majority of individuals will be turned away or expelled under Title 42,"" a White House spokesman said, referring to a public health order instituted under former President Donald Trump amid the pandemic. The order allows migrants, including families, to be ""expelled"" to Mexico or their home countries.
Gil Kerlikowske, who was CBP commissioner for three years under former President Barack Obama, said the Biden administration's heavy reliance on messaging was ""a huge mistake.""
""We have 25 plus years of messaging in Mexico and Central America, from placards on buses and bus shelters to radio spots and more, saying, 'Don't come, it's dangerous,' and for 25 years that message has been completely unheard.""
Democrats and activists meanwhile say children are being kept in border patrol custody for too long and should be released more quickly to family members or other sponsors.

More than 500 of the roughly 4,500 unaccompanied children being held in sparse border patrol facilities as of Thursday have been there for more than 10 days, above the legal three-day limit, according to U.S. government data shared with Reuters.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivian former President Jeanine Anez, arrested last week over allegations she was part of a coup in 2019, will be transferred to a hospital for medical attention due to ill health after a judge's ruling, her attorney said on Friday.
""We have confirmed that her health is still delicate,"" lawyer Ariel Coronado told Radio Compañera.
Anez, 53, served her fifth day in pretrial detention on Friday, accused of participating in an alleged coup against former President Evo Morales in 2019. She strongly denies the charges and says she took over by constitutional succession.
Coronado added that Anez was not on a hunger strike as some reports had suggested, but was struggling to take in food since being first detained last Saturday at her home in the central city of Trinidad before being taken to La Paz.
""She cannot eat. She eats and vomits. For that reason she is eating very little,"" he said. ""And her arms are bruised from the injections they have given her.""
Anez's daughter raised concerns about her mother's health on Wednesday after authorities confirmed she was taken ill in prison but an ambulance called for her was later sent away.
Bolivia's socialist government, led by close Morales ally Luis Arce, has sought the arrest of a number of former officials, as well as military and civil leaders over accusations they conspired to oust Morales.

Anez denies the allegations and claims she is the victim of political persecution.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - The Baptist church where the suspect in this week's Atlanta-area spa killings was a member issued a statement on Friday decrying the attack as a wicked betrayal of faith and describing the eight victims, including six women of Asian descent, as blameless.
Robert Aaron Long, 21, has been charged with eight counts of homicide in Tuesday's fatal shooting of four people at two day spas in Atlanta and four others at a massage parlor in Cherokee County, about 40 miles (64 km) north of the state capital.
In a statement, the Crabapple First Baptist Church in Milton, Georgia, said Long's ""extreme and wicked act is nothing less than rebellion against our Holy God and His Word.""
Investigators said Long had admitted carrying out the attacks, claiming he was driven by internal conflict over what he described as a sex addiction, not racial animus toward Asians. 
But the rampage has stirred fear among Asian Americans, who see the crimes as a part of a national surge in racially motivated attacks that has accelerated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were due to visit Atlanta on Friday to offer support to Asian-Americans and meet with leaders of the area's growing Asian-American and Pacific Islander community.
Authorities stressed they have not ruled out charging Long with hate crimes even though Long claims that racial bias was not his motivation.
""Aaron's (NYSE:AAN) actions are antithetical to everything that we believe and teach as a church. In the strongest possible terms, we condemn the actions of Aaron Long as well as his stated reasons for carrying out this wicked plan,"" said the church, where Long and his father were members. ""No blame can be placed upon the victims.""
A former roommate of Long's at a rehabilitation center said the suspect would feel shame and remorse after frequenting massage parlors for sex, then ""return to God.""
Fulton County officials on Thursday identified the four Atlanta victims as Soon C. Park, 74, Hyun J. Grant, 51, Suncha Kim, 69, and Yong A. Yue, 63. All were of Korean descent, according to South Korea's consulate in Atlanta.
The Cherokee County victims were identified by authorities as: Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, Paul Andre Michels, 54, Xiaojie Yan, 49, and Daoyou Feng, 44.
The Georgia killings have prompted police departments to step up patrols and visibility in Asian-American communities around the country. Hate crimes against Asian Americans in 16 major cities rose 149% in 2020 over 2019, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.
A former Cherokee County Sheriff's department spokesman who came under criticism for saying Long had ""a really bad day"" and who had previously promoted T-shirts blaming Asians for the pandemic has been reassigned, the New York Times reported.

Captain Jay Baker, who is named as director of communications on the sheriff's website, was replaced as by Erika Neldner, whose email signature identifies her as communications director.

268,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 04:23PM ET</span>",Myanmar junta faces calls to halt bloodshed but more die in anti-coup protests,"(Reuters) - International pressure on Myanmar's military junta to halt its repression of pro-democracy protests following last month's coup increased on Friday but on the streets, security forces shot dead at least nine demonstrators in an unrelenting crackdown.
Calls for dialogue and the end to the bloodshed came from several of Myanmar's Southeast Asian neighbours led by Indonesia - an unusual stance in regional diplomacy.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned what he denounced as the military's continuing brutal violence. A ""firm, unified international response"" was urgently needed, he said, quoted by his spokesman.
The U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation condemning the coup and lawmakers decried the increasingly harsh tactics used to suppress the demonstrations that have swept over Myanmar since the overthrow of the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1.
The total number of people killed in weeks of unrest has risen to at least 234, based on a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group.
But crowds of protesters turned out again on Friday.
Security forces opened fire in the central town of Aungban as they tried to clear a protesters' barricade, media and a witness reported.
""Security forces came to remove barriers but the people resisted and they fired,"" the witness, who declined to be identified, said by telephone.
An official with Aungban's funeral service told Reuters eight people were killed, seven on the spot and one wounded person who died after being taken to hospital.
The spokesman for the junta was not available for comment but has previously said security forces have used force only when necessary. 
One protester was killed in the northeastern town of Loikaw, the Myanmar Now news portal said. One person was shot and killed in Myanmar's main city Yangon, social media posts showed. Reuters could not confirm that death.
Police ordered people in some Yangon neighbourhoods to dismantle barricades and have been hunting for protest leaders, residents said. Parts of Yangon are under martial law. 
Demonstrators were also out in the second city of Mandalay, the central towns of Myingyan and Katha, and Myawaddy in the east, witnesses and media reported.
The military has shown no sign of being swayed and has defended its takeover, which derailed a slow transition to democracy in a country that has been ruled by the army for most of its post-independence history.
It says a Nov. 8 election won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy was fraudulent and its claims were ignored by the electoral commission. It has promised a new election but not set a date and has placed Myanmar under a state of democracy.
Suu Kyi, 75, faces accusations of bribery and other crimes that could see her banned from politics and jailed if convicted.
Her lawyer says the charges are trumped up. The Nobel peace laureate, who has campaigned for democracy in Myanmar for three decades, is being held at an undisclosed location. 
Authorities have tightened restricted on internet services, making information increasingly difficult to verify, and also clamped down on private media.
""ABHORRENT ACTIONS""
Ambassadors of Western countries condemned the violence as ""immoral and indefensible"", in particular in Yangon's Hlaing Tharyar industrial district, where dozens were killed over several days after Chinese-owned garment factories were torched last weekend.
""Internet blackouts and suppression of the media will not hide the military's abhorrent actions,"" they said in a statement on Friday.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo called for an end to the bloodshed.
In some of the strongest comments yet by a regional leader on the crackdown, he said he would ask Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, the current chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to call an urgent meeting.
""Indonesia urges that the use of violence in Myanmar be stopped immediately so that there are no more victims,"" Jokowi said in a virtual address.
""The safety and welfare of the people must be the top priority. Indonesia also urges dialogue, that reconciliation is carried out immediately to restore democracy, to restore peace and to restore stability in Myanmar.""
Backing Indonesia's call for a meeting, Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said he was appalled by the persistent use of lethal violence against unarmed civilians.
Philippine foreign minister Teodoro Locsin said that ASEAN had to act.
The 10 ASEAN countries have long held to the principle of not commenting on each other's internal affairs so the words were notable.
The coup leader, General Min Aung Hlaing, took part in a video conference with regional defence chiefs on Thursday, his first international engagement since seizing power.
At the meeting, the head of Indonesia's armed forces, Hadi Tjahjanto, expressed concern over the Myanmar situation, the Indonesian military said.
Singapore's military chief, Lieutenant-General Melvyn Ong, also expressed ""grave concern"" and urged Myanmar to avoid lethal force, the Singapore defence ministry said.
The U.S. resolution condemned the coup and the detention of Myanmar's civilian leaders, called for the release of all those detained, and for those elected to serve in parliament to resume their duties.
And in a sign of uneasiness in the business world about the situation, French power group EDF (PA:EDF) confirmed it had suspended the development of a hydropower project in Myanmar over human rights concerns.
""It is official,"" a spokesman for EDF told Reuters.
The European Union is expected to impose sanctions on military leaders and army-run businesses next week, following similar action by Washington. 
Three international aid agencies criticised the military for occupying educational facilities and hospitals. More than 60 schools and universities had been taken over, a serious violation of children's rights, Save the Children, UNESCO and UNICEF said in a joint statement.

Teachers were beaten in at least one incident, they said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Friday that anger in Northern Ireland's unionist community over the Brexit divorce deal was serious and cautioned the European Union that such tensions could ultimately undermine stability unless properly addressed.
Northern Ireland has always been the toughest issue in the Brexit divorce and just a month after the United Kingdom exited the EU, the European Commission briefly threatened to impose emergency controls on vaccines crossing the Irish land border.
Though the EU swiftly stepped back from that, tensions have been rising in Northern Ireland, a British province. 
Britain last month unilaterally extended a grace period for checks on food going from Britain to Northern Ireland - which effectively stayed in the EU's single market and customs union under the divorce deal to avoid a hard border with Ireland.
The EU has started legal action over Britain's move. 
A senior pro-British loyalist said on Friday that Northern Ireland's 1998 peace agreement is under threat and a ""Pandora (OTC:PANDY)'s box"" of protest and political crisis will be opened unless the EU agrees to significant changes to the Brexit deal.
The peace accord, known as the Belfast or Good Friday Agreement, ended three decades of violence between mostly Catholic nationalists fighting for a united Ireland and mostly Protestant unionists, or loyalists, who want Northern Ireland to remain an integral part of the United Kingdom.
The deal guaranteed an open Irish land border to help safeguard peace, free trade and travel on the island.
""If the unionist community feel that the Protocol is breaching the Good Friday agreement and moving away from the spirit of it, then we're in quite a dangerous place in terms of stability of not just the executive but the north-south institutions,"" British Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told reporters.
Loyalist paramilitary groups told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this month that they were temporarily withdrawing support for the peace agreement due to concerns over the Brexit deal.
Lewis mentioned that warning.
""I don't agree with that, I think it would be a mistake, but it does underline the sense of tension ... We have to recognise there is that tension there,"" he said.
Lewis said Britain had to take unilateral action to extend grace periods, otherwise shops would have run out of goods in Northern Ireland.
""If we hadn't, if we'd have had another set of empty shelves this week ... the fallout from that in the unionist community means the Protocol would, I think, have been fatally flawed.""
Irish nationalists Sinn Fein accused Lewis of hypocrisy and said his comments demonstrated a failure of the ""rigorous impartiality"" required by the Good Friday Agreement. 
""This is the same British government who have signed up to the Protocol with the EU and have committed to its implementation,"" Sinn Fein Member of Parliament Chris Hazzard said in a statement.
The European Commission briefly threatened in January to impose emergency controls on vaccines crossing the open Ireland-Northern Ireland border, a step that Lewis said had ratcheted up tensions in the unionist community.

""We're still dealing with the fallout from that.""

Local media said more than a dozen bodies of people shot dead were found on Thursday in the eastern city that is the stronghold of Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), whose assault on the capital Tripoli was repulsed last year. 
Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibeh, who was selected through a United Nations-led process and took office this week, tweeted that such events cannot be tolerated or covered up.
""I gave direct instructions to the Interior Minister to deal with this event and I requested the Attorney General to open an investigation,"" he said.
In Benghazi, the Security Headquarters, which includes both police and military units under LNA control, initially denied any bodies had been found but said later on Friday it would issue a statement on the matter. 
Libya has endured a decade of chaos and violence since the NATO-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi, as armed groups gained control over city districts leading to an epidemic of abductions and killings. 

The main western and eastern factions that split apart in 2014 have publicly accepted Dbeibeh's government, widely seen as Libya's best hope for peace in years, though huge challenges remain.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris visited Georgia on Friday to meet with Asian-American community leaders after a deadly shooting rampage in the state, shifting the focus of a trip originally planned to promote the newly enacted $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.
A 21-year-old man has been charged with murdering eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at three spas in and around Atlanta on Tuesday, rattling Asian Americans already grappling with a rise in hate crimes directed at them since the COVID-19 pandemic began. 
Biden and Harris will meet community leaders and state lawmakers from the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community to hear concerns about the killings and discuss a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, the White House said.
Investigators said the suspect, an Atlanta-area resident who is white, suggested that sexual frustration led him to commit violence. Political leaders and civil rights advocates have speculated the killings were motivated at least in part by rising anti-Asian sentiment.
Biden has also directed White House officials Cedric Richmond and Susan Rice to engage with the community, and supports recent legislation calling for an expanded Justice Department review of COVID-19-related hate crimes.
The president and vice president changed the focus of the trip after the shootings, feeling ""it was important to change the trip a little bit and offer their support and condemn the violence,"" a White House official said.
Biden called on U.S. lawmakers to quickly pass a COVID-19 hate crimes bill, saying while the motive was still unknown in the Georgia killings, the nation faced an ""ongoing crisis of gender-based and anti-Asian violence."" 
""It’s time for Congress to codify and expand upon these actions — because every person in our nation deserves to live their lives with safety, dignity, and respect,"" he said in a statement released as he headed to Georgia.
On Friday, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said acts of violence against the community were exacerbated by language used by the Trump administration that preceded Biden's.
Biden stumbled as he climbed aboard Air Force One to head to Georgia. White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters he was ""doing 100 percent fine."" She suggested high winds at Joint Base Andrews near Washington may have been a factor.
Biden ordered the U.S. flag flown at half-staff at the White House to honor the victims of Tuesday's shootings.
Asian-American voters constitute one of the fastest growing racial and ethnic groups in the country and turned out in record numbers in the presidential battleground states in the 2020 election, according to data from TargetSmart, a Democratic political data firm. 
In Georgia, Asian-American and Pacific Islander voters exceeded their total 2016 turnout by 58%, the firm said. These voters were key to carrying Biden to success in states where the race was close such as Georgia, the firm said.
The Democratic president's trip was initially part of the ""Help is Here"" campaign, which he kicked off on Monday to promote his promise of ""shots in arms and money in pockets,"" after signing the COVID-19 relief bill into law last week. Biden has traveled to Pennsylvania and Harris has been to Nevada and Colorado to tout the benefits of the relief package.
Before they were due to meet with the Asian-American community, Biden and Harris visited the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta where they received a coronavirus update and Biden thanked health officials for their effort fighting the pandemic.
""This is a war and you are the frontline troops,"" Biden said. ""We owe you a debt of gratitude for all the lives you've saved.""
They also plan to meet with Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia gubernatorial candidate, whose get-out-the vote efforts are widely credited with helping Biden carry the state last November and their fellow Democrats win two U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia this year that gave them control of the chamber.
A bill passed by the Republican-controlled Georgia House of Representatives this month would restrict ballot drop boxes, tighten absentee voting requirements and limit early voting on Sundays, curtailing traditional ""Souls to the Polls"" voter turnout programs in Black churches.
Republicans across the country are using former President Donald Trump’s false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election to back state-level voting changes they say are needed to restore election integrity. 

""Voting rights is something that is on the minds of everyone on that trip,"" the White House official said.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson received his first dose of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccine on Friday and urged the public to do the same, saying ""he did not feel a thing.""
Johnson, 56, received his vaccine at the same hospital where almost a year ago he was put in an intensive care unit and given oxygen via a tube in his nose after he contracted the virus and fell seriously ill. He later said he was so sick that plans were drawn up on how to announce his death.
""I literally did not feel a thing. It was very good, very quick,"" Johnson said after receiving the injection at St Thomas' Hospital in London. 
""I cannot recommend it too highly, everybody when you do get your notification to go for a jab, please go and get it, it is the best thing for you, best thing for your family and for everyone else.""
Pictures showed the prime minister wearing a black mask, a shirt and tie with his sleeve rolled up while a nurse gives him the vaccine. 
Britain broke its record for the most coronavirus shots given out in one day on Friday and almost half of all adults have received one dose, making it one of the fastest countries in the world to roll out a vaccine programme. 
This success has helped the ruling Conservatives regain the lead over the main opposition Labour Party in opinion polls after the prime minister last year was accused of acting too slowly to stop the spread of the virus. 
Johnson received his vaccine as European countries on Friday resumed using the AstraZeneca shot after regulators said its benefits outweighed any risks following recent reports of blood clots.
Countries including Germany and France reversed their decision to temporarily pause its use after reports of about 30 cases of rare brain blood clots sent scientists and governments scrambling to determine any link. 

The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed by scientists at the University of Oxford, has also been at the centre of tensions between Britain and the European Union, after Brussels expressed anger over the lack of deliveries of the shot coming from Britain.

(Reuters) - In the days before an east Los Angeles COVID-19 vaccination site opened in a Latino neighborhood that was hard-hit by the pandemic, people flooded California's online booking system to snap up appointments. The software accepted hundreds of ineligible residents from wealthy enclaves such as Beverly Hills. 
Jim Mangia, chief executive of St. John's Well Child & Family Center, said not one of the first 300 people to book an appointment lived in an east Los Angeles ZIP code and many were not eligible under existing guidelines for age and occupation. 
Mangia unplugged the site from the state's My Turn online system. Then 15 staffers spent two days calling ineligible people to cancel appointments. Food service union officials and local immigration support groups helped recruit eligible residents. Four outreach workers walked the streets for hours, talking with people and posting flyers emblazoned with a phone number for scheduling vaccine appointments.
Such low-tech, shoe-leather strategies are informed by on-the-ground data that government-funded community health clinics such as St. John's have been collecting for decades. 
President Joe Biden announced in February that he was turning to the expertise and deep community connections of the more than 1,300 such clinics across the country. As part of a strategy to increase vaccinations in communities devastated by coronavirus, administration officials reached out to clinics in every state, where staff know that the impoverished Latinos and Blacks they serve are being vaccinated at about half the rate of whites - despite being at least twice as likely to die from COVID-19. 
Reuters spoke with a dozen clinics in Los Angeles, Oakland, Philadelphia, Detroit, Miami and Birmingham, Alabama, that are getting vaccines into the arms of people who have trouble securing appointments via overrun internet booking systems or getting to mass vaccination sites due to lack of technological savvy, time or transportation. 
The clinics offer low- to no-cost medical services to almost 30 million people across the country – including essential workers who harvest, sell and cook food; clean homes and hospitals; and care for children, the disabled and elderly. In its first four days, St. John's inoculated 1,400 people in east LA - among them food cart vendors, housekeepers and gardeners, Mangia said. 
The United States is in a race to rollout vaccines as more contagious variants of the virus are discovered, posing a new threat to areas where infection rates are highest. 
'HOW EQUITY GETS IGNORED' 
States including California and Texas redact information about race and ethnicity when they report vaccination data, citing patient privacy. That results in an incomplete picture that hobbles efforts to identify gaps, guide ongoing policies and direct resources to areas beset by entrenched medical inequities.
As of Thursday, the CDC only had race and ethnicity data for 53% of the roughly 74 million people who have received at least one vaccine dose. Within that group, 66% were white, almost 9% were Hispanic or Latino and nearly 8% were Black, the data showed https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographic. 
""Often times this is how equity gets ignored – because it just doesn't get measured in the first place,"" said Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, an epidemiologist and former director of Detroit's health department. 
The federal government requires the community clinics it funds to collect race and ethnicity data. But they had vaccinated relatively people few before the latest push - 370,079 shots as of March 5.
The community clinics use robust patient data to bolster vaccination campaigns. Their staff are also trusted healthcare providers who can help dispel hesitancy toward the vaccine in vulnerable communities that is rooted in distrust of the government and historical episodes of medical exploitation.
AltaMed Health Services, one of the nation's largest community clinic operators, uses records from its roughly 300,000 Southern California patients to create lists of eligible patients. Dr. Sherrill Brown, its medical director, said staff then reach out via text and email. 
""We try to bombard them with the information so that they have as many opportunities as they can to schedule an appointment,"" Brown said. 
Philadelphia's Public Health Management Corporation identified 12,000 vaccine-eligible patients at its five federally funded clinics and added a special phone tree for vaccine calls. The Philadelphia clinics are inoculating unsheltered patients, public housing residents and teachers at schools for students with special needs. 
Alabama's mostly Black north Birmingham, a neighborhood grappling with poverty and health problems linked to steel plant pollution, got its first vaccines after the Biden administration intervened. Alabama Regional Medical Services, a community clinic serving the area, on Saturday started vaccinating its own patients and residents referred by local ministers and public housing groups. 
""We're going to clear the backlog for the 35207 ZIP code,"" said Christopher Mosley, its outreach director, referring to local demand. 
Federally allocated vaccines are also starting to flow into metro Detroit, Michigan, said Anthony King, CEO of the Wellness Plan, a clinic operator in the city that is a hot spot in the state with the nation's highest infection rate. 
Meanwhile, California doubled doses shipped to clinics in neighborhoods where COVID-19 cases and death are highest, and quickly vaccinated 400,000 of its most vulnerable residents.
""That's how it should have been all along,"" said Dr. Jerry Abraham, who leads the vaccine team at Kedren  Community Health  (NYSE:CYH) Center, which serves south-central Los Angeles' Latino and Black communities. 

As he spoke, security guards waved seniors through its main checkpoint for no-wait inoculations.

""Yes, I will do the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" Draghi said in his first news conference since becoming prime minister in February.
Italy resumed use of the Anglo-Swedish vaccine on Friday after a three day pause due to concerns about possible blood clotting side effects, following a green light from Europe's medicines watchdog EMA.

Both fled Ukraine and went to Russia in 2014 after street protests in which more than 100 demonstrators were killed in the capital, Kyiv, as security forces cracked down.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy provided details of the sanctions in a televised statement, confirming an announcement earlier on Friday by Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council.
""This decision by the National Security and Defense Council can be described in two words - it is logical and strange. It is logical that Ukraine is ... introducing such sanctions, and it's strange that this hasn't been done since 2014,"" Zelenskiy said.
Representatives of Yanukovich did not respond to a request for comment.
A Ukrainian court in 2019 sentenced him in absentia to 13 years in jail for treason.
Yanukovich has denied all allegations against him and blamed armed nationalist radicals for fomenting violence in the protests that prompted him to flee. 
Azarov left for Russia soon after resigning in January 2014.
""This is political persecution, unmotivated, a common extrajudicial reprisal,"" a representative of Azarov quoted him as saying.
An Interpol red notice issued in 2015 at the request of Ukrainian authorities cited accusations against Azarov including embezzlement and misappropriation.

Interpol cancelled that red notice in 2017 after Azarov successfully challenged it, according to an Interpol document viewed by Reuters. Interpol said it did not comment on individual cases.

Obama visited Havana in March 2016, the first trip by a U.S. president to Cuba in 88 years. It was the culmination of a diplomatic opening towards the Communist-run country, seeking to put an end to years of Cold War-era hostility.
His successor Donald Trump unraveled that detente and tightened the crippling U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, arguing that he would force democratic change. 
Biden, who was vice president under Obama, vowed during his campaign to reverse Trump's policy shifts that ""have inflicted harm on the Cuban people and done nothing to advance democracy and human rights.""
But the White House said earlier this month a broader Cuba policy shift was not currently among Biden's top priorities, even if it was ""carefully reviewing policy decisions made in the prior administration, including the decision to designate Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism.""
""I am very concerned that Biden will not continue in the same vein as Obama and will allow himself to be influenced by the politics of Cubans in Miami,"" said retired Cuban economist Ileana Yarza. 
Trump may have lost last year's election but he did win the swing state of Florida, in part due to a Republican campaign to paint Biden as in hock to the radical left, a charge that hit home with the state's large Cuban-American population. 
The Cuban economy is now suffering its worst crisis since the fall of former benefactor the Soviet Union, partly due to a slew of new U.S. sanctions under Trump which ended cruises to Havana, limited flights, reduced remittances and dampened foreign investment.
Families separated by the Florida Straits are more divided than ever after he reduced the Havana embassy to skeletal staffing, following a series of unexplained illnesses among diplomats. Consular services for Cubans have been moved to third countries.
Sarah Batista, who runs a souvenir crafts shop in Old Havana, said private entrepreneurs like her had especially benefited from the detente and ensuing tourism boom. 
""With Trump, please! Everything has been declining, you know? And now with the pandemic it is even more so,"" she said. 
""Hopefully, with this other president (Biden), we can have the same luck and the same opportunity that we had with Obama.""
The U.S. sanctions have hurt a state-run economy already smarting from its own inefficiencies and a decline in aid from ally Venezuela.
Proponents of the sanctions say it is these and the resulting economic squeeze that have forced Cuba to pick up market-style reforms once again lately. Critics underscore the cost to a population dealing with shortages of basic goods like food and medicine.
Analysts say it is still early days and Biden has many more pressing foreign policy issues after four years of the turbulent Trump presidency. But for Cubans, every extra day counts.
""In fact, already, the policies aren't the same because there are no new sanctions,"" said Carlos Alzugaray, a former Cuban diplomat.

""But everything that the previous (Trump) administration did that stands in the way of a return to the path of normalization has not begun to be reversed.""

Earlier this month the ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced she would formally investigate war crimes in the Palestinian Territories, a move welcomed by the Palestinian Authority and denounced by Israel.
The Article 18 notification letters were sent on March 9 to all parties concerned including Israel and the Palestinians, the prosecutor's office said in a statement to Reuters.
Israel and the Palestinian Authority now have one month to inform the court if they are conducting their own investigations into the alleged crimes and want the probe deferred while that is ongoing.
Palestinian officials confirmed they had received the notification. A spokeswoman for the Israeli foreign ministry declined to comment on whether Israel had received it, saying it was a question for the ICC. 
Bensouda said in December 2019 that war crimes had been or were being committed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. She named both the Israeli military and armed Palestinian groups such as Hamas as possible perpetrators.
The ICC is set up as a court of last resort which can step in only if states are unable or unwilling to prosecute their nationals for crimes which fall under ICC jurisdiction. 
Israeli officials argue that the ICC has no jurisdiction because Israel carries out its own investigations, including into what the Israeli military says were “exceptional incidents” during the 2014 war in Gaza between Israel, Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups.

Under the court's statute the prosecutor ""shall defer to the state's investigation of those people"" about whom the court has informed states in the notification if there local investigations or prosecutions ongoing of the same incidents. Such a deferral will be reviewed every six months to ensure the local probes and prosecutions are genuine efforts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who is Black, clashed with her Chinese counterpart on Friday when she described her own experience with racism as a challenge, but said for millions of people in countries like China and Myanmar it was deadly. 
During a U.N. General Assembly meeting to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said: ""Racism was and continues to be a daily challenge wherever we are. And for millions, it's more than a challenge. It's deadly."" 
""Like in Burma, where Rohingya and others have been oppressed, abused, and killed in staggering numbers. Or in China, where the government has committed genocide and crimes against humanity against Uighurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang,"" she said, referring to the region in northwest China. 
China's deputy U.N. Ambassador Dai Bing responded that Thomas-Greenfield had ""in an exceptional case admitted to her country's ignoble human rights record, but that does not give her country the license to get on a high horse and tell other countries what to do.""
The conflict underscored tensions between the world's two biggest economic powers a day after Washington and Beijing had their first high-level meeting since Joe Biden became U.S. president in January.
""If the U.S. truly cared about human rights, they should address the deep-seated problems of racial discrimination, social injustice and police brutality, on their own soil,"" Dai told the 193-member General Assembly. 
Thomas-Greenfield, who said she is a descendant of slaves, recalled her own experiences with racism such as working as a teenage babysitter when the child asked ""if I was an n-word because her dad had used that word for me.""
The police killing in May of George Floyd in Minnesota and other black Americans elsewhere in the United States sparked demonstrations against racism and excessive use of force by law enforcement across the nation last summer.
""We have flaws. Deep, serious flaws. But we talk about them. We work to address them. And we press on, in hopes that we can leave the country better than we found it,"" said Thomas-Greenfield, who also referred to attacks in Georgia that included six victims of Asian descent.
China has been widely condemned for repressing Uighur Muslims and other minorities at complexes in the remote Xinjiang region, which it describes as ""vocational training centers"" to stamp out extremism. It denies accusations of abuse.

Dai said there was no ""genocide"" in Xinjiang.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Neydi, a Bolivian primary school student, logs on to virtual classes like many kids around the world during the pandemic. The only difference is the setting: surrounded by tombstones in a public cemetery in highland city La Paz.
Bolivia has kept its schools largely closed during the COVID-19 outbreak, pushing many parents to find novel ways to get their kids online for class. It is particularly challenging in a country with sporadic internet connectivity, limited access to expensive computers, and high costs for mobile data.
Neydi's mother, Jeanete Alanoca, a 30-year-old indigenous Aymara who makes a living working at the General Cemetery of La Paz, decided to bring her daughter along with her to make use of the area's free WiFi. Neydi does not have her own device and must use her mother's cellphone to do her schoolwork.
""Before the pandemic, I sent her to school and my in-laws also took care of her and picked her up from school. Because of this situation we are in, I have to bring her to work,"" Alanoca told Reuters.
Alanoca's work involves renting out stepladders at the cemetery to relatives and friends paying respects to loved ones, whose cremated remains are often kept in rows of elevated compartments.
Now she also helps her daughter out with her classes amid the graves. Without the free WiFi, the family would need to rely on expensive cellphone data. Her other elder daughter goes with her in-laws to use their phone.
She said neither mother or daughter were put off learning by the unusual classroom surroundings.
""They say the cemetery is scary, but I can't do anything about that because either way I have to be here with my daughter and doing homework because I don't have another cellphone. That's why we're here.""

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia must dismantle criminal networks and corruption in the Pacific port city of Buenaventura via its legal system and social investment to reestablish security and guarantee human rights for its residents, a United Nations agency said on Friday.
Buenaventura, with a population of 432,000, is marked by regular clashes between armed groups fighting for control of the country's main Pacific port and drug trafficking routes, with poverty-stricken civilians getting caught in the middle.
""The violence is destroying the culture and social fabric of the black and indigenous communities who live in the region, who represent more than 90% of the population,"" said Juliette de Rivero, representative for the U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights, in a statement following a trip to the city.
So far this year Buenaventura has seen 41 homicides, 13 forced disappearances, and the forced displacement of more than 8,000 people, on top of threats to local activists and human rights defenders, the U.N. Office for Human Rights in Colombia has found.
The agency urged Colombian authorities to come together to implement agreements reached with Buenaventura residents following recent protests, as well as the peace deal reached in 2016 between the government and the now demobilized guerrilla group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
The peace deal ended the leftist rebel group's part in Colombia's armed conflict, which has left 260,000 dead and displaced millions.

Turkey's foreign ministry did not comment on the reported request, which would mark a first concrete step by Ankara towards easing tensions with Cairo. Better relations between the two powers could help efforts to resolve conflict in Libya, and ease maritime disputes in the east Mediterranean. 
Egypt's Information Minister Osama Heikal told Reuters he welcomed the move, calling it a ""good initiative that creates an appropriate climate for discussing issues of dispute between the two sides"".
Nour's Al-Sharq television is one of three prominent Egyptian opposition channels in Istanbul, including Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist-leaning stations, whose programmes have irritated the Cairo government. 
Ties have been strained since Egypt's army toppled a Muslim Brotherhood president close to Ankara after protests in 2013. 
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan, whose ruling AK Party has its roots in Islamist politics, has not recognised Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Sisi, the former army chief, took power in 2013 and was later elected president.
Many Egyptian opposition figures, including the Muslim Brotherhood which is outlawed in Egypt, took refuge in Turkey.
Last week President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey had resumed contact with Egypt and expressed hopes that the process would continue ""much more strongly"".

(Reuters) - The judge in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged in the death of George Floyd, on Friday denied Chauvin's request to move his trial to a different county, saying publicity on the case had spread far and wide.
Chauvin's lead lawyer, Eric Nelson, has complained to the court that publicity around the trial has tainted the jury pool in and around Minneapolis, citing in particular the city's announcement last week that it would pay Floyd's relatives $27 million to settle their wrongful-death lawsuit.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill ruled against Chauvin, saying that delaying or moving the trial would make it no easier to seat an impartial jury in one of the most scrutinized cases in the history of U.S. policing.
""I don't think there's any place in the state of Minnesota that has not been subjected to extreme amounts of publicity in this case,"" Cahill said. 
The judge, however, partially granted a separate request by Chauvin to show the jury evidence of an earlier episode in which Floyd was arrested by police. That occurred about a year before Chauvin held his knee for about nine minutes on the neck of a handcuffed, prone Floyd on May 25, 2020.
Cahill and the lawyers in the case have questioned 57 potential jurors in court since last week to weigh their impartiality as Chauvin, dressed in a suit and tie, takes extensive notes on a yellow legal pad. 
All of them said they were aware of video showing Chauvin, who is white, with his knee on Floyd's neck as Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, begged for his life. Almost all said they had seen at least some of the footage, which sparked global protests against police brutality and racism.
Twelve jurors have been seated so far, and the court continued on Friday seeking two more members to serve as alternates.
'VIRTUALLY THE SAME SITUATION'
Two autopsy reports concluded that Floyd's death was a homicide, caused in part by the way the arresting officers held him on the ground. Both reports noted Floyd had underlying health conditions, including hypertension, and the drugs fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system.
Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. One of Chauvin's main defenses will be to dispute the cause of death, arguing that it was actually the fentanyl, a powerful opioid, that killed him.
Prosecutors from the Minnesota attorney general's office have complained the defense is seeking to smear Floyd's character, and that whether he had high blood pressure or struggled with an addiction is irrelevant to the charges.
Nelson said a recent search he conducted of the police car in which Chauvin and other officers were trying to place Floyd after his arrest disclosed a pill containing fentanyl and methamphetamine on the back seat that bore traces of Floyd's saliva. 
He argued that the new evidence meant the judge should reconsider an earlier decision not to allow Nelson to show jurors evidence about a prior arrest on May 6, 2019. 
In that arrest, which involved different officers, a panicked Floyd swallowed opioid pills as police, including one with a drawn gun, approached the car he was in as part of a narcotics investigation. Floyd and the officers ended up speaking calmly and Floyd was later taken to a hospital for treatment.
Prosecutors fought the defense effort, writing in a court filing on Thursday: ""Mr. Floyd's 2019 arrest simply sheds no light on when or how he consumed drugs nearly a year later. The new discovery of a pill in the squad car does not change anything.""
On Friday, Cahill ruled that very limited evidence from the 2019 arrest could be shown, only as much as sheds light on the dispute over the cause of Floyd's death a year later.
""The whole point there is we have medical evidence of what happens when Mr. Floyd is faced with virtually the same situation: confrontation by police at gunpoint, followed by a rapid ingestion of some drugs,"" Cahill said in his ruling.
He said the jury could see a portion of the 2019 video from police body-worn cameras showing up to the point where they remove Floyd from the car and handcuff him. The jury could also see images of the pills found in the car seat in the 2019 arrest. 

Cahill also said the defense could call the paramedic who treated Floyd to testify on his ""bodily reaction"" to swallowing drugs.

The Russian embassy in Sofia said in a comment on its website it expected that until a court ruled on the case that all speculation about Russia's alleged involvement in intelligence activities against Bulgaria's interests should stop.
Chief Prosecutor Ivan Geshev told a news briefing it was the first time such a spy ring had been uncovered in Bulgaria since the end of the World War Two. 
Five of the suspects were arrested in a large-scale operation by national security officers in Sofia on Thursday, when one of the men tried to escape, the prosecutors said. 
They said a former senior official from Bulgarian military intelligence had recruited people with access to classified information from Bulgaria, NATO and the European Union.
The leader of the group used his wife to pass the information to an official at the Russian embassy in Sofia, said Siyka Mileva, a spokeswoman at the state prosecution's office. 
""We can conclude that the criminal group has posed a serious threat for the national security by collecting and handing to a foreign country information which constitutes state secrets of Bulgaria, NATO and the European Union,"" she said.
The prosecutors said the group had been operating for a long time and that the investigation was ongoing.
Bulgaria, an EU and NATO member, has expelled six Russian diplomats for suspected spying in the past two years.
""In the context of the complexity of the international situation, the 'tireless' attempts to drive a wedge into the Russian-Bulgarian dialogue and once again demonise our country are obvious,"" the Russian embassy said in a statement.

In communist times, the Balkan country was Moscow's most reliable ally in eastern Europe. Despite periodic strains, Russia remains Bulgaria's biggest energy supplier and the two countries retain close cultural and other links.

Tourists are still not allowed to stay in hotels or holiday lets in Germany, leaving foreign holidays one of the few options for those wanting to get away, although the German government still advises against non-essential travel. 
""It is very, very, very exciting and it feels wonderful to be flying again, even if it is for only one week,"" said tourist Bettina, who works for a travel company, as a group of exuberant young holidaymakers danced outside the airport. 
The new arrivals had flown in from various German cities including Berlin, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf and Hamburg. They all had to provide test results not more than 72 hours old at the airport showing they were COVID-free.
""It was an amazing opportunity to be able to come here despite the coronavirus,"" said student Linda Tlucker, 23, who had travelled from Berlin for a two-week holiday. 
But while German tourists can enjoy the Balearic resorts, Spaniards will be unable to do so because of a ban on travelling between regions over Easter, leaving many angry. (nL8N2LF4PP)
TIMELY BOOST
Asked about the restrictions facing Spaniards, Tlucker said: ""It's probably not that fair. But if the region says it is OK (for us to come), there is not much citizens can do about it.""
The return of German tourists provides a timely boost for one of Spain's hardest-hit industries. Foreign visitors to Spain fell 80% to 19 million in 2020, the lowest level since 1969, because of the pandemic and lockdown restrictions. 
In 2020 the tourism industry accounted for between 4% and 5% of Spain's national output, according to estimates from the Funcas think-tank, down from 12% in 2019. 
It was not all smiles at the airport on Friday, however, as the sun-seekers were met with drizzly weather conditions.

""The weather is quite bad and it feels like being in Germany,"" one said.

Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu accused Greek coast guard units of beating up seven migrants and leaving them at sea without a lifeboat or dinghy off the Greek island of Chios, which is less than 5 miles (8 km) from Turkey's coast.
The Greek coast guard said it was aware of a search and rescue operation in Turkish waters by Turkish authorities but denied any involvement, and said the Turkish accusations were insulting.
""We don't treat migrants or people in danger that way,"" Greek coast guard spokesman Nikolaos Kokkalas told Reuters.
In a tweet, Soylu said the Greek coast guard ""battered 7 migrants tonight, took their belongings, tied their hands with plastic handcuffs, and threw them into the sea without lifejackets and boats."" Soylu said they had been left to die.
He also published a video which he said showed the rescue operation, with Turkish teams picking up three people from the sea, and subsequent treatment of those rescued.
One of those, identifying himself as Ahmed, said the seven people had left Cesme three days ago for Chios. He said they had been on the Greek island for two days before they were beaten, their possessions seized and they were left at sea.
Turkey has repeatedly accused Greek border authorities of violating human rights by abusing and harassing migrant boats in the Aegean, charges that Athens has denied. 
Hundreds of thousands of Middle East migrants and refugees used Greece as their entry point to Europe through Turkey in 2015 and 2016, until a deal between Ankara and the European Union reduced the flow across the Greek and Turkish land and sea borders.
Turkey hosts more than three million refugees and migrants, many from neighbouring Syria, while tens of thousands are waiting in Greece for asylum applications to be processed, mostly in camps where conditions have been described as dire.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Mozambicans uprooted by a jihadist insurgency have the potential to become radicalised themselves if they lack basic essentials and root causes of the conflict are not addressed, United Nations officials warned on Friday.
Islamic State-linked militants have in the past year escalated attacks in Mozambique's northernmost province Cabo Delgado, murdering villagers, fighting the army and seizing towns. 
Beheadings have been a hallmark of attacks.
The number of people fleeing their homes swelled from 70,000 to about 700,000 over the last year, said Raouf Mazou, the U.N. refugee agency's assistant high commissioner for operations.
Many initially made their way south to the well-protected provincial capital of Pemba to live, often in cramped conditions, with host families.
The government has started moving people to resettlement sites outside the city, Gillian Triggs, the U.N. refugee agency's assistant high commissioner for protection, told reporters at a briefing alongside Mazou. 
Following a camp visit, Mazou and Triggs said more funding and planning was needed to cover food, medicines and education. 
Triggs said the site they visited was hard to access via road and close to a swamp, leaving residents worried about snakes, lacking electricity and with minimal healthcare. 
""Where (young people) do not have services, where they do not have access to quality education or opportunities for livelihoods, for jobs, for the future, then I think radicalisation is always an option,"" she said. 
Though there are reports of foreign fighters in the insurgency, the conflict is rooted in local issues from poverty and unemployment to perceived corruption and religious discrimination.
""Individuals we saw in the camp were angry,"" Mazou said, noting their desire for more international help.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark, Sweden and Norway said on Friday they needed more time to decide whether to use AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine while Finland joined them in putting the shots on hold, even though the EU drug watchdog said the benefits outweighed any risks.
""We need time to get to the bottom of this,"" Soren Brostrom, head of the Danish Health Authority, told reporters on Friday.
Several European countries last week suspended use of the vaccine following reports of rare instances of blood clots in some people who had been vaccinated.
On Friday nearly a dozen of them resumed inoculations on the EMA's recommendation.
""This does not change the fact that, on the basis of a precautionary principle, we are continuing our suspension, because we need to understand this better, so that we can say with certainty that we recommend this vaccine,"" Brostrom said.
Finland, which had not previously suspended the vaccine, announced it would halt the use of the AstraZeneca shot while investigating two suspected cases of blood clots.
""After doing the investigation we can better inform people about the risk associated with the vaccine if there is one,"" said Taneli Puumalainen, chief physician at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare.
Health authorities in all four Nordic countries said they planned to decide on the future use of the AstraZeneca vaccine next week.
Norway has so far reported five cases in which recipients of the vaccine were later admitted to hospital with a combination of blood clots, bleedings and low platelets, one of whom has died.
A sixth person, who also got the vaccine, has died from brain a haemorrhage in combination with a low count of platelets.
""These cases are rare, but very serious. We can not rule out that these cases may be linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" the Norwegian Medicines Agency said. 
Sweden is also looking into isolated cases of blood clots and coagulatory issues among people who took the vaccine, including two deaths, though authorities have said any possible link to the inoculations remains uncertain.
""We know already that we have quite a few people that have begun to be hesitant about the vaccine,"" Chief Epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, the architect of Sweden's no-lockdown pandemic strategy, told public service broadcaster SVT.
""That means it is hugely important that we are able to issue clear communications about how and why we continue to use (the AstraZeneca vaccine).""
Sweden, Finland and Norway have seen a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks. Denmark has seen numbers fall and is gradually reopening society.

AstraZeneca said on Sunday a review of safety data of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the United Kingdom and European Union with its vaccine had shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told a news briefing that the United States will send doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine, which are slightly more than the 2.5 million U.S. officials had previously indicated.
""We thank President Biden for sending us these vaccines,"" Lopez Obrador said in the eastern state of Veracruz, noting the deal was reached on good terms for Mexico and that he hoped the vaccines would be arriving from next week.
Due to delays in promised deliveries, Mexico has scrambled to obtain enough vaccines for its inoculation plans, leaning increasingly on Russia and China to secure doses.
Officials announced the deal just as Mexico said it would restrict travel on its southern border with Guatemala to curb the spread of COVID-19, dovetailing with efforts to contain a surge in U.S.-bound illegal immigration from Central America.
Mexican and U.S. officials said the two steps were not a quid pro quo, but foreign policy experts noted that the agreements suited both governments.
Lopez Obrador said that in return for the vaccines, Mexico would give the United States what it had ""always"" given, namely ""friendship and cooperation across all spheres.""
He said that the vaccines would help Mexico reach its goal of inoculating its population of 126 million, beginning with a first shot for all people over 60 by the end of April.

Lopez Obrador on Friday also praised U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) for its vaccine deliveries, which had previously been subject to delays due to supply bottlenecks.

The man was shot in the head during a protest near the villlage of Beit Dajan, near Nablus, and was taken to a hospital where he later died, the Palestinian health ministry said.
The Israeli military said it was examining the incident. 
A Reuters photographer said a group of Palestinians threw stones at two Israeli soldiers posted at the protest, and the soldiers then opened fire.
The Israeli military said that ""dozens of Palestinian rioters hurled rocks"" at its troops, who ""responded with riot dispersal means and by firing into the air"".
""We are aware of reports regarding a Palestinian casualty. The cause of the injury is still unknown. The incident is being examined,"" it said.
Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
The protest in Beit Dajan, near the city of Nablus, was a weekly demonstration against Israel's West Bank settlements. 
The Palestinians, who have limited self-rule in the West Bank, say Israel's settlements there will deny them a viable state. Most countries view the settlements as illegal under international law.

Israel disputes this, citing security needs as well as biblical and historical ties to the land. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU leaders will endorse prolonged export checks and seek to coordinate an eventual lifting of travel curbs when they meet next week to discuss COVID-19 vaccination shortages, according to a draft decision seen by Reuters.
The bloc is facing a third wave of the pandemic but has been struggling to ensure enough vaccines, its sluggish inoculation campaign falling behind those of ex-EU member state Britain, the United States and Israel.
""Accelerating the production, delivery and deployment of vaccines remains essential to overcome the crisis,"" the 27 national leaders are due to say in a joint statement following their next talks on March 25-26.
They would back extending a scheme requiring authorisation for any COVID-19 vaccine exports, a measure to keep the scarce shots under closer tabs, until the end of June.
The EU has so far blocked one shipment of vaccines to Australia and says overall it has sent more than 40 million doses to countries around the world since the beginning of February. 
The leaders will also discuss the latest threat by their executive European Commission to stop exports to Britain, which the EU says has not shared shots amid cuts in deliveries to the bloc promised by the Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN).
While France, Germany and Italy broadly support tighter export curbs on those who do not reciprocate, countries including the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland are more cautious about cutting off the UK. 
EU countries have often failed to stick to a joint approach on COVID-19, fighting over vaccines and equipment, or introducing unilateral travel and border checks that weigh on trade and businesses inside the bloc.
But with more vaccines expected in the second quarter, southern EU countries most reliant on tourism are seeking a more coordinated reopening with the help of new, EU-wide travel passes.
""Preparations should also start on a common approach to the gradual lifting of restrictions, to ensure that efforts are coordinated when the epidemiological situation allows for an easing of current measures,"" the leaders are due to say.
""...Work on COVID-19 interoperable digital certificates should be taken forward as a matter of priority,"" they are due to say, though there is scepticism in countries including Belgium, France and Luxembourg over the proposal. 

For the time being, however, several EU countries are reimposing tighter curbs on daily lives again after a year of lockdowns and tentative easing of COVID restrictions in Europe.

297,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 10:40AM ET</span>",'How to end a war you didn't win': Yemen's Houthis seek Saudi concessions,"By Aziz El Yaakoubi
DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen's Houthis say a U.S. plan for a ceasefire in their six-year war against a Saudi-led military coalition does not go far enough, and are ramping up pressure on Riyadh to lift a sea and air blockade before any truce deal is agreed.
With the United Nations warning of a looming large-scale famine, U.S. special envoy on Yemen Tim Lenderking toured the region this month to press the warring sides to agree a nationwide truce to revive U.N.-sponsored peace talks on ending the conflict.
But making clear the Houthis believed the plan must go further, Chief Houthi negotiator Mohammed Abdulsalam told Reuters: ""We have discussed all these proposals and offered alternatives. We continue to talk."" 
Saudi Arabia, which leads a military coalition that intervened in Yemen in March 2015, has been trying for over a year to exit the war but wants more assurances from the armed Houthi movement on the security of its borders and on curbing the influence of its rival, Iran, in Yemen. 
Tehran denies arming the Houthis.
A main sticking point is the Houthi demand that the coalition lift the blockade - which has largely contributed to Yemen suffering the world's worst humanitarian crisis - before any truce deal is agreed, three sources involved in the talks said.
The Saudi-led coalition controls Yemen's airspace and waters, including off the Houthi-held Hodeidah port on the Red Sea which handles more than 70% of Yemen's imports. The Houthis hold most of northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.
""The issue is seen as an existential threat in Saudi Arabia. Free shipping and daily flights between northern Yemen and Iran would cause real anxiety in Riyadh,"" said a source familiar with the talks. ""It is a case study on how to end a war that you didn't win.""
Lenderking has not provided details in public of what he called a ""sound plan"". But Abdulsalam said it included allowing flights to Sanaa airport from some destinations with prior coalition authorisation.
He said the Houthis agreed to inspection of ships heading to Hodeidah and verification of bank transfers and goods' origins, but that the coalition says port revenues must go to Yemen's Saudi-backed government.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson said Lenderking has presented a fair proposal for a nationwide ceasefire, with elements that would immediately address Yemen’s dire humanitarian situation.  
""The Houthis must demonstrate their willingness to adopt and adhere to a comprehensive, nationwide ceasefire and enter negotiations,"" the spokesperson said.
DEVIL IN THE DETAILS
The challenge, the sources and analysts said, is finding middle ground.
""From what I understand, the Saudis are willing to make concessions,"" said Peter Salisbury, a senior analyst at International Crisis Group. ""But there is a lot of devil in the details to be worked out, in terms of what a ceasefire looks like and what an easing of restrictions looks like.""
The stakes are high as the Houthis step up missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, including on oil facilities, and make gains in an offensive to take Yemen's gas-rich Marib region, the last stronghold of the internationally recognised government that the Houthis ousted from power in Sanaa. 
Biden has said the United States will no longer support offensive operations by the coalition while continuing to help Saudi Arabia defend itself.
""I think the military escalation in Marib and elsewhere shows that Iran wants to pressure the U.S. indirectly on the nuclear file, I do not see another reason for it,"" a Saudi official, who declined to be named, said.
Abdulsalam rejected this.
Iran's foreign ministry spokesman said this month that Tehran supports a truce in Yemen ""with lifting of the blockade"".
Biden aims to restore a 2015 international nuclear pact with Iran that his predecessor Donald Trump quit in 2018, but Washington and Tehran cannot agree on who should move first.
The Biden administration has used a carrot and stick approach on Yemen, including lifting terrorist designations on the Houthis imposed by the Trump administration and later sanctioning two of the group's military leaders.
Lenderking has said Washington will work with the Yemeni and Saudi governments to find a way to deliver fuel to Yemenis and restore humanitarian aid funding for the north.
But time is running out. Fuel shortages have knocked out water pumps, generators in hospitals and disrupted aid supplies in a country where 80% of the population need help.
U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths said on Tuesday that no fuel imports had been permitted to enter Hodeidah since January. 
As of March 17, at least 13 fuel tankers were held -- some for more than six months -- by coalition warships off Hodeidah despite them having U.N clearance, U.N. data showed. 

Four ships cancelled and left without docking at the port after waiting for months.

298,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 10:25AM ET</span>","In Dominican Republic, proposal to ease abortion ban polarizes nation","By Ezequiel Abiu Lopez
SANTO DOMINGO (Reuters) - As the abortion rights movement gains pace across Latin America, the issue is heating up in the Dominican Republic - one of the few countries in the region with a total ban on abortion - where activists were camped for an eighth day on Friday outside the president's palace. 
Latin America, where the Catholic Church has held cultural and political sway for centuries, has some of the most stringent abortion laws in the world. Argentina legalized the medical procedure in December and abortion rights activists hope it will give impetus to a regional movement.
In the Dominican Republic, a group of presidential advisors on Tuesday recommended a pending update of the country's 19th century penal code - stalled since the end of the 1990s over the issue - revise its stance.
The advisors recommended the code allow terminations when a woman's life is in danger, the pregnancy is not viable or in cases of rape or incest - similar to the easing of abortion laws conservative Chile approved in 2017.
But the justice commission of the chamber of deputies rejected that on Wednesday, proposing instead that the penal code allow abortion only where the mother's life is threatened.
Although the proposal is not yet scheduled for debate, it has sparked the ire both of religious groups that want to maintain the total ban and abortion rights activists who say abortion should be allowed in all three circumstances proposed by the presidential advisers.
Without change, abortion rights activists say, women will simply continue resorting instead to dangerous clandestine abortions that account for 13 percent of maternal deaths in the Caribbean country.
""We are the women dying, we are the women in danger,"" said Margarita Mercedes, one of the dozens of activists that set up camp seven days ago outside the national palace in downtown Santo Domingo. 
Their protest comes ahead of a march some Christian and civil society groups plan on holding in the capital on March 27 to show support for upholding the absolute ban on abortion. 
""All three instances (in which the advisors suggested allowing abortion) are murder,"" the Archbishop of Santo Domingo, Francisco Ozoria, said on Thursday. ""If they approve any one of them, whichever it is, it's a murder.""
Christian groups already once thwarted an attempt to ease the country's abortion ban, when they won a case at the Supreme Court challenging a new penal code approved by Congress in 2014 on the basis of errors in legal proceedings. 

The update to the penal code was subsequently withdrawn and the debate over abortion died down - until now.

The refinery is operated by state-controlled oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222). The attack, which happened at 6:05 a.m. Saudi time, did not result in injuries or deaths, and did not disrupt the supply of oil or oil derivatives, the energy ministry said. 
The Houthis said earlier in the day that they had hit a facility belonging to Aramco in Riyadh, without specifying the targets they said were hit. 
""Our armed forces carried out at dawn today an operation... with six drones which targeted the Aramco company in the capital of the Saudi enemy, Riyadh,"" said Yahya Sarea, a Houthi military spokesman.
Aramco did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment but said it would do so ""at the earliest opportunity"". 
The Iran-aligned Houthis have stepped up attacks into Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, in recent weeks. 
Sarea said operations against Saudi Arabia will continue and escalate as long as Saudi ""aggression"" against Yemen continues. 
The Saudi energy ministry said this and other attacks had targeted the security and stability of the world's energy supply, not just Saudi Arabia. 
Saudi Arabia leads a military coalition which intervened in Yemen in March 2015 against Houthi forces, which ousted the internationally-recognised Yemeni government from power in Sanaa in late 2014. 
Riyadh says it intercepts most of the drones and missiles which the Houthis say they launch at airports, air bases and energy infrastructure, but some do inflict damage. 
On March 7, the coalition said a barrage of drones and missiles had been intercepted en route to targets including an oil storage yard at Ras Tanura, the site of a refinery and the world's biggest offshore oil-loading facility. A residential compound in Dhahran used by Saudi Aramco was also targeted.
Sarea warned ""foreign companies and citizens"" to avoid military sites and key infrastructure. 
In renewed diplomatic efforts to end the war, the United Nations and United States have urged the Houthis, who are also pressing an offensive against the government-held city of Marib in Yemen, to turn to negotiations rather then military escalation.

The youth movement Fridays for Future, which urges global leaders to listen to climate scientists and stop global warming, had called on children around the world to join a global online school strike on Friday. 
Thunberg, who is 18 years old, sparked the global climate protest movement, including large protests, in 2018 by skipping school on Fridays to protest outside the Swedish parliament. 
""Today is the global strike day and since it's not really possible to strike in big numbers in Sweden yet we are doing this action instead. We are striking in shifts so that we control the amount of people who are here,"" Thunberg told Reuters. 
The protesters on Friday called on leaders to introduce and fulfil binding annual short-term carbon emission targets, rather than what they describe as vague and empty promises for far off dates but .
""What we need are not meaningless goals for 2050 or net-zero targets full of loopholes, but concrete and immediate action in-line with science,"" the movement said on its website. 
Thunberg said the world was still not treating climate change like a crisis, unlike the COVID-19 epidemic. 
""The first step must be to start treating it like a crisis and to just take in the full picture, to see this in a holistic point of view,"" she said. ""Science says that we can still avoid the worst consequences. So it's possible, but it's not possible if we continue like today."" 

Sweden has banned public gatherings of more than eight people as part of its efforts to slow the pandemic.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian prosecutors on Friday accused hardline Islamic cleric Rizieq Shihab of incitement and causing widespread violations of coronavirus restrictions, in his first court appearance in a case his legal team says is politically motivated.
Dressed in a white turban and tunic at his virtual hearing, Rizieq yelled that he was being ""forced and denigrated"" and that it was his right to appear in a regular courtroom. He previously refused to take part in online proceedings. 
Judges feared his physical appearance at a court could draw huge crowds amid an epidemic that has seen more than 1.4 million people infected with COVID-19 in Indonesia. 
Some of his supporters on Friday gathered outside the East Jakarta court where the judges were sitting.
Prosecutors detailed how Rizieq had breached large-scale social restrictions in November by calling people to rally and by hosting a wedding for his daughter, events that collectively drew more than 10,000 people. 
The charges stem from the cleric's return in November from three years in self-imposed exile in Saudi Arabia, which was celebrated with mass gatherings of his followers. 
Thousands flocked to the airport to welcome Rizieq home, with mass crowds forcing the toll road to close. Some 33 guests at the wedding he held a few days later tested positive for the virus and prosecutors said Rizieq was also infected. 
Rizieq, the spiritual figurehead of the now-banned group, the Islamic Defender's Front (FPI), was jailed in 2008 for inciting violence and in 2017 fled Indonesia and charges of breaching pornography laws and insulting state ideology. Those charges have since been dropped.
The cleric became a figurehead for conservative Islam and a politically influential movement that helped bring down Jakarta's former Christian governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, who was an ally of President Joko Widodo and was jailed in 2017 for insulting Islam.
Rizieq's legal team said the case was part of a ""large-scale intelligence operation"" that could see him jailed for a long time. 
""Rizieq Shihab is a religious and national figure, it is not right to make him a target,"" it said in a statement. 

(This story corrects the year former Jakarta governor was jailed to 2017, not 2007, in paragraph 9)

LONDON (Reuters) - Northern Ireland's 1998 peace agreement is under threat and a ""Pandora (OTC:PANDY)'s box"" of protest and political crisis will be opened unless the European Union agrees to significant changes to the Brexit deal, a senior loyalist warned on Friday.
The 1998 accord, known as the Belfast or Good Friday Agreement, ended three decades of violence between mostly Catholic nationalists fighting for a united Ireland and mostly Protestant unionists, or loyalists, who want Northern Ireland to stay part of the United Kingdom.
David Campbell, chairman of the Loyalist Communities Council, which represents the views of loyalist paramilitaries, said he was calling for dialogue with the EU and Ireland to change the Northern Irish Protocol that he said had breached fundamental principles of the 1998 deal. 
""We're saying there is a window of opportunity for constructive dialogue to see if we can actually get a workable solution, and I've no doubt we could get a workable solution, but it does require Brussels and Dublin to return to honouring the core guarantees of the (Belfast) Agreement,"" Campbell told Reuters.
""If it doesn't happen, then they are opening a Pandora's box which leads to significant protest, to the bringing down of the Northern Ireland executive and then into a significant political crisis,"" Campbell said. 
Loyalist paramilitary groups told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this month that they were temporarily withdrawing support for the peace agreement due to concerns over the Brexit deal.
The EU and Ireland say there is no reason to change the Brexit divorce deal which was signed by Johnson and is now an international treaty, though unionists say the negotiations failed to take account of their community. 
""Loyalists are extremely angry right across the community,"" Campbell said, adding that the community was more angry than at any other time since the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which gave Dublin a consultative role in the governance of Northern Ireland.
""It's an anger that transcends class and age groups - 80-year-olds are just as vexed as teenagers are - so it has succeeded in uniting all the disparate unionist groups and parties,"" he said.
ANGER RISING 
Unionists say the Brexit deal is unfair as it prevents a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland but effectively cuts Northern Ireland off from the rest of the United Kingdom by creating a border in the Irish sea.
Campbell said that as such, the Brexit deal was one-sided and breached the principles of the 1998 deal.
""The peace agreement is certainly under threat,"" Campbell said, adding that the devolved power-sharing government of Northern Ireland, which requires the support of politicians representing both communities to function, was likely to collapse.
Northern Ireland's devolved government and assembly have suffered periodic breakdowns during previous crises since 1998.
""Unless there are changes, I can't see the Northern Ireland executive being sustained beyond the ending of the current pandemic,"" he said, adding that there would be significant protests over coming months and going into the summer.
So is Northern Ireland on the brink of violence?
""I was one of the unionist negotiators in the talks and for 20-odd years we have worked constructively together and you now potentially face the undoing of that,"" he said. 
""The current leaderships of the loyalist organisations are under extreme pressure from, let's just say, the young Turks who perhaps see an opportunity to go to war on their terms.""

The main loyalist paramilitary groups were not formally parties to the 1998 deal, but endorsed it at the time and decommissioned their weapons in the years that followed.

303,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 09:01AM ET</span>",Analysis: Move to ban Kurdish party shows Erdogan's march to nationalism,"By Daren Butler
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - In the early days of peace talks with Kurdish militants in 2013, Turkey's then-Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan spoke out against ethnic divisions and declared, ""we are a government that has trampled on every kind of nationalism"".
Eight years on, long after the talks collapsed in a surge of violence, analysts say Erdogan, now president, is dependent on his nationalist allies in parliament led by Devlet Bahceli. 
This has limited his political options, fuelled autocratic moves and alienated Kurds across the country, they say.
Erdogan's long pivot from boosting Kurdish rights to a hard pact with nationalist Turks was reinforced this week when a top prosecutor moved to ban the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) over militant ties, after months of calls to do so from Bahceli's Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).
Cengiz Candar, who wrote a report examining how to end the decades-old insurgency before the peace process, said the timing of the HDP charges, just before an MHP congress, showed Bahceli's heavier hand in decision-making.
""It illustrates that Turkish autocracy is getting much more repressive against the Kurds and... even more nationalistic,"" the veteran political commentator told Reuters. ""Either Erdogan is their (MHP's) hostage, or acts in unison with them.""
""The tunnel into which the government has pushed Turkey is getting even darker. We don't see light at the end."" 
Echoing that view, HDP co-leaders Pervin Buldan and Mithat Sancar said in a statement the AKP had ""presented a gift to the MHP congress through the judiciary, and the prosecutors have acted upon political instructions"". 
The government says Turkey's judiciary is independent.
Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AK Party (AKP), in power since 2002, itself narrowly survived a closure case in 2008. He has spoken out in past years against shutting parties, including the ban on another pro-Kurdish party in 2009.
But since the ceasefire with Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants ended in 2015, Erdogan has taken a harder line. Thousands of HDP members have been arrested in a crackdown and many of its lawmakers and mayors unseated and jailed. 
Erdogan's communications director Fahrettin Altun said the HDP had ""organic ties"" to the PKK. The HDP, Turkey's third-largest party, denies PKK links.
More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict the PKK launched in 1984. It is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.
CHANGED POLITICAL CLIMATE
In Erdogan's early years as leader, inspired by hopes of taking Turkey into the EU, he expanded political and cultural rights for Kurds, who make up some 20% of the country's 84 million population.
Erdogan has defended his alliance with the MHP, saying it showed personal and political differences could be overcome in the national interest.
But polls show support has slipped for the AKP and MHP as the government battles the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Elections are not scheduled until 2023.
Gonul Tol, director of the Middle East Institute's Turkey programme, said Erdogan had sought to divide the opposition by pursuing a policy of criminalising the HDP since 2015. 
The move to shut it down ""upped the ante"", she said, after the government was criticised for a failed mission to rescue 13 Turkish captives, soldiers and police in Iraq last month. Ankara says they were executed by PKK militants there. 
""Erdogan and his nationalist ally will continue to use the Kurdish card to keep their base together,"" Tol said.
""They are hoping to keep the Kurdish voter at home in the next elections by shutting down the HDP, but it might very well backfire (and) mobilize Kurdish voters to support the opposition.""
Galip Dalay, a fellow at the Bosch Academy, said the timing of the closure case will not play well politically for the AKP.
""(It) will make the prospect of Erdogan finding new partners more difficult amongst opposition political actors,"" he said.
Dalay said the president's options appeared limited to his nationalist alliance, which is shedding support, or returning to a parliamentary system that was replaced by a presidential one in 2018, when the AKP and MHP agreed their alliance.

""This move burns further bridges between the governing AK Party and the Kurds, and contributes to the Kurds' sense of political alienation,"" he said.

304,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 08:56AM ET</span>","Special Report: As U.S. schools shuttered, student mental health cratered, Reuters finds","By Benjamin Lesser, M.B. Pell and Kristina Cooke
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A few weeks after San Francisco’s school district moved to remote learning last year in hopes of halting the spread of the coronavirus, Kate Sullivan Morgan noticed her 11-year-old son was barely eating. He would spend days in bed staring at the ceiling.
The mother formed a pod with three other families so the students could log on to their online classes together. That helped, but her eldest remained withdrawn and showed little interest in his hobbies, such as playing piano and drawing. Then her younger son, then 8, started to spiral down.
“He would scream and cry multiple times per hour on Zoom,” she said. “It was all really scary and not in keeping with his personality.” She scaled back her job as a healthcare regulatory attorney to be there for her sons.
In December, with schools in San Francisco still closed, the family packed up and moved more than 1,700 miles, to Austin, Texas, so the children could attend school in person. “Kids are resilient, but there is a breaking point,” Sullivan Morgan said.
With schools nationwide locked down amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health consequences on students have come into a sharp focus.
Reuters surveyed school districts nationwide in February to assess the mental health impacts of full or partial school shutdowns. The districts, large and small, rural and urban, serve more than 2.2 million students across the United States.
Of the 74 districts that responded, 74% reported multiple indicators of increased mental health stresses among students. More than half reported rises in mental health referrals and counseling.
Nearly 90% of responding districts cited higher rates of absenteeism or disengagement, metrics commonly used to gauge student emotional health. The lack of in person education was a driver of these warning signs of trouble, more than half of districts said.
The stresses didn’t affect only students: 57% of responding districts reported an increase in teachers and support staff seeking assistance.
School closures have affected districts in every state. In the spring of 2020, all U.S. K-12 public schools closed, at least temporarily, to help slow the spread of COVID-19. As of February, 57% of students attended public schools that were completely or partially closed, according to Burbio, a service that tracks school openings.
Some school boards, teachers union leaders and parents still advocate full or partial school closures to protect the health of children or to prevent community spread. Yet research over the last year has shown that public schools that follow social distancing guidelines typically experience low rates of spreading COVID.
“Though outbreaks do occur in school settings, multiple studies have shown that transmission within school settings is typically lower than – or at least similar to – levels of community transmission, when mitigation strategies are in place in schools,” said a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. “The majority of cases that are acquired in the community and are brought into a school setting result in limited spread inside schools, if comprehensive mitigation strategies are in place.”
Severe cases among children comprise less than one tenth of one percent of all deaths, the CDC said. Of the 36,860 overall child deaths over the last year, 216, about a half percent, involved COVID-19.
In Rhode Island, virtual students were more likely to test positive for COVID than students attending in-person, state education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green told researchers and doctors in January. “It’s really important to have data,” Infante-Green said. “Most of the cases we’ve seen have been outside of school.”
Dimitri Christakis, director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute, said the Reuters survey affirms concerns he has had since schools stuck with remote learning.
“We’ve done our children a tremendous disservice,” Christakis said.
As students stay sheltered in their homes, away from friends and teachers, other COVID-related factors can cause the stresses to cascade. The anxiety from seeing a parent lose work. The death or illness of a family member from the disease.
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES
More than a dozen school district leaders told Reuters of students suffering silently with depression, eating disorders, neglect and emotional, physical or sexual abuse. Were students in a school setting, these warning triggers would be more easily noticed, they say.
In California, Joel Cisneros, director of school mental health for the Los Angeles Unified School District, worries about those who fall through the cracks.
“The most concerning thing would be when students or parents or caregivers try to weather this by themselves,” Cisneros said. “That they try to grab the stressors that they may be faced with, and do not ask for help.”
Such fears are shared in the North Thurston Public Schools in Washington State, where most of the 14,000 students didn’t step foot in a school building for nearly a year. The lack of on site schooling has made it daunting for district mental health and social services staff to reach children needing help. The district has 11 mental health specialists who provide one-on-one counseling and social services to students and their families.
“When we had students in person, it was much easier” to monitor the kids, said Mandy Garrison, a licensed clinical social worker who is one of the specialists. With schools closed, she said, several “typically well functioning” pupils suddenly began “struggling with the social isolation, anxiety, fear of the future and depression.”
The district has struggled to locate some of the hundreds of students who have disappeared from school despite repeated attempts to contact those families by phone, email or with home visits. Since the beginning of the pandemic, overall district enrollment fell from 14,800 in March 2020 to less than 13,990 in March 2021.
“They are disappearing,” said Leslie Van Leishout, director of student support. “We can't help them or their mental health needs if we can't find them.”
URGING STUDENTS BACK
In the Somerset Independent School District south of San Antonio, Texas, schools reopened in September. Still, one-in-five students in a district primarily serving minority children have opted for virtual education, said Superintendent Saul Hinojosa.
The district has seen the number of suicide assessments double this school year; when staff learn of a student exhibiting potentially suicidal behaviors, they typically alert a team of mental health professionals to assess the child. Absenteeism and disengagement increased “exponentially” and mental health referrals doubled, Hinojosa said. These increases are concentrated among the students studying virtually, 75% of whom are failing, the district said.
The district is urging students to come back. “We’re having these conversations with parents and telling them it’s OK to bring them to school, it’s safe,” Hinojosa said.
Aided by Community Labs, a San Antonio nonprofit, the district launched a $2 million program to test some 85% of its 2,166 staff and students weekly for COVID. About half a percent tested positive each week. The 10 or fewer who did likely became infected outside school, the district said.
Some parents remain uncomfortable sending their children back to school, and they say for good reason.
Mary Villanueva, whose husband has diabetes and lung damage from a previous bout of pneumonia, said the risk still seems too high. She has kept her 14-year-old daughter and 7-year-old twin grandchildren home since last March. She said they were generally coping well, though the pandemic has exacerbated her grandson’s anxiety issues. “He won’t wear a mask. He gets claustrophobic and will have an anxiety attack,” she said.
Terry White, an American history teacher at Somerset High, kept his freshman son in virtual education this fall because his wife suffers from an autoimmune disease that puts her at high risk from COVID-19. After missing football and months without interaction outside home, their son lost interest in classes and became withdrawn.
After several weeks of testing and contact tracing showed COVID was not spreading in schools, the Whites sent him back to class. “We have our old son back, laughing and joking,” White said.
Long before COVID, the Modoc Joint Unified School District in northeastern California struggled with a faltering economy, substance abuse and child neglect, said superintendent Tom O'Malley, a life-long resident.
Then the schools closed. When they did, Modoc’s Child Protective Services unit saw a 30% decrease in child abuse reports.
O’Malley worried about abuse happening behind closed doors. A month after school started in September, students started to open up to staff about emotional, physical or sexual abuse they reported experiencing during the lockdown.
In a three-week span last fall, the staff intervened in 12 cases of potentially suicidal students, up from the one to two students they normally see in a year. In each case, school staff assessed whether they needed to contact police or find other resources to help the families with food, clothing or medical and mental health care.
“We were overwhelmed,” O’Malley said.
Without the regular oversight from school and with parents working or grappling with their own anxieties, many students are on their own. That can be a recipe for trouble.
Since classes went virtual last year, Jayme Banks, deputy chief of prevention, intervention and trauma at the Philadelphia Public School District, has received a report almost every week from police about students, including shootings, car accidents and arrests. Fatal youth shootings in the city rose from 55 in 2019 to 87 in 2020, and nonfatal shootings increased 72% over the previous four year average, from 309 to 534, according to data from the Philadelphia Office of the Comptroller. Were the students in schools, some educators believe, fewer cases would occur.
With each situation, the district works with teachers and counselors to help the student get back on track in classes and find therapy and community programs.
Helping students navigate such traumatic experiences can weigh on teachers. “It’s a heavy lift,” Banks said.
For others, the daily struggle of virtual education and working with students who are slipping away becomes too much.
Banks’ staff is reaching out to educators who seem overwhelmed and helping them connect with therapists and other support systems. In one case, Banks said, she and her team intervened to help a teacher thought by colleagues to be suicidal.
SHORT TERM, LONG TERM
At the dawn of the pandemic, school closings initially received little pushback; parents assumed the shutdowns would last a few short weeks. A full year later, some parents are becoming increasingly vocal.
Siva Raj, a single father of two boys in San Francisco, is co-leading a campaign to recall the district’s school board. His older son, 14, has lost all motivation to learn, he said, and often just goes between his bed and computer and back.
“It’s been shattering to see that,” Raj said. “I feel like I am failing him.”
When children do return to the classroom, some parents say they see a change.
In San Francisco, as her children struggled with remote learning, Sullivan Morgan and her husband pored over their finances. They saw there was no way they could afford private schools, which offered in-person teaching, for both boys.
In the fall, they decided to sell their house and move to Austin, where their sons could attend public school. Since January, both sons have been back in school five days a week. Her oldest is playing piano again.

“They are back to their old selves,” the mother said.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The beaches of Brazilian city Rio de Janeiro will be closed this weekend, according to a municipal decree enacted on Friday, as the local government seeks to stem the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The measures take effect at midnight on Friday, forbidding all activities from sports to sunbathing and swimming. They are valid through Monday. 
Even with a rising number of infections and deaths in Brazil's second-largest city, residents have flocked to the breaches, especially on sunny weekends. The state government closed them last year, but the measure was soon lifted. 
Parking vehicles along the shore is also prohibited under the decree, and authorities are expected to raise barriers to block tour buses.
Rio de Janeiro's hospitals reached 95% capacity on Thursday, as patients' admissions to intensive care units soared over the past few days.
Rio de Janeiro has registered almost 217,000 cases of COVID-19 and nearly 20,000 deaths related to the virus. More 287,000 people have died throughout Brazil.

An estimated half a million people have been vaccinated in Rio de Janeiro, or 7.4% of the population, government data show, higher than the national average.

Russia scientists take samples,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian scientists are trying to understand the scale of a potential threat to the environment in Siberia: snow polluted with microplastics that then melts and seeps into the ground.
Scientists at Tomsk State University (TSU) say they have gathered snow samples from 20 different Siberian regions - from the Altai mountains to the Arctic - and that their preliminary findings confirm that airborne plastic fibres are turning up in snow in remote parts of the wilderness.
""It's clear that it's not just rivers and seas that are involved circulating microplastics around the world, but also soil, living creatures and even the atmosphere,"" Yulia Frank, scientific director at TSU's Microplastics Siberia centre, told Reuters.
Microplastics, which are created when bigger pieces of plastic litter break up over time, are increasingly being found in the air, food, drinking water and even Arctic ice. Scientists are increasingly worried they may pose a risk to human health and marine life, though there is no consensus yet on the issue. 
Tomsk scientists have previously found microplastics in the digestive systems of fish caught in Siberian rivers, confirming that they are contributing to polluting the Arctic Ocean with plastic.
""Siberia is absolutely under-researched in this aspect and our (Russia's) interest in this problem comes late compared to the rest of the world,"" Frank said. 

Scientists are now studying the snow samples to understand to what degree population density, the proximity of roads and other human activity contributes to the pollution.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - China is bolstering its ability to attack and blockade Taiwan, deploying long-range missiles to prevent foreign forces helping in the event of war and using psychological warfare to undermine faith in Taiwan's military, the island's defence ministry said.
The ministry, in its once-every-four-years defence review, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, warned China was deploying ""grey zone"" warfare tactics to subdue the Chinese-claimed island, seeking to wear Taiwan down with repeated drills and activities near its airspace and waters. 
""China has continued to modernise its military and increase its capability in a war with Taiwan,"" it said.
China's Defence Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. 
China views democratic Taiwan as its own territory, and has ramped up military activities in recent months, seeking to assert its sovereignty and express displeasure at Washington's support for the island.
The review offered sobering details about the threat Taiwan faces from the world's largest armed forces.
It said China was building copies of Taiwanese facilities so it could train to attack them and was conducting landing drills to simulate invading Taiwan.
China has the ability to partially shut down Taiwan's key ports and sea routes and cut off sea transport to the island, while its deployment of long-distance missiles is aimed at stopping foreign forces from assisting Taiwan, it said.
China's ""hostility and threats against us have increased, elevating the risks of an accident and conflict and destroying stability and peace across the Taiwan Strait,"" the report said.
Chinese aircraft, including drones, are flying repeatedly in Taiwan's air defence identification zone, seeking to wear out Taiwan's air force, it added.
China is also spreading ""fake news"" in Taiwan to try and ""damage people's faith in the country"", the report said.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said earlier this month that China would resolutely deter any separatist activity seeking Taiwan's independence.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name, and that she will defend its democracy and sovereignty.
Tsai is overseeing a military modernisation programme, including building submarines, upgrading Taiwan's air force, and developing long-range missiles of its own.
But its armed forces are dwarfed by China's which is adding stealth jets, aircraft carriers and other advanced equipment.
Taiwan is a key source of tension between Beijing and Washington, the island's main arms supplier and international backer, and was raised in high-level Sino-U.S. talks in Alaska on Thursday.

U.S. President Joe Biden's government, which took office on Jan. 20, has moved to reassure Taiwan that its commitment to them is ""rock solid"", especially after China stepped up its military activity near the island shortly after Biden's inauguration.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's pro-business Free Democrats, emerging as a pivotal force ahead of September elections, worry that declining support for Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats could scupper their chances of joining up to keep the centre-right in power.
An internal Free Democrats (FDP) analysis reveals that the party privately considers the CDU's slide in two state elections last weekend as a potential ""catastrophe"" for the centre-right camp, even as the FDP publicly celebrates its own resurgence.
The document, obtained by Reuters, describes Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), as a ""powder keg"" ready to explode over their handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
The CDU/CSU alliance, known as the Union, benefited early in the pandemic from a ""rally round the flag"" effect, the FDP said, as voters backed Merkel in a time of crisis. A ""halo"" effect saw her popularity spread across her party, but this had evaporated.
""Confidence in good governance has been met with serious management failures in government,"" the FDP document read, citing problems with the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, test kits and bridging grants.
The report is significant because the FDP, which is led by the 42-year-old Christian Lindner and has been emboldened by gains in a regional vote last Sunday, are potential kingmakers in a national government after September's federal elections.
LEFT-WING COALITION?
The CDU slumped to record defeats in two state votes on Sunday after its muddled pandemic response, setting back its prospects at the federal elections, which they will face without Merkel, who is standing down after holding power since 2005.
The CDU's slump gives the FDP no grounds for celebration, the analysis read, as it opens up the risk of a left-wing coalition of the ecologist Greens, the Social Democrats (SPD) and the far-left Linke taking power after the September vote.
""This would be a political catastrophe in view of the challenges facing Germany,"" the analysis said. 
The FDP has been strongly critical of the ruling CDU/CSU alliance over its handling of the pandemic and for what it says is a violation of civil liberties from lockdown measures.
In the southwestern automotive hub of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the FDP increased its share of the vote in Sunday's state election to 10.5% from 8.3% in the previous poll in 2016.
The gains opened the way for a potential regional alliance of the Greens, SPD and FDP, dubbed a 'traffic light' coalition after the parties' colours. Before Sunday's vote, the Greens had ruled in coalition with Merkel's party.
Agreement on a traffic light coalition in Baden-Wuerttemberg would bolster the chances of the same parties seeking a national coalition in September, a scenario that would cast Merkel's conservatives into opposition for the first time since 2005.
The FDP would not be drawn earlier this week on its potential as kingmaker in a national government.
The CDU/CSU would like to join forces with the FDP, though polls show that such a combination would now lack sufficient voter support to form a government.
Another option would be a three-way alliance of the CDU/CSU, Greens and FDP, though the FDP walked away from coalition talks over that formation after the 2017 federal election.
In its analysis, the FDP called for more transparency in politics after a scandal emerged over face mask procurement deals involving CDU/CSU lawmakers.

The Union's decline risks ""a political vacuum, into which destructive forces take root,"" it said.

Reuters reported on Thursday that the EU froze plans to blacklist more senior executives at Turkey's state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO), in the clearest sign that Ankara's diplomatic offensive this year is bearing fruit after months of tensions with the bloc.

Speaking to reporters in Istanbul, Erdogan said he would also discuss Turkey's expectations from the bloc as a NATO ally, including Ankara's demands for visa-free travel, an update to a customs union, and the possibility of EU sanctions, which the bloc had threatened at its last summit in December.

AMSTERDAM/LONDON (Reuters) - Nearly a dozen countries resumed use of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 shots on Friday as EU and British regulators said the benefits outweighed any risks after reports of rare instances of blood clotting that temporarily halted inoculations. 
The end of suspensions will kick off a test of public confidence, both in the shot and in drug regulators whose conclusions are under unprecedented scrutiny, as virus variants spread and the global death toll, now at nearly 2.7 million, rises.
Indonesia joined Germany, France and others in re-administering the shots after they suspended vaccinations on reports of around 30 cases of rare brain blood clots, after millions of injections, that sent scientists and governments scrambling to determine if there was a link.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) came to what it called a clear conclusion that the vaccine's benefits in protecting people from coronavirus-related death or hospitalisation outweighed the possible risks.
Still, EMA said a link between rare events of blood clots in the brain and the shot could not be definitively ruled out and that it will continue its scrutiny, along with the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
""This is a safe and effective vaccine,"" EMA director Emer Cooke told a briefing on Thursday. ""If it were me, I would be vaccinated tomorrow.""
The EMA said it would update its guidance on the vaccine to include an explanation for patients about the potential risks and information for healthcare professionals, to help people recognise instances when they may need to seek medical assistance following a vaccination.
After the EMA move, others also sought to reinforce confidence in AstraZeneca's vaccine, which is seen globally as an important asset due to its relatively easy storage and transport requirements and inexpensive price, compared to mRNA vaccines made by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
""What we really should be focusing on is that this is incredibly reassuring. The processes are working, the safety monitoring that we all expect from our authorities is happening,"" Andrew Pollard, who runs the Oxford Vaccine Group, told BBC radio, after both regulators said vaccinations could continue after reports of blood clots.
""We do need to continue to monitor safety, but in the end it's the virus we're fighting, not the vaccines.""
Oxford University is partnered with AstraZeneca on the vaccine.
Germany resumed administering the AstraZeneca vaccine from Friday morning, while French Prime Minister Jean Castex said he would seek to promote a similar resumption in his country by getting the shot himself on Friday.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said Italy would follow suit, echoing sentiments from Cyprus, Latvia and Lithuania.
Spain will resume inoculations from Wednesday. Canada also gave its backing to the vaccine.
Britain's MHRA is investigating five cases of the rare brain blood clot that had been reported out of 11 million shots administered in the UK.
It said it would investigate reports of clots in the cerebral veins (sinus vein thrombosis, or CSVT) occurring together with lowered platelets soon after vaccination. But the agency said use of the vaccine should continue and one official said Britain's rollout would likely not stop even if a link was proved.
The drugmaker's own review covering more than 17 million people who have received its shot in the EU and Britain found no evidence of increased risk of blood clots.

The World Health Organization, which this week also reaffirmed its support for the shot that remains a centrepiece of its COVAX vaccine sharing programme, plans on Friday to give an update on its vaccine advisory committee's own review.

314,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 07:15AM ET</span>",Factbox: Sanctions imposed against Myanmar’s generals since they seized power,"By Simon Lewis
(Reuters) - World leaders from Washington to Singapore have condemned a military coup in Myanmar, urging generals to halt a deadly crackdown on demonstrators, release detainees including civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and restore the elected government.
Some countries have followed up with targeted financial sanctions in hopes of putting the squeeze on the generals who staged the Feb. 1 coup and convince them to change course.
With the European Union set to approve sanctions on Myanmar next week, here is a snapshot of other actions around the globe.
UNITED STATES
President Joe Biden condemned the coup and issued an executive order on Feb. 11 that paved the way for new sanctions against the Myanmar military and its interests. The order froze about $1 billion in reserves Myanmar's central bank was holding at the New York Fed, which the junta had attempted to withdraw after seizing power.
Some Myanmar generals, including Commander in Chief Min Aung Hlaing, were already under U.S. human rights sanctions over their role in a bloody campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority that sparked a refugee crisis in 2017. 
U.S. Treasury sanctions last month targeted 14 Myanmar officers involved in the coup, along with some military companies involved in the gemstone industry, freezing any U.S. assets they hold and barring Americans from dealing with them. Min Aung Hlaing’s children and companies they control were later hit with the same sanctions.
Four military-controlled ministries and conglomerates were placed under sanctions by the U.S. Commerce Department on March 4. Those measures require U.S. suppliers to seek difficult-to-obtain licences to export goods to the ministries of defence and home affairs, and to military conglomerates Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited and Myanmar Economic Corporation.
EUROPEAN UNION
The European Union is set to impose sanctions on Myanmar's armed forces to target businesses they run. They will be agreed by EU foreign ministers on Monday.
Sanctions would target companies ""generating revenue for, or providing financial support to, the Myanmar Armed Forces"", according to documents seen by Reuters. The bloc sought to avoid measures that would harm ordinary people. 
While the bloc has an arms embargo on Myanmar, and has targeted some senior military officials since 2018, the measures would be its most significant response since the coup.
UNITED NATIONS
Action against the junta from the international body has been stifled by Russia and China, which hold vetoes over the U.N. Security Council votes needed to impose U.N. sanctions or arms embargoes. 
The two countries shielded Myanmar from any strong council action over the 2017 Rohingya crisis and argue that Myanmar’s political situation is an internal matter.
The 15-member Security Council has issued two statements expressing concern and condemning violence against protesters, but dropped language condemning the army takeover as a coup and threatening possible further action due to opposition by China, Russia, India and Vietnam.
Negotiations on the statements - issued in February and March - signalled that the council could struggle to do much more on Myanmar. 
OTHER NATIONS
New Zealand announced a week after the coup that it was suspending high-level contacts with Myanmar and imposing a travel ban on military leaders.
Britain and Canada imposed their own sanctions on Feb. 13. Britain said it would impose asset freezes and travel bans on three generals while Canada blacklisted nine military officials. Britain has also taken measures to prevent British aid indirectly helping the junta.
Australia on March 7 said it was suspending its limited cooperation with the Myanmar military and would redirect aid bound for the government to aid groups. 

Aside from sanctions, some overseas firms and investors who had business links with Myanmar's military, like Japan's Kirin Holdings Co, have cut those ties.

315,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>",Team player Hassan succeeds Tanzania's blunt-spoken Magufuli,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Tanzania's first woman president, the calm, measured Samia Suluhu Hassan, brings a striking change of leadership style as successor to John Magufuli, a brash populist who drew global attention by playing down the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Hassan, sworn in on Friday, is regarded as a consensus-builder, a trait that may prove an asset in dealing with the various factions within the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party and security agencies following the announcement of Magufuli's death.
""I don't speak in a forceful voice, like others,"" she told a BBC Swahili interview last year. 
""But to speak with someone in a way that they understand you, it's not necessary to shout. I can speak to you, in a soft tone, but make it clear that you understand what I mean.""
She is the first Tanzanian president born on the occasionally restive autonomous Zanzibar archipelago, rather than the African mainland which has dominated Tanzania since the state was formed as a union of the two territories in 1964.
At her inauguration she urged Tanzanians to look forward with hope, a remark apparently aimed at dispelling a mood of uncertainty arising from Magufuli's disappearance from public view for 18 days before his death was announced.
As a softly spoken woman and a Muslim from the islands, her personal contrast with the barnstorming Christian from the interior was one of the reasons CCM leaders picked Hassan as Magufuli's running mate in 2015, a party insider told Reuters.
'CALM AND COMPETENT'
Elsie Eyakuze, a Dar es Salaam-based columnist and blogger, said Hassan projected assurance and calm at her inauguration.
""We sense her gravitas, appreciate her intellect. We look forward to her calm and competent approach to politics. This is really big for women,” she told Reuters.
""She adopted a conciliatory tone that was not too soft and not too hard. I think she brought a certain calm that we have all been hoping for.” 
In her six years serving as Magufuli's deputy, at times she appeared to publicly embrace the unorthodox and increasingly authoritarian style of a leader nicknamed ""the Bulldozer"". She emulated his habit of making surprise visits to government offices to check that civil servants were working.
But although she toed Magufuli's line publicly, a Tanzanian politician who knows her said that privately she was uneasy about the country's direction and felt sidelined by the camp that surrounded him. 
""I'm sure there will be a lot of changes under her leadership,"" the politician said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
There was no immediate reply from her office to a Reuters request for comment.
As head of state and government, Hassan will have to grapple with the health impact of a COVID-19 pandemic that her predecessor long denied, as well as its economic consequences.
She also faces the task of bringing together a country polarised during the Magufuli years. That would require building a political base of her own within the CCM, analysts say.
""She presents herself very diplomatically. We haven’t seen her yelling at people in public or firing people in public. But she is a very shrewd politician,"" said Aikande Kwayu, Honorary Research Fellow at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the United States.
'SHE CANNOT BE LIKE HIM'
Hassan, 61, rose through the ranks of the CCM after winning a seat in 2000 as a lawmaker in Zanzibar's regional legislature. She held posts in the archipelago's autonomous cabinet, before winning a seat in Tanzania's national assembly in 2010.
Then-president Jakaya Kikwete named her state minister for union affairs, in charge of relations between the central government and Zanzibar. She was appointed vice chair of an assembly charged with writing a new constitution, an effort that stalled amid tension between Zanzibar and the mainland.
Fatma Karume, a lawyer who has been a critic of Magufuli in the past, said Hassan would be a contrast to her predecessor, regarded by opponents as intolerant.

""She cannot be like him. She is a woman, she is Zanzibari, she is a Muslim. ... She projects a more conciliatory tone, a kinder tone,"" said Karume. ""She comes from a very small island, where if you treat people badly you are going to meet them at funerals. It's a completely different social upbringing.""

Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, who have backed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline opposed by the United States, are leading in polls ahead of September elections and are seen as most likely to seek a coalition with the ecologist Greens that are forecast to come second.
Armin Laschet, leader of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), has downplayed concerns of the United States and eastern European countries, such as Poland, that say the pipeline increases Europe's dependence on Russian gas.
In common with the United States, which has imposed sanctions on some entities involved in the Gazprom-led project, the Greens say it entrenches the wrong response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its arming of separatists in east Ukraine.
""The pipeline project Nord Stream 2 is not only a political project because of its climate and energy implications but also because it causes damage on the geopolitical level - especially given the situation in Ukraine - and therefore it should be stopped,"" read the programme, adding that Russia was increasingly becoming an ""authoritarian state"".
The $11 billion project will bypass Western ally Ukraine, potentially depriving it of valuable transit fees. It will also compete with shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday warned entities involved in Nord Stream 2 to quit.

A poll by the Forsa research institute this week put the Greens on 21%, behind the conservatives whose share has fallen to 29% over a sluggish vaccine rollout, a corruption scandal linked to face mask deals and growing frustration at the lack of a clear path out of the pandemic and lockdowns to contain it.

Diplomatic ties sank to a new low this week after U.S. President Joe Biden said he thought President Vladimir Putin was ""a killer"" in an interview that prompted Russia to recall its ambassador to the United States. Putin later offered Biden live online talks in the coming days.
On Friday, the Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Putin's offer of talks remained open and that Putin could do any time that was convenient for Biden, though the offer would not stay on the table indefinitely. 
""Putin said that despite everything there's no point in playing at megaphone diplomacy and trading barbs. There is a point in continuing relations,"" Peskov told reporters on a conference call. 
He was asked about a new Cold War between the two countries. 
""We, of course, always hope for the best, but are always ready for the worst. As far as Russia is concerned, President Putin has clearly stated his desire to continue ties...,"" he said.
""But of course, we can't not take into account Biden's comments,"" he said, in a reference to Biden's interview with ABC News broadcast on Wednesday. 
In it, Biden said ""I do"" when asked if he believed Putin was a killer, prompting Putin to cite a Russian children's playground chant in response saying ""he who said it, did it"". 

Biden also described Putin as having no soul in the interview, and said the Russian leader would pay a price for alleged meddling in the November 2020 U.S. presidential election, something the Kremlin denies.

North Korea earlier announced it would sever diplomatic relations with Malaysia after a court there ruled that a North Korean man could be extradited to the United States to face money-laundering charges, state media KCNA reported on Friday.

319,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>",Lockdown extension looms in Germany as COVID case numbers rise,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German health minister Jens Spahn on Friday dampened hopes that further coronavirus restrictions will be lifted soon, saying rising infections could mean that curbs to slow the spread of the virus may have to be re-imposed.
""The rising case numbers may mean that we cannot take further opening steps in the weeks to come. On the contrary, we may even have to take steps backwards,"" Spahn told a weekly news conference.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to meet with leaders of Germany's 16 federal states on Monday to discuss whether to extend a lockdown that has been in place since mid-December.
Earlier this month, the group had laid out plans for a gradual re-opening of the economy, and many shops have since been opened for appointment-only shopping.
But coronavirus infections numbers have been on the rise in recent weeks. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 17,482 to 2,629,750, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Friday. The reported death toll rose by 226 to 74,358.
The number of infections per 100,000 people over seven days rose to 96, up from 72 a week ago and from 65 on March 4, when Merkel and the state premiers laid out their re-opening plan.
Lars Schaade, vice-president of the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases, on Friday urged people not to travel over the Easter holiday period as case numbers were rising exponentially.
There was a risk that Germany could be in a similar situation by Easter as it was in at Christmas, he said.
The 7-day incidence reached a high near 200 in late December, soon after Germany went from a ""lockdown lite"" that started in early November, during which schools and stores were open, to a full shutdown. 

The incidence rate decreased following the shutdown but is back at 96 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people, according to RKI data.

Wearing a red hijab, she took her oath of office on the Koran in a ceremony at State House in the counry's commercial capital Dar es Salaam. She is the first female head of state in the country of 58 million. 
Hassan, vice president since 2015, gave a brief and sombre address after she was sworn in, addressing a heavily male crowd that included two former presidents and uniformed officers. 
""This is a time to bury our differences, and be one as a nation,"" she said. ""This is not a time for finger pointing, but it is a time to hold hands and move forward together.""
The remarks appeared aimed at dispelling a mood of uncertainty that developed after Magufuli, criticised by opponents as a divisive and authoritarian figure, disappeared from public view for 18 days before his death was announced.
His absence from public life drew speculation he was critically ill with COVID-19. Magufuli died of heart disease, Hassan said when announcing his death on Wedneday.
Among the first tasks facing Hassan, 61, will be a decision on whether to procure COVID-19 vaccines. Under her predecessor, the government said it would not obtain any vaccines until the country's own experts had reviewed them.
She will also be faced with the task of healing a country polarized during the Magufuli years, analysts said, and building her own political base to govern effectively. 
'MY MENTOR'
Described as a soft-spoken consensus-builder, Hassan will also be the country's first president born in Zanzibar, the archipelago that forms part of the union of the Republic of Tanzania.
Her leadership style is seen as a potential contrast from Magufuli, a brash populist who earned the nickname 'Bulldozer' for muscling through policies and who drew criticism for his intolerance of dissent, which his government denied.
She praised the late leader in her remarks: ""He taught me a lot, he was my mentor and prepared me sufficiently.""
Rights groups say Magufuli's six-year-rule was marred by arbitrary arrests, suspension of critical television and radio stations and the blocking of social media and other abuses.
New York-based Human Rights Watch said Tanzania now had a chance to revive its democracy and reverse the country's ""downward human rights trajectory"" under Magufuli.

DaMina Advisors, a political risk advisory firm, predicted the new president was likely to make a public U-turn on her predecessor's policy of COVID-19 denial and his generally negative attitudes toward foreign investors.

The United States, Russia, China and Pakistan called on Afghanistan's warring sides to reach an immediate ceasefire at the conference, held in Russia just six weeks before a deadline agreed last year to withdraw U.S. troops.
""We expressed our readiness to accelerate the (peace) process,"" Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of Afghanistan's High Council for National Reconciliation, told Russia's RIA news agency. ""They (the Taliban) did as well.""
Abdullah said the sides had not discussed any specific issues when they met in Moscow on Friday. 
Moscow hosted the international conference on Afghanistan on Thursday, at which Russia, the United States, China and Pakistan released a joint statement calling on the Afghan sides to reach a peace deal and curb violence, and on the Taliban not to launch any offensives in the spring and summer. 
The conference aimed to reinvigorate negotiations which have been taking place between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Qatar's capital Doha, largely stalled over government accusations that the insurgents have failed to halt violence.

The Moscow conference was the first time the United States had sent a senior representative to talks on Afghanistan under a format launched by Russia in 2017. Washington agreed last year with the Taliban to withdraw its troops by May 1 after nearly two decades, and is looking for support among regional powers for its plans for the peace process.

The Songkran festival takes place from April 13 to 15 and in a normal year crowds pack the streets, spraying water guns or flinging water from pick-up trucks in what has been described as the world's biggest water fight. 
""Water splashing will not happen this Songkran. We must ask you to cooperate with us,"" Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for Thailand's COVID-19 taskforce, told a briefing. 
He said foam parties would also be banned, though a tradition of pouring water over the hands of older people, religious activities and travel between provinces to visit relatives would be allowed. 
Thailand has been relatively successful in controlling coronavirus infections, with a new wave of infections in the first two months of the year now levelling off and after recording 88 deaths.
But the country's strict border controls have decimated its vital tourism industry, with revenues dropping over 80% as visitor numbers plunged from 40 million visitors in 2019 to 6.7 million last year. 
A global vaccine rollout has given hope that tourism can be revived and Taweesin gave more details on Friday on a plan to relax strict quarantine rules starting April 1. 
Mandatory quarantine would be cut from 14 to 10 days for general arrivals and halved for those who were vaccinated, he said. 
Unvaccinated foreigners will still be required to show a negative COVID-19 test result, while Thai citizens will no longer need to do so. 
To qualify for the vaccinated group, all visitors must get a shot within three months of travel and present a certificate as proof. 

Taweesin added that those traveling from countries where there are COVID-19 mutations will still need to undergo quarantine for 14 days.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - The first high-level U.S.-China talks of the Biden administration got off to a fiery start on Thursday, with both sides leveling sharp rebukes of the others' policies in a rare public display that underscored the level of bilateral tension.
The run-up to the meeting in Anchorage, Alaska, which followed visits by U.S. officials to allies Japan and South Korea, was marked by a flurry of moves by Washington that showed it was taking a tough stance, and blunt talk from Beijing.
""We will ... discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion of our allies,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his Chinese counterparts in highly unusual extended back-and-forth in front of cameras.
""Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability,"" he said. 
The Biden administration has made clear that it is looking for a change in behavior from China, which has expressed hope to reset relations that had worsened drastically under former President Donald Trump.
China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi responded with a 15-minute speech in Chinese while the U.S. side awaited translation, lashing out about what he said was the United States' struggling democracy, poor treatment of minorities, and criticizing its foreign and trade policies. 
""The United States uses its military force and financial hegemony to carry out long arm jurisdiction and suppress other countries,"" said Yang.
""It abuses so-called notions of national security to obstruct normal trade exchanges, and incite some countries to attack China,"" he added.
'GRANDSTANDING' AND PROTOCOL BREACHES
Throughout Yang's monologue, U.S. National Security Adviser Sullivan and other officials in the delegation passed notes to each other. At the end, Blinken held journalists in the room so he could respond.
What is typically a few minutes of opening remarks in front of journalists for such high-level meetings lasted for more than an hour, and the two delegations tussled about when media would be ushered out of the room. 
Afterwards, the United States accused China of ""grandstanding"" while Chinese state media blamed U.S. officials for speaking too long and being ""inhospitable"". 
Both sides accused the other of violating diplomatic protocol, with a U.S. official saying the two had initially agreed two minutes of opening statements by each of the principals. 
""The Chinese delegation ... seems to have arrived intent on grandstanding, focused on public theatrics and dramatics over substance,"" the official told reporters at the Anchorage hotel where the meeting was taking place.
""Exaggerated diplomatic presentations often are aimed at a domestic audience,"" the official added.
Many netizens on China's social media said Chinese officials were doing a good job in Alaska, and that the U.S. side had shown zero sincerity.
Some even characterized the talks as a ""Hongmen Banquet"", a historical event that took place 2,000 years ago where a rebel leader invited another to a feast with the intention of murdering him.
Still, the two sides reconvened for another meeting on Thursday evening, and a senior Biden administration official said that the first session was ""substantive, serious, and direct,"" running well beyond the two hours originally allotted. 
""We used the session, just as we had planned, to outline our interests and priorities, and we heard the same from our Chinese counterparts,"" the official said in the pool report, adding that a third session of talks was scheduled for Friday morning.
While much of Biden's China policy is still being formulated, including how to handle the tariffs on Chinese goods implemented under Trump, his administration has so far placed a stronger emphasis on democratic values and allegations of human rights abuses by China.
China firmly opposes U.S. interference in what it regards as its internal affairs, issues such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said it was expecting the United States to brief them about the talks.
TERMS OF DISAGREEMENT
Washington says Blinken's Asia tour before the meeting with Chinese officials, as well as U.S. outreach to Europe, India and other partners, shows how the United States has strengthened its hand to confront China since Biden took office in January.
But the two sides appeared primed to agree on very little at the talks.
Even the status of the meeting became a sticking point, with China insisting it is a ""strategic dialogue"", harkening back to bilateral mechanisms of years past. The U.S. side rejected that, calling it a one-off session. 
On the eve of the talks, the United States issued a flurry of actions directed at China, including a move to begin revoking Chinese telecoms licenses, subpoenas to multiple Chinese information technology companies over national security concerns, and updated sanctions on China over a rollback of democracy in Hong Kong.
Adding to tensions, China on Friday tried a Canadian citizen on espionage charges, in a case embroiled in a wider diplomatic spat between Washington and Beijing.
At the talks on Thursday, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi questioned Blinken about whether the sanctions were announced ahead of the meeting on purpose.
Washington has said it is willing to work with China when it is in U.S. interests, citing climate policy and the coronavirus pandemic as examples. Blinken said Washington hoped to see China use its influence with North Korea to persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons.
Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said tough statements from both sides in the run-up to the meeting had created a risk that it would devolve into an exchange of accusations and demands. 

""Neither side benefits from this meeting being judged a total failure,"" Glaser said.

Spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi was quoted by local media as saying the cold testing, which usually include the initial startup of fluid systems and support systems, will take place early in the Iranian new year that begins this Sunday.
""In other words, we have advanced work in the field of fuel, storage, etc,"" Kamalvandi said.
Iran has recently accelerated its breaches of the 2015 international nuclear deal in an apparent bid to pressure U.S. President Joe Biden to reverse his predecessor’s abandonment of the agreement. Both sides are locked in a standoff over who should move first to save the deal.
Iran agreed to shut down the reactor at Arak - about 250 km (155 miles) southwest of Tehran - under the 2015 deal. It was allowed to produce a limited amount of heavy water and Tehran has been working on redesigning the reactor. It says it plans to make isotopes for medical and agricultural use.
The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a report to member states earlier this week that Iran has started enriching uranium at its underground Natanz plant with a second type of advanced centrifuge, the IR-4, in a further breach of the deal.
Last year Iran started moving three cascades, or clusters, of different advanced models of centrifuge from an above-ground plant at Natanz to its below-ground Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP). It is already enriching underground with IR-2m centrifuges. The deal only lets it enrich there with first-generation IR-1 machines.

Iran is enriching up to 20% purity at another plant, Fordow.

BRAZZAVILLE (Reuters) - Congo Republic President Denis Sassou Nguesso looks set to prolong his decades-long rule in an election on Sunday in which he has pledged to revive the flagging economy. 
Sassou, a 77-year old former paratrooper, rose to power in the oil-producing country on the western coast of central Africa in a military coup in 1979. He lost Congo's first multi-party elections in 1992 but regained power in 1997 after a civil war and has now ruled for a combined total of almost 37 years. 
Sassou will face six opposition candidates in an election whose run-up has been tightly controlled by his government and drawn criticism from the influential Catholic Church and rights activists. 
Known as 'emperor' by some of his African peers because of his longevity and role as a regional elder statesman, Sassou has said he will use all his experience to revive the debt-ridden economy if he wins another five years in power. 
An 8% fall in gross domestic product (GDP) last year was due to the impact of COVID-19 and a collapse in world oil prices, but GDP is expected to grow by less than 1% this year.
""The people need men with experience, and I'm putting all my experience in service of the youths of our country,"" he said on the campaign trail. 
His main challenger is Guy-Brice Parfait Kolelas, a former minister who was second in the last, disputed election in 2016 with 15% of votes. The candidates who came third and fifth were later arrested and convicted of illegally possessing weapons. 
Kolelas promised to bring change and tackle endemic corruption, but political analysts say he stands little chance against Sassou whose loyalists control all big institutions. 
""The opposition appears in an even weaker state than when it failed to unseat the president back in 2016,"" said Maja Bovcon, senior Africa analyst at risk consultancy Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK) Maplecroft.
If no candidate wins more than 50% of the votes, the top two will face a run-off. 
'NO SUSPENSE' 
The Catholic Church has raised concerns about the fairness of the vote after the interior ministry rejected its request to deploy over 1,000 election observers. 
""The church has some reservations about the organisation of the election,"" said Felicien Mavoungou, coordinator of the church's Justice and Peace Commission. ""We are surprised by the government's refusal to grant us permission as observers."" 
Retired engineer Stephane Ngampo is among voters who want change but doubt it will come. 
""Even if he is given more years, the country will not come out of the water,"" he said.
Ignongui Silla, wearing a matching dress and headscarf showing Sassou's face, is voting for the president.
""It's better to choose old shoes that you're comfortable in. When you wear new ones they hurt and you can't go far,"" she said.
Unlike in 2016, when there was unrest after Sassou was declared the winner, little violence is expected in the country of 5.4 million. 
But the economic crisis, which began with a 2014 slump in oil prices, and the government's mountain of debt, much of it owed to oil traders such as Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) and Trafigura, pose big challenges.. 
Drawn-out negotiations over restructuring those debts has delayed implementation of a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed in 2019. 

The IMF said in February that Congo's debt remained unsustainable, although it was expected to fall below 100% of GDP this year.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron met with top officials on Jan. 29 and revealed a surprise: despite the urgings of some senior ministers and independent scientists, he would try to steer the country out of the pandemic without locking it down again.
His gamble was that if France could avoid a third large-scale lockdown, he could give the economy a chance to recover from a deep slowdown that, some in his circle felt, could soon replace the virus as the biggest challenge of his presidency.
But the tactic is beginning to unravel, with intensive care units in some parts of France on the verge of overflowing with COVID-19 patients, coronavirus cases surging and his government announcing a new round of tougher restrictions on Thursday.
    Interviews with six people close to Macron's administration show how the French leader, having arrived at the decision to avoid another lockdown, came under intensifying pressure to change course as the toll from the virus rose again.
In a meeting with Prime Minister Jean Castex on Monday, Stanislas Guerini, head of the pro-Macron faction in parliament, said the effort to avoid a lockdown was starting to look like ""obstinacy"", according to a parliamentary source close to Macron who was present.
    The presidential administration did not respond to a request for comment on the reasons behind Macron's choices over COVID-19 restrictions. Two aides, speaking anonymously, said they still believed Macron had chosen the right course.
Macron's decision to focus on economic challenges was not unique. Some European leaders have plotted a similar course, while others opted for tougher restrictions in the hope of reaping the financial rewards later.
The final bill for the coronavirus crisis has yet to be tallied, but it is already daunting.
The Eurozone will only get back to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity in 2022, lagging behind the United States and Japan which will reach that mark already this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
The government led by Macron, who is expected to run for a second term in 2022 presidential elections, has said it was targeting 6% economic growth in 2021, but only if there was not another lockdown.
    After his government announced on Thursday that it would impose a month-long lockdown on Paris and several other regions, it was not immediately clear if the government would lower the target.
The restrictions, while not national, cover the country's biggest population centre and go significantly beyond the curfews and localised restrictions of movement at weekends that officials have been deploying so far this year.
DECISION
The officials interviewed by Reuters requested anonymity because they were discussing private deliberations.
At the end of January, French Health Minister Olivier Veran, worried about a forecast post-holiday surge of COVID-19 cases, was lobbying for a new national lockdown, according to a government source who attends meetings of the Defence Council, Macron's COVID-19 war room.
    Castex, the prime minister, wanted to keep a national lockdown on the table, according to a source close to Castex.
Asked to comment, a representative for Castex said the prime minister shared Macron’s view that there should be no pre-emptive lockdown. Veran's office declined to comment.
On the evening of Jan. 29, ministers were given an hour's notice to come to a 6:00 p.m. meeting of the Defence Council, said the government source who attended the meetings.
    The source said Macron announced to assembled officials that he had decided against a lockdown. Instead, there would be localised measures much less restrictive than the two national lockdowns imposed in 2020.
Castex arrived at the meeting unaware of what Macron would propose, according to the source close to Castex, and the government source who attended.
    But Macron's team felt they had strong grounds to make the call.
They noted that the post-holiday spike in COVID-19 cases had not materialised. Vaccines were being rolled out. They believed less severe restrictions on movement would work and also worried about the impact of a new lockdown on people's mental health.
    Another factor at play was that, days before the meeting, the Netherlands had seen three nights of anti-lockdown rioting.
    A member of parliament with Macron's party, mindful of the Dutch riots, said at the time French people were increasingly fed up with restrictions. A new lockdown could be ""the straw that breaks the camel's back,"" the lawmaker told Reuters. 
    But the biggest consideration, according to a person familiar with Macron's thinking and the parliamentary source, was the economy.
    Macron and his team believed other EU countries with three or more lockdowns would recover more slowly.
    The 2022 election is expected to be won or lost on how well France limits the economic fallout from the pandemic, said the parliamentary source.
    In the weeks afterwards, when discussing their strategy, Macron aides deployed a mantra in public and private: ""Every day we avoid a lockdown is a day gained.""
TARGETS MISSED
    As Macron embarked on his new strategy, problems emerged. A quick rollout of the vaccine was vital to keep a lid on new COVID-19 cases.
At the end of January, vaccination centres cancelled or postponed thousands of appointments because they did not have enough  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) shots. The manufacturers blamed production problems.
    Veran had predicted that 3.5-4.0 million people would have received a first shot by the end of February. Official data showed the actual figure was 3.02 million.
    New, more virulent variants of COVID-19, first identified in Britain and South Africa, spread through France and contributed to rising sickness rates.
    In Paris, longer days and sunny weather brought thousands of people into parks and to the banks of the Seine river, some defying a 6:00 p.m. curfew designed to help keep a lid on transmissions.
    On March 1, Dominique Costagliola, one of France's leading epidemiologists, told Reuters death rates were back to alarming levels.
    ""It's as if every day, there has been a fatal plane crash. So really, are the measures sufficient? I would say no,"" said Costagliola.
She does not advise the government on COVID-19; those scientists who do say they never recommend policy decisions.
By March 16, there were 1,177 people with COVID-19 in intensive care units in Paris and the surrounding region - more than at the peak of the second wave in November when France was in nationwide lockdown.
    Critical care doctors in the region said their units were close to overload.
'NO REGRETS'
    Macron's officials explored ways to ease the situation without a lockdown.
A second government source said options included setting up military hospitals and stepping up operations to medevac patients from Paris to other parts of the country.
    By Monday, the options had narrowed further.
    France followed Germany in suspending use of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccine pending investigations into reported side effects, risking further disruption to its vaccination rollout.
    The second government source said that this decision removed a big part of the rationale for avoiding another lockdown.
The same day, Guerini, the chief Macron loyalist in parliament, spoke up at a meeting for lawmakers in the prime minister's office. He picked up on the Macron team mantra about the benefits of avoiding lockdown.
    The parliamentary source who was present quoted Guerini referring to a growing public debate ""between those who think it's a day gained, and those who think it's a day lost."" 
    A representative for Guerini confirmed to Reuters he made those comments, but said they were not a criticism of Macron.
By Wednesday, Macron and his ministers had decided that lockdowns for some regions could no longer be ruled out, said the first government source, who attends Defence Council meetings.
Castex announced on Thursday that the new lockdown would be imposed on the 16 hardest-hit departments, including Paris and its surroundings, as well as parts of the north. It takes effect from midnight on Friday.
    Still, Macron's team believed it took the right decision in not ordering a lockdown earlier, on the grounds that it bought some breathing space for the economy.

    ""If you're asking me if there are regrets, no,"" said the source familiar with Macron's thinking.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was urged by a senior U.S senator to convey Washington's opposition to India's proposed purchase of Russian air defence systems as he headed to New Delhi on Friday for talks aimed at deepening security ties.
Austin is making the first visit by a top member of the Biden administration to Delhi as part of efforts to forge a alliance of countries seeking to push back against China's assertiveness in the region.
The leaders of the United States, India, Australia and Japan - countries together known as the Quad - held a first summit last week pledging to work together for a free and open Indo-Pacific and to cooperate on maritime and cyber security in the face of challenges from China. 
On Thursday, the deeply strained relations between the United States and China were on rare public display when their top diplomats levelled sharp rebukes of each others' policies in the first high-level, in-person talks of the Biden administration in Alaska.
India drew closer to the United States following its own tensions with China on their disputed Himalayan border, where deadly clashes erupted last year. Washington has helped New Delhi, leasing surveillance drones and supplying cold-weather gear for Indian troops.
During Austin's visit, the two sides will be discussing India's plan to purchase armed drones from the United States as well as a large order for over 150 combat jets for the air force and the navy to help narrow the gap with China, people with knowledge of the matter said.
One thorny issue expected to come up is India's planned purchase of Russian S-400 air defence systems which under U.S. law can attract sanctions. Washington has imposed sanctions on Turkey for buying that equipment. 
The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Menendez, urged Austin to make clear to India officials the Biden administration's opposition to deal.
“If India chooses to go forward with its purchase of the S-400, that act will clearly constitute a significant, and therefore sanctionable, transaction with the Russian defense sector under Section 231 of CAATSA,"" Menendez said in a letter to Austin, referring to the law called Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. 
""It will also limit India’s ability to work with the U.S. on development and procurement of sensitive military technology. I expect you to make all of these challenges clear in conversations with your Indian counterparts,"" he said.
U.S. firms Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed are front runners for the multi-billion dollar combat jet deals. An Indian government official said no deals were likely to be announced during the visit and that the talks would cover regional and international security issues. 

""The U.S. and India are close security partners, we expect to have wide ranging discussion with the U.S. side on how to further defence cooperation,"" the official said.

WONOGIRI, Indonesia (Reuters) - Once considered crazy by fellow villagers, Indonesian eco-warrior Sadiman has turned barren hills green after 24 years of effort, making water resources available in the drought-prone mountainous region where he lives.  
    Affectionately addressed as 'mbah' or 'grandpa', the 69-year-old has worked relentlessly to plant trees in the hills of central Java after fires to clear the land for cultivation nearly dried up its rivers and lakes. 
""I thought to myself, if I don't plant banyan trees, this area would become dry,"" said Sadiman, wearing his trademark ranger hat and safari shirt, who goes by one name, like many Indonesians.
""In my experience, banyan trees and ficus trees can store a lot of water.""
The long and wide-spreading roots of at least 11,000 banyans and ficus trees Sadiman has planted over 250 hectares (617 acres) help to retain groundwater and prevent land erosion.
Thanks to his effort, springs have formed where once there was barren and arid land, their water piped to homes and used to irrigate farms.
    Yet, at the beginning, few village residents appreciated his work. 
    ""People ridiculed me for bringing banyan tree seeds to the village, because they felt uneasy as they believed there are spirits in these trees,"" Sadiman added.
Some even thought he was a madman because he bartered saplings for the goats he reared, said one villager, Warto. 
""In the past people thought he was crazy, but look at the result now,"" Warto added. ""He is able to provide clean water to meet the needs of the people in several villages."" 
    Sadiman also funds his work through a nursery of plants such as cloves and jackfruit that he can sell or barter. 
Lack of rain in the area where he planted trees had once limited farmers to a single harvest a year, but now, the abundant water sources ensure two or three, he said.

    ""I hope the people here can have prosperous lives and live happily. And don't burn the forest over and over again,"" Sadiman added, with a twinkle in his eye.

Separately, Turkey's Human Rights Association (IHD) said its chairman, Ozturk Turkdogan, was arrested in a raid by police on his home on Friday morning. The IHD said on Twitter its lawyers were seeking information about his case.

A total of more than 35 kg (77 lb) of narcotics including about 20.5 kg of cannabis, as well as heroin, crystal methamphetamine and other drugs were seized in the raids, Singapore's Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) said.
""This operation shows that cannabis remains a clear and present threat to society,"" a CNB spokesman told a briefing on Thursday.
Three Singaporean men, aged between 27 and 33, were arrested over the haul estimated to be worth close to S$1.7 million ($1.26 million).
The last seizure of cannabis on this scale was in April 2007, when about 20.6 kg was seized.
While many countries in the world are moving to decriminalise cannabis for recreational, medical and scientific uses, Singapore shows no sign of relaxing its stance. 
""Many pro-cannabis lobby groups continue to make many unverified claims to encourage the use of cannabis, despite robust and well-documented studies on the harms of cannabis,"" the CNB spokesman said. 
The Southeast Asian nation said last year it was disappointed with the United Nations for removing cannabis from the most tightly controlled category of narcotic drugs.
The wealthy city-state has a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and imposes long jail terms or the death penalty in some cases. It has hanged hundreds of people - including dozens of foreigners - for narcotics offences over past decades, rights groups say.
The trafficking of more than 500 grams of cannabis can carry the death penalty in Singapore.

DANDONG, China (Reuters) - The court hearing for Canadian citizen Michael Spavor, detained by China since late 2018 on suspicion of espionage, ended on Friday after around two hours, in a case embroiled in a wider diplomatic spat between Washington and Beijing. 
Jim Nickel, Charge d'affaires of the Canadian Embassy in China, told reporters the court did not issue a verdict on the case, and it was not immediately clear whether there will be another hearing or when a verdict may be issued. 
Chinese courts have a conviction rate of over 99%.
Spavor was present for the hearing, Nickel said, citing confirmation from his lawyer, but Spavor was not seen outside the closed court and there was no word on his condition.
China arrested Spavor and fellow Canadian Michael Kovrig in December 2018, soon after Canadian police detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies, on a U.S. warrant. 
Beijing insists the detentions are not linked to the arrest of Meng, who remains under house arrest in Vancouver as she fights extradition to the United States.
Kovrig, a former diplomat, is due to go on trial on Monday in Beijing. 
Police set up a cordon on Friday morning outside the Dandong Intermediate People's Court, which sits along the Yalu River opposite North Korea, the isolated country that Spavor regularly visited in his business career.
Officials from the Canadian embassy and other nations including United States, Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, Denmark, Australia, Sweden and Germany had also been present outside the court as they sought access to the hearing. They were not allowed to enter. 
""We are disappointed in the lack of access and the lack of transparency,"" Nickel told reporters earlier on Friday before the trial was scheduled to begin.
""The reason that has been given is it's a so-called national security case and their belief is that the domestic law overrides international law, which in fact is not the case. China does have international obligations to allow consular access,"" he said. 
Canadian officials last saw Spavor on Feb. 3 and had made multiple requests to see him ahead of the trial, Nickel said, but those requests were denied. 
TRIAL COINCIDES WITH U.S.-CHINA TALKS
Observers have said the expected convictions of the two men could ultimately facilitate a diplomatic agreement whereby the two men are released and sent back to Canada.
The trial dates were announced by Canada just as the United States and China were preparing to hold high-level talks in Alaska, the first since U.S. President Joe Biden took office, which have proven to be contentious.
China on Thursday denied a link to those talks.
Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to Beijing, said the timing was clearly designed to coincide with the talks between the United States and China, which wants to pressure the Biden administration to arrange for Meng's release.
""We are in a very tough position because in fact unfortunately at this stage there is nothing that the Canadian government can do,"" he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp on Thursday. 
In a statement, Spavor's family called for the unconditional release of both men.
""Michael is just an ordinary Canadian businessman who has done extraordinary things to build constructive ties between Canada, China and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,"" they said.

""He loved living and working in China and would never have done anything to offend the interests of China or the Chinese people.""

336,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 01:21AM ET</span>","Outed by online campaign, children of Myanmar junta hounded abroad","By Kate Lamb
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Protesting alone outside an Australian hospital where the son of Myanmar’s attorney general works as a doctor, Burmese electrical engineer Susu San is determined to let the military junta know their children will be hounded wherever they go.
The 33-year-old woman was hard to miss as she stood in the hospital car park, dressed in a pink track suit, one hand raised in a three-fingered salute of resistance, the other clutching a placard calling for the junta to release Myanmar's elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
""They think they are untouchable,"" said Susu San, having traveled 1,500 km (930 miles) from the northern tip of Queensland to the workplace of one of the ""junta children"" at a hospital in the small city of Mackay. 
“This is a way to empower our people by saying that no one can escape from lawlessness and brutality.""
Since the coup, some protesters have launched an online campaign to denounce family members and associates of the junta in Myanmar and beyond - and spotlight those living comfortably in democratic nations far from the bloody chaos at home.
Organisers say it is a non-violent way to put pressure on the junta to reverse the coup and return Myanmar to democracy.
“The military understands one language. That is pressure,” said Tun Aung Shwe, a member of the Burmese community in Australia who was among a group that has gone to Canberra to urge the government to sanction people affiliated with the junta. 
""Social punishment is effective as it shakes up the junta, getting them to rethink what they are doing.”
Repeated calls to the military and government seeking comment were unanswered. 
Aside from shaming friends, associates and kin of the junta on social media, activists have also created a website, called socialpunishment.com, information from which has been widely shared on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
The website features more than 120 profiles of people who are accused of failing to speak out against a coup that has halted 10 years of democratic reform and brought bloody suppression. 
It ranks them on a ""traitor"" scale from elite to low, and there are photographs of the profiled person, details of their associations, and whereabouts on the globe, making it easy for Burmese in those countries to track them down. 
As of 2016, there were nearly 33,000 people from Myanmar living in Australia alone. 
Susu San said her target at the Mackay Base Hospital was 28-year-old doctor Min Ye Myat Phone Khine. 
According to the website, his mother is the junta's attorney general, Thida Oo, whose office is now crafting legal cases against Suu Kyi. She had served as a permanent secretary in the attorney general's office during the civilian government, and her acceptance of a role in the junta was seen as a deep betrayal by Suu Kyi's supporters.
Neither have responded to requests from Reuters for comment, but two days after Susu San's protest Min Ye Myat Phone Khine posted messages for the first time on his Facebook page since the coup, declaring support for the pro-democracy movement.
""I have come out of the shadow of my parents to walk my own path,"" he wrote on March 8, ""I will stand boldly with the people because I am only one citizen seeking to achieve a true and fair democracy.""
ETHICAL DOUBTS
Still, the campaign against the children of the junta has raised questions among some participants over the ethics of shaming people online because of the actions of their parents.
Anger over mass arrests and killings during anti-coup protests outweighed those qualms, campaigners said. An activist group, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, said security forces have killed more than 224 people so far. Reuters could not independently confirm this number.
Susu San grappled with the ethical complexities of targeting “junta children”, as she calls them, but ultimately decided in her mind that it was ‘fair’, given the number of Burmese being gunned down in the street. 
Min Ye Myat Phone Khine's earlier failure to speak out against the coup on his social media accounts persuaded Susu San that he was fair game.
Last week, the United States imposed sanctions on two children of Myanmar’s military leader Min Aung Hlaing and six companies they control. Britain has sanctioned more than half a dozen generals, banning entry and freezing assets, while Canada said it would take action against nine military officials.
The junta has not responded to the imposition of these sanctions, but had said earlier that it had expected sanctions and was not worried by them. 
In Australia, some in the Myanmar community are campaigning for the government to sanction children of members of the junta by freezing their assets or revoking their visas. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has still to respond to a request from Reuters for comment.
Some people targeted in Australia have had their personal information, phone numbers, places of work, and suburbs where they live, published online. 
The campaign to shame the junta is an extension of wider campaign to boycott military run companies, and isolate individuals who back the coup. 
This broader campaign, which was inspired by the protest movement, has four pillars: ""Don't sell anything to them"", ""Don't buy anything from them"", ""Don't associate with them"" and ""We will never forget.""
Amara Thiha, a Myanmar fellow at the U.S.-based Stimson Center think-tank, warned that there were signs that going after individuals online could prove counterproductive.
He noted a hardening of the language and threats used by soldiers and their supporters on social media as they came under greater pressure. 
  'PUNISH ME, NOT MY DAUGHTER'
Bryan Tun, the son of Myanmar’s commerce minister, Pwint San, is also working as a doctor in Australia. Though not listed on the website, Tun said he has been abused on social media even though he is a longtime supporter of Suu Kyi’s party, posts messages of support for the protest movement and disagrees with his father politically.
""I have been socially punishing him since this thing happened. I have been openly protesting against him,"" said Tun, 28, a doctor at Redland Hospital in Queensland. 
Reuters could not reach Pwint San for comment.
Despite his experience, Tun said he still believed the online campaign was a valid act of resistance. 
""I think that is one of the very few weapons that people have,"" he told Reuters. ""They [the military] are killing people on the streets with guns.""
But some targets of the online campaign feel victimised.
One of the first to be attacked online was Nan Lin Lae Oo, a student the social punishment campaign identified as the daughter of Lt. Gen. Kyaw Swar Lin. 
Dubbed a “murderer’s daughter”, pictures of her were plastered around the Toyo University campus in Tokyo, where she is studying. Activists have urged the university to expel her.
Reuters was unable to contact either the general or his daughter for comment. The Myanmar military has not answered calls.
A Toyo University spokesman, Masakazu Saito, said the university was now consulting with police, but declined to comment further, citing concerns for the student's safety.
The police declined to comment.
Some parents have made impassioned pleas on social media, like the wife of a retired senior military officer, Htin Zaw Win, whose daughter was identified, by the ""Civil Disobedience Movement Naming & Shaming"" on its Facebook page, as a student at Yangon's University of Medicine 1.
“You can do any kind of social punishment to me, the mother,"" Khin Khin Aye Cho wrote on Facebook. ""If it will satisfy you to beat both parents to death, then I will accept anytime and I will sacrifice my blood for my daughter.
""Please allow my daughter, the daughter of retired military family, Ayebhone Pyaecho's life to grow.

Reuters was unable to contact any of the family. They have refrained from social media since that post.

Photos of the grisly scene circulated on social media showing a bullet-riddled police car and an unmarked truck, along with officers' bodies scattered out along the street or still inside the car.
The convoy of security personnel was attacked in broad daylight by suspected gang members in the Llano Grande area in the municipality of Coatepec Harinas as it patrolled the area, said Rodrigo Martinez-Celis, security minister for the State of Mexico.
Eight of the slain officers were state police, while five other were police assigned to the state prosecutor's office.
The area is southwest of Mexico City and about 40 miles (64 km) south of the city of Toluca, the capital of the populous State of Mexico, which surrounds much of the capital.
""This attack is an affront to the Mexican state. We will respond with all force and support of the law,"" the minister said in an address to the media.
Mexico's National Guard militarized police and the armed forces are searching by land and air for the perpetrators.

It was unclear how many suspected criminals were killed or wounded in the incident, or if it involved any of the country's main drug cartels.

Global-Dining Inc, which runs the Gonpachi restaurant that inspired a fight scene in the Quentin Tarantino film, had flouted requests by the city government when a state of emergency over COVID-19 was declared in January. 
The company said on Thursday it would close Tokyo-area restaurants at 8 p.m. through Sunday, obeying the request for just the last four days of the emergency period before it expires.
Global-Dining president Kozo Hasegawa had harshly criticised the closure requests and their economic impact, saying in a March 11 letter to the Tokyo government it was like ""cutting off one's arm at the shoulder because the fingertip got infected.""
The Tokyo Metropolitan Government on Thursday issued orders against 27 restaurants that had not complied with requests to close early as a means to control the COVID-19 virus. Under revised laws, businesses can be fined 300,000 yen ($2,752.55) if they don't obey.
A representative of Global-Dining, which operates 43 eateries centered around Tokyo, said the company had not been cited under the new regulations and that it had a policy to comply with government orders.
Its Gonpachi restaurant, with a cavernous inner courtyard, inspired a bloody fight scene in Tarantino's first ""Kill Bill"" film and it was the site of a dinner between former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. President George W. Bush in 2002.

HSINCHU, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan is drilling wells, seeding clouds and beseeching a gold-faced sea goddess to help the sub-tropical island ride out its most serious drought in about half a century, after rain-soaking typhoons failed to make landfall last year.
The drought is worst across a band of western Taiwan, including the major metropolises of Hsinchu, home to many of Taiwan's renowned tech firms, Taichung in the centre of the island, and Tainan and Kaohsiung to the south.
Water levels in four major reservoirs have fallen to around or below one-tenth of capacity. Some chipmakers are buying water by the truckload for their foundries, though supplies so far are generally continuing uninterrupted for households. 
Chiang Ming-lang, director of the Water Resources Agency's northern region, told Reuters they have been piping in water from other reservoirs to the main one for Hsinchu, but it was still not enough and they were now drilling wells.
""Nobody wants to lack water. But if the heavens don't open then that's not something you or I can control,"" he said. ""Though some people say this is a short-term phenomenon, it's hard to deny this has become a long-term one."" 
Officials hope the 'plum rain' season that starts around late spring will help, but in the meantime are taking more drastic steps.
In Taichung earlier this month the Water Resources Agency took the unusual step of sending its top official for central Taiwan to a three-hour religious ceremony to pray for rain, the first time the event has been held in 58 years.
Some 3,000 people, mostly farmers as well as Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen, prayed to the sea goddess Mazu, her gold face signifying her divinity and a popular deity believed to bring good fortune and end drought. 
Yen Ching-piao, chairman of the Jenn Lann Temple where the prayers were offered, told media it didn't matter who came, only that they were sincere in their request for rain.
""Prayers give hope, and prayers bring blessings,"" he said.
Taiwan's air force has also used C-130 transport aircraft to seed the clouds, while water resources officials back up the effort from the ground by firing chemicals into the air.
Agriculture accounts for more than 70% of water consumption in Taiwan, to grow rice and fruit like mango and pineapple.
Hsinchu rice farmer Tian Shou-hsi, 63, said his crops were ""suffering terribly"".

""The spring has begun but I haven't seen any rain. I can't plant the three hectares of land I have,"" he said. ""There's no water, so we have nothing to do. Apart from tilling the soil and planting mulch for the ground, I don't know what to do.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said it would sever diplomatic relations with Malaysia after a court there ruled that a North Korean man could be extradited to the United States to face money-laundering charges, state media KCNA reported on Friday.
North Korea's foreign affairs ministry also warned Washington would ""pay a price"", in a statement carried by KCNA.
Malaysia's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The North Korean statement did not name its citizen, but in early March, Malaysia's top court ruled that a North Korean man, Mun Chol Myong, could be extradited.
Mun had been arrested in 2019 after the United States accused him of laundering funds through front companies and issuing fraudulent documents to support illicit shipments to North Korea. He fought the extradition request, arguing that it was politically motivated.
The North Korean foreign ministry called the extradition a ""nefarious act and unpardonably heavy crime"" by Malaysian authorities, who had ""offered our citizen as a sacrifice of the U.S. hostile move in defiance of the acknowledged international laws.""
Malaysia's actions had destroyed ""the entire foundation of the bilateral relations based on the respect for sovereignty,"" it said.
Kuala Lumpur's once-close ties with North Korea were severely downgraded after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's estranged brother, Kim Jong Nam, was killed at a Kuala Lumpur airport in February 2017 when two women smeared his face with VX nerve agent, which the United Nations lists as a weapon of mass destruction.
Malaysia suspended operation of its embassy in 2017 after it secured the safe return of nine citizens held in Pyongyang in exchange for the release of Kim Jong Nam's body.
Despite a promise by Malaysia's then-premier Mahathir Mohamad during an apparent thaw in diplomatic relations in 2018, the embassy never resumed operations.
North Korea had used Malaysia as a hub for its arms export operation, and to set up business entities for funneling money to North Korea's leadership.
The ministry's statement did not mention what would happen to North Korea's embassy in Kuala Lumpur.
""We warn in advance that the U.S. - the backstage manipulator and main culprit of this incident - that it will also be made to pay a due price,"" KCNA reported.

On Thursday U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the administration of President Joe Biden would complete a review of its North Korea policy in the next few weeks in close consultation with allies.

Vizcarra, who came to power in 2018 after the resignation of his predecessor but was removed from office in November by Congress, is under investigation for allegedly receiving $622,000 in bribes from two companies that won public works contracts when he was a regional authority eight years ago. 
Vizcarra, 57, denies the allegations.
Judge Maria de los Angeles Alvarez said she did not consider Vizcarra to be a flight danger while the authorities are investigating him.
In February, Vizcarra was the center of a scandal when he acknowledged that he had received the coronavirus vaccine from China's Sinopharm in October, when he was still president and months before inoculations were publicly available.

Constant corruption scandals in Peru have plagued four former presidents in the last two decades.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government will be ""more aggressive"" in telling migrants not to come to the United States, a top U.S. official said on Thursday, after earlier warnings failed to stem the flow of thousands of Central Americans to the U.S.-Mexico border.
""The message isn't, 'Don't come now,' it's, 'Don't come in this way, ever,'"" Roberta Jacobson, the White House's southern border coordinator, told Reuters in an interview. ""The way to come to the United States is through legal pathways.""
The Biden administration is wrestling with a growing humanitarian crisis at the southern U.S. border, where an uptick in the number of migrants fleeing violence, natural disasters and economic hardship in Central America is testing President Joe Biden's commitment to a more humane immigration policy.
Biden's promise to end former President Donald Trump's hardline immigration policies has been complicated by a recent spike in the number of migrants crossing the border illegally. U.S. officials are struggling to house and process an increasing number of unaccompanied children, many of whom have been stuck in jail-like border stations for days while they await placement in overwhelmed government-run shelters.
The Biden administration's message to would-be migrants has become stricter in recent days amid intense criticism from opposition Republicans that Biden's relaxation of some of Trump's policies has encouraged people to come to the United States.
Biden officials initially said migrants should not come to the United States now, but that they could come later. In an interview with ABC on Tuesday, Biden took a firmer stance, telling migrants ""don't come"" and that they would soon be able to ""apply for asylum in place.""
Jacobson echoed that tougher tone on Thursday, stressing that the policy of the United States was to expel migrants trying to cross the border illegally, with the exception of unaccompanied children. But she acknowledged that as a U.S. official her warnings might be lost amid the deception of people smugglers who are telling migrants the border is open.
She said the United States would step up its messaging effort, using social media, radio and non-governmental organizations in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to urge migrants not to travel to the U.S.-Mexico border.
""We're going to be more aggressive, more agile about getting our message out, we're going to try and combat the smugglers' messages and make sure that people understand the truth,"" she said.
A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said that effort was underway and included radio outreach in Guatemalan indigenous languages.
U.S. border authorities caught roughly 100,000 migrants at the border with Mexico in February, the highest monthly total since mid-2019. Roughly 4,500 children were being held in border facilities as of Thursday, an administration official said during a call with reporters, a slight increase from Sunday.
While Biden officials have said migrant families will be ""expelled"" to Mexico or their home countries under a Trump-era health order known as Title 42, more than half of the 19,000 family members caught at the border in February were not expelled, with many released into the United States.
Jacobson said the expulsions were limited last month by a lack of capacity in Mexico to receive them.

""Those numbers are going to change, frankly, from week to week, but the policy is that families will be expelled,"" she said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A new algorithm-based study by a group of UK universities has predicted that 63 countries – roughly half the number rated by the likes of S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch - could see their credit ratings cut because of climate change by 2030. 
Researchers from Cambridge University, the University of East Anglia and London-based SOAS looked at a ""realistic scenario"" known as RCP 8.5, where carbon and other polluting emissions continue rising in coming decades.
They then looked at how the likely negative impact of rising temperatures, sea levels and other climate change effects on countries' economies and finances might affect their credit ratings. 
""We find that 63 sovereigns suffer climate-induced downgrades of approximately 1.02 notches by 2030, rising to 80 sovereigns facing an average downgrade of 2.48 notches by 2100,"" the study https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/media/uploads/files/Rising_Climate_Falling_Ratings_Working_Paper.pdf released on Thursday said.
The hardest hit countries included China, Chile, Malaysia, and Mexico which could see six notches of downgrades by the end of the century, as well as the United States, Germany, Canada, Australia, India, and Peru that could see around four. 
""Our results show that virtually all countries, whether rich or poor, hot or cold, will suffer downgrades if the current trajectory of carbon emissions is maintained."" 
The study also estimated that as rating cuts usually increase countries' borrowing costs in international markets the climate-induced downgrades would add $137–$205 billion to countries' annual debt service payments by 2100.
In an alternative 'RCP 2.6' scenario where CO2 emissions start falling and go to zero by 2100, the rating impact would be just over half a notch on average and the combined additional cost would be a more modest $23–34 billion.
As companies' borrowing costs generally track those of the countries they operate in, their combined annual debt bills were predicted to rise $35.8–$62.6 billion in the higher emissions scenario by 2100 and $7.2–$12.6 billion in the lower one. 
""There are caveats, there are no scientifically credible quantitative estimates of how climate change will impact social and political factors,"" the paper said. ""Thus, our findings should be considered as conservative.""

Bolsonaro, who is under pressure from the worsening pandemic, defended his opposition to lockdowns on a social media webcast. 
He said his government has asked the Supreme Court to stop what he termed ""abuses"" by governors in locking down economic activity, and sent a bill to Congress that would define as essential activities ""anything that puts bread on the table.""
On Monday, he named cardiologist Marcelo Queiroga to replace Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello, a three-star army general who has come under fire for toeing the president's policies and failing to deliver timely supplies of vaccines to a country fast becoming the world epicenter of the coronavirus.
Pazuello's job was on the line after a week that saw record COVID-19 fatalities in Brazil. More than 287,000 Brazilians have died so far in the outbreak that killed more people in Brazil than any other nation last week.
Brazil had its second deadliest day in its COVID outbreak on Thursday, with 2,724 deaths, two days after reporting a record 2,841, according to the Health Ministry.
Bolsonaro said he was not ""obsessed"" with being president or running for re-election next year.

Polls this week showed that most Brazilians do not approve of his handling of the pandemic and former leftist president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva would beat him if the 2022 presidential elections were held today.

Der Spiegel reported that Tobias Zech, who represented Bavaria's CSU party in the Bundestag, had taken a ""five-digit sum"" in 2016 to advise the party of former North Macedonian Premier Nikola Gruevski. He also personally campaigned for Gruevski, Der Spiegel reported.
Zech did not immediately respond to an emailed request to comment on the allegation or confirm his resignation. There is no suggestion that any business relationship with Gruevski's party, carried out while Zech was a full-time legislator, would have been illegal.
Gruevski was later convicted of corruption in a North Macedonian court and fled to Hungary, where he was granted asylum and lives in exile.
The latest allegation comes at the worst possible time, however, for Merkel's bloc, which has already lost three lawmakers over allegations that conservative lawmakers took payments for brokering face-mask procurement deals.
The conservatives fell to historic lows in regional elections on Sunday, with voter anger at the scandal compounding frustration over Germany's sluggish deployment of coronavirus vaccines.
Merkel, always more popular than her own party, is not running for a historic fifth term in a national election later this year, leaving the question of her succession wide open, and opposition parties sense an opportunity.

A March 17 Forsa poll put the conservative bloc on 29%, down from 40% in June when Merkel won plaudits for her management of the coronavirus crisis in its first phase.

""We do not seek conflict, but we welcome stiff competition, and we will always stand up for our principles, for our people, and for our friends,"" the U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said at the start of talks with Chinese counterparts in Alaska.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken told China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and State Councilor Wang Yi in Anchorage that the U.S. side would discuss its ""deep concerns"" about Chinese actions in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as cyber attacks on the United States and economic coercion of allies.

He said Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan were all inseparable parts of Chinese territory and China firmly opposed U.S. interference in its internal affairs.
Yang said human rights in the United States were at a low point with Black Americans being ""slaughtered"" and added that the United States should handle its own affairs and China its own.

RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - As Brazil's coronavirus outbreak spirals out of control, the country is facing a dangerous new shortage, threatening to drive fatalities even higher: a lack of staff in intensive care units. 
Some medical professionals are burned out after months of grueling, soul-sapping work. Others are simply unable to keep up with the endless flow of critical COVID-19 patients pushing the country's healthcare system to the brink.
""Intensive care doctors are a commodity in short supply,"" César Eduardo Fernandes, the president of the Brazilian Medical Association (AMB) told Reuters on Wednesday. ""There's no way to meet this brutal, catastrophic demand.""
Driven by an infectious new variant, a lack of containment measures, a chaotic federal response and a patchy vaccine rollout, Latin America's biggest country has become the epicenter of the global pandemic. More than 284,000 Brazilians have died from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic - the highest death toll outside the United States.
Brazil is now accounting for one in every six coronavirus infections reported worldwide, according to a Reuters tally.
It has posted record daily deaths and caseloads this week, even as many countries are beating back the coronavirus with immunization drives, creating a political crisis for President Jair Bolsonaro and isolating Brazil internationally.
The country's health system is buckling, according to the Fiocruz biomedical institute, as intensive care units (ICUs) in 25 of 26 states and the federal district are filled beyond 80% capacity. Nineteen state capitals have passed 90% capacity. 
On Thursday, the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil's affluent business hub, recorded its first death of a patient waiting for a bed in an ICU.
""We are seeing patients arriving at a speed that we can't handle,"" said Flávia Machado, the head of intensive care at the Hospital São Paulo. ""This causes us health professionals, who are already tired, an additional stress, as we know that we are not serving everyone who needs us.""
She added that her colleagues were all exhausted and emotional, which threatened their decision-making abilities and raised the chances of them getting things wrong.
In many states, governors and mayors are struggling to open field hospitals due to a lack of qualified professionals. Public health officials are cancelling elective surgeries and converting hospital wings into makeshift ICUs, but still running up against a lack of human resources.
""Now we have 'field hospitals' set up within existing hospitals precisely so we can get support from professionals there,"" said Jean Gorinchteyn, Sao Paulo state health secretary.
Brazil has over 540,000 doctors and its ratio of physicians per capita is not far off that of the United States. However, only a fraction are qualified for specialized ICU care.

Fernandes, head of the AMB, said Brazil needed to urgently retrain doctors to work in ICUs. 
""The government should have an incentive policy so that doctors can be trained quickly,"" he said. ""It should have been done yesterday.""
Brazil's Health Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he and U.S. President Joe Biden should hold live online talks in coming days after Biden said he thought the Russian leader was a killer and diplomatic ties sank to a new post-Cold War low. 
Putin, speaking on television, cited a Russian children's playground chant to scathingly respond to Biden's accusation with the comment that ""he who said it, did it.”
In an ABC News interview broadcast on Wednesday that prompted Russia to recall its Washington ambassador for consultations, Biden said ""I do"" when asked if he believed Putin was a killer.
Biden was quick to extend a nuclear arms pact with Russia after he took office. But his administration has said it will take a tougher line with Moscow than Washington did during Donald Trump's term in office, and engage only when there is a tangible benefit for the United States.
Putin said he had last spoken to Biden by phone at the U.S. president's request and that he now proposed they had another conversation, on Friday or Monday, to be held by video-link and broadcast live.
""I want to offer President Biden that we continue our discussion, but on the condition that we do it live, online, without any delays,"" Putin said, when asked in a television interview about Biden's comments. The two leaders last spoke by telephone on Jan. 26 days after Biden took office.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki on Thursday said Biden had no regrets about calling Putin a killer and swatted away a question about Putin's request for an immediate call in public.
""I would say the president already had a conversation with President Putin, even as there are more world leaders that he has not yet engaged with,"" Psaki said. ""The president will of course be in Georgia tomorrow and quite busy.""
Putin said he was ready to discuss Russia's relations with the United States and other issues such as regional conflicts ""tomorrow or, say, on Monday,"" adding that he would be having a weekend break in a remote part of Russia. 
'WE ARE DIFFERENT' 
In his ABC comments, Biden also described Putin as having no soul, and said he would pay a price for alleged Russian meddling in the November 2020 U.S. presidential election, something the Kremlin denies. 
Russia is preparing to be hit by a new round of U.S. sanctions in the coming days over the U.S. allegations of election interference and hacking. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that Washington was tracking efforts to complete Russia's Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline and evaluating information on entities that appear to be involved. 
In a highly unusual move following Biden's interview, Moscow recalled its ambassador to the United States for consultations.
Suggesting Biden was hypocritical in his remarks, Putin said that every state had to contend with ""bloody events"" and added Biden was accusing the Russian leader of something he was guilty of himself. 
""I remember in my childhood, when we argued in the courtyard with each other we used to say: he who said it, did it. And that's not a coincidence, not just a children's saying or joke. The psychological meaning here is very deep,"" Putin said.
""We always see our own traits in other people and think they are like how we really are. And as a result we assess (a person's) activities and give assessments,"" he said.
Putin then spoke about U.S. history, talking about what he called the genocide of Native Americans, slavery and the ill treatment of Black people, and the U.S. dropping atomic bombs on Japan at the end of World War Two.
""They think that we are like them, but we are different, we have a different genetic and cultural-moral code,"" said Putin.

""We will work with them in the areas in which we are interested on terms that we consider advantageous to ourselves. They will have to deal with that regardless of all their attempts to stop us developing, regardless of the sanctions, and regardless of the insults"".

ATLANTA (Reuters) - Atlanta police on Thursday were considering all motives including hate crime in the fatal shootings of Asian women at two spas in the city as a U.S. lawmaker said the Asian-American community was ""screaming out for help"" to combat discrimination. 
Robert Aaron Long has been charged with murdering four people at the spas in Atlanta and four more in a spa in Cherokee County about 40 miles (64 km) to its north on Tuesday. Six of the victims were women of Asian descent. 
""Our investigation is looking at everything, so nothing is off the table for our investigation,"" Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Charles Hampton told a news conference in response to a question about whether police were looking at the killings as hate crimes.
Long, a 21-year-old white male, suggested to investigators that a sex addiction led him to violence. Lawmakers and anti-racism advocates have speculated the killings were motivated at least in part by anti-Asian sentiments. 
In Washington, U.S. lawmakers, professors and actor Daniel Dae Kim said the Asian-American community was reeling from a year of heightened anti-Asian attacks.
""Our community is bleeding, we are in pain and for the last year we've been screaming out for help,"" Democratic Representative Grace Meng, who is of Taiwanese descent, told a House of Representatives subcommittee. 
The Georgia killings have prompted police departments across the country to step up patrols and visibility in Asian-American communities around New York City, Chicago, Atlanta and San Francisco.
Hate crimes against Asian Americans rose by 149% in 2020 in 16 major cities compared with 2019, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.
Civil rights advocates have connected the rise in incidents to the COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in China. Some Americans, including Republican former President Donald Trump, started calling the coronavirus the ""China virus,"" ""the China plague"" and even ""kung flu.""
President Joe Biden ordered that the U.S. flag be flown at half-staff at the White House to honor the victims of Tuesday's rampage. He and Vice President Kamala Harris will visit Atlanta on Friday to offer support to the Asian-American community. 
Hampton said Long patronized the two Atlanta establishments he is accused of attacking using a 9mm gun. Authorities are not ready to release the names of the victims, he said.
Captain Jay Baker of the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department said on Wednesday that Long had confessed to the shootings and indicated he had a sex addiction and ""wanted to eliminate"" the temptation the establishments represented to him. 
A former roommate who spent several months living with Long in a halfway house for recovering addicts told Reuters Long had been treated for sex addiction, was ""deeply religious"" and would become ""very emotionally distraught that he frequented"" spas for ""explicitly sexual activity.""

Social media platforms including Twitter and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) have been under scrutiny for the way they handle accounts of politicians and government officials, particularly following their ban on former U.S. President Donald Trump's account for inciting violence after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.
Twitter said it would release a survey on March 19 to find out whether users think politicians should be subject to the usual Twitter rules and what enforcement action should be taken if they break them. The survey will close on April 12 at 5 p.m PT.
Facebook, which indefinitely suspended Trump in January, has asked its independent oversight board to decide whether the ban should stand.

Twitter said it was also in the process of consulting with human rights experts, civil society and academics about the policy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A committee of ousted civilian lawmakers in Myanmar is looking at whether it can ask the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate any crimes against humanity committed following the Feb. 1 military coup, Myanmar's U.N. envoy said on Thursday. 
Kyaw Moe Tun said the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), which is attempting to reestablish the civilian government and displace the military, is exploring ways people can be held accountable for violence following the coup. 
""The ICC is one of them,"" Kyaw Moe Tun told an event with Columbia University's Institute for the Study of Human Rights. ""We are not a state party to the ICC, but we need to... explore the ways and means to bring the case to the ICC.""
Myanmar has been in crisis since the army ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi's government in a coup, citing a November election that it called fraudulent. It has detained her and officials of her National League for Democracy party and set up a ruling junta of generals.
Security forces have used increasingly violent tactics to suppress daily demonstrations, and thousands of people have been detained. Some 217 have been killed, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group.
Independent United Nations human rights investigator Thomas Andrews told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva last week that the Myanmar military had committed killings, torture and persecution that may constitute crimes against humanity.
A junta spokesman has said the security forces have used force only when necessary.
Myanmar is not a member of the ICC. However, the CRPH has been looking closely at article 12.3 of the Rome Statute that created the court, said Kyaw Moe Tun. Under that article, Myanmar could lodge a declaration with the court registrar to ""accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the court with respect to the crime in question."" 
Such a move would likely spark a debate over who is recognized internationally as the government of Myanmar.
Kyaw Moe Tun, who publicly broke with the junta in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly last month, and U.N. special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, have said that no country should recognize or legitimize the Myanmar junta.

The U.N. Security Council can also refer situations to the Hague-based ICC, although veto-powers Russia and China would be unlikely to support such a move on Myanmar.

352,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 04:25PM ET</span>","Czech government extends pandemic restrictions on movement, no date for easing","PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech government has agreed to extend restrictions on movement among districts beyond March 21 until further notice as the coronavirus pandemic ebbs slowly, Health Minister Jan Blatny said on Thursday.
The restrictions, introduced at the beginning of March on top of the closure of schools, shops and most services and compulsory wearing of FFP2 masks, ban people from moving beyond district boundaries except for work commute and other serious reasons.
Blatny told a news conference that with daily infections no longer increasing and an emerging decline, from a peak of nearly 17,000 in early March, showed the restrictions were bringing some results and needed to be extended. 
""We see that thanks to limits on movement, there is a slower increase in regions that have been less affected and only thanks to that we are able to keep the health system functional despite the huge burden,"" he said.
He declined to say when any easing could come but said the government aimed to keep the status quo through the Easter holiday at the beginning of April, seen as risky if travel for family gatherings was allowed.
The Czech Republic suffered one of Europe's worst COVID-19 waves in October and again in January and February, with daily deaths around 200 in recent weeks and a number of hospitals running out of beds and personnel.
The government also widened orders for compulsory weekly coronavirus testing of all workers to include smaller public employers, one of the last groups not already covered, Industry Minister Karel Havlicek said. 
This will lead to nearly half a million people tested per day in the country of 10.7 million, he said.
Wide testing was a way the government deflected calls for shutdowns of industries such as manufacturing firms that are part of international supply chains.

The country has reported 24,117 deaths and hospitals reported over 9,000 patients this week including a record over 2,000 in intensive care units.

Demonstrations also took place in other towns and cities, with security forces killing three people, an activist group said. The authorities placed further restrictions on internet services, hampering protesters' ability to organise.
The move left Myanmar more isolated just as the European Union prepared to impose sanctions on the military over the Feb. 1 coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi - the daughter of Aung San.
Security forces have used increasingly violent tactics to suppress daily demonstrations.
The total toll of those killed in the weeks of unrest rose to 224, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group said. A total of 2,258 people had been arrested, charged or sentenced, it said.
In Geneva, United Nations human rights experts denounced forced evictions, arbitrary detentions and the killings of pro-democracy protesters. They said foreign governments should consider pursuing those responsible for crimes against humanity. 
The security forces have focused on stamping out dissent in the commercial capital Yangon. But the Democratic Voice of Burma reported that thousands of people marched in the central town of Natmauk. There were no reports of violence.
The Natmauk protest had a symbolic significance as it was the hometown of Aung San, who led Burma's struggle for independence from Britain but was assassinated in 1947.
His daughter Suu Kyi, aged 75, is also hugely popular for her decades-long campaign for democracy.
The Nobel peace laureate is now being held in detention at an undisclosed location while facing accusations of bribery and other crimes which could see her banned from politics and put in prison if convicted. Her lawyer says the charges are trumped up.
A lawmaker from her National League for Democracy party posted a message on social media saying that Kyi Toe, a significant NLD figure since Suu Kyi's arrest and a member of its information committee, had himself been arrested on Thursday.
Western countries have condemned the coup and called for an end to the violence and for Suu Kyi's release. Asian neighbours have offered to help find a solution, but Myanmar's military has shown no sign of seeking reconciliation.
Coup leader General Min Aung Hlaing took part in a video conference with other Southeast Asian defence chiefs, his first international engagement since seizing power, state television showed on Thursday. There was no indication the Myanmar crisis was discussed.
The army has defended its coup, saying its accusations of fraud in a Nov. 8 election swept by Suu Kyi's NLD were rejected by the electoral commission. It has promised a new election but not set a date.
MOTORBIKE PROTESTS
In other protests on Thursday, about 1,000 people on motorbikes drove around the central town of Taungoo and hundreds marched in the northern jade-mining town of Hpakant, the Irrawaddy news service reported.
Protesters also gathered in the central town of Monywa after a 24-year-old campaigner against military rule died, three days after security forces detained and beat him, the Irrawaddy and Myanmar Now news portal reported.
A junta spokesman did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.
Opponents of the coup also gathered in some neighbourhoods of Yangon, which has seen the worst of the weeks of violence. Parts of the city are under martial law.
In one district, security forces opened fire and torched protesters' barricades, detaining 20 people, the Irrawaddy reported. There were unconfirmed reports of one person wounded.
Yangon residents said soldiers also ordered people to dismantle barricades and remove posters on some streets.
Authorities have restricted the internet services that protesters use to organise and post reports and pictures, with access to Wi-Fi in public areas largely shut off by Thursday. 
Information within Myanmar is becoming increasingly difficult to verify. Some 37 journalists have been arrested, including 19 who remain in detention, the U.N. human rights office said.
SANCTIONS
International powers were meanwhile preparing to step up pressure on the junta. The European Union is due to place sanctions on individual military figures on Monday and then target businesses they run. The measures would be its most significant response so far since the coup.
Military conglomerates Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) are spread through the economy from mining and manufacturing to food and beverages to hotels, telecoms and banking. The new sanctions would bar EU investors and banks from doing business with them.
The EU's expected sanctions follow a U.S. decision last month to target the military and its business interests. Britain last month froze the assets and placed travel bans on three Myanmar generals.
The United Nations food agency said this week that rising prices of food and fuel meant many poor families faced shortages and hunger.
""Whatever happens in Myanmar over coming months, the economy will collapse, leaving tens of millions in dire straits and needing urgent protection,"" historian and author Thant Myint-U said on Twitter.
On Myanmar's border with Thailand, hundreds of people who have fled towns and cities are sheltering in areas controlled by ethnic insurgents, an official from the Karen National Union (KNU) said.
They included strike leaders, government staff, deserters from the police and military, and MPs from the ousted government, said Padoh Saw Taw Nee, whose KNU has been fighting the Myanmar army for decades.

Thai authorities were bracing for a surge of refugees and have set aside areas to shelter more than 43,000 people in Mae Sot district, according to plans seen by Reuters.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's prime minister on Thursday imposed a month-long lockdown on Paris and parts of the north after a faltering vaccine rollout and spread of highly contagious coronavirus variants forced President Emmanuel Macron to shift course. 
Since late January, when he defied the calls of scientists and some in his government to lock the country down, Macron has said he would do whatever it took to keep the euro zone's second largest economy as open as possible.
However, this week he ran out of options just as France and other European countries suspended use of the AstraZenca vaccine. 
The rapid spread of the variant first detected in Britain, now accounting for three quarters of all cases in France, has filled intensive care wards, notably in the Paris region where the incidence rate surpasses 400 in every 100,000 inhabitants.
Prime Minister Jean Castex told a press conference France was now in the grip of a third wave.
""The moment has come to go further,"" he said.
The lockdown will kick in from Friday at midnight on the 16 hardest-hit departments in the greater Paris region, the northern Hauts-de-France region, Seine et Marne and the southern Alpes-Maritimes zone. 
Schools will stay open and people will be allowed to exercise outdoors within a 10 km (6.2 miles) radius of their homes. People living in these areas will not be allowed to travel to other parts of France without a compelling reason.
Shops selling essential goods and bookstores will stay open. 
Macron stopped short of ordering a nationwide lockdown, though the Paris region is home to nearly one fifth of the population and accounts for one third of economic activity. 
A nationwide nightly curfew in place since mid-December remains in place, though it will start an hour later, at 7 p.m.
The government had no regrets about not locking down earlier in the year, Castex said.
""It was the right decision in January. We would have had a three-month lockdown. We did well not to do so.""
Castex said France would resume inoculations with the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine after the European Medicines Agency said it was safe, and that he would get the shot on Friday.

""I am confident public trust in the vaccine will be restored,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden is sending Senator Chris Coons to Ethiopia to meet with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and convey Biden's ""grave concerns"" over the humanitarian crisis in the Tigray region, where thousands have died following fighting.
Washington also said it will provide nearly $52 million more in aid to address the humanitarian crisis in the region, but called for hostilities to end and human rights abusers to be held accountable.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the immediate withdrawal of Eritrean forces, an end to the Ethiopian government's deployment of regional forces in Tigray and increased humanitarian access.
""The humanitarian situation will continue to worsen without a political solution,"" Blinken said in a statement.
Fighting between government troops and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) has killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes in the mountainous region of about 5 million.
The United Nations has raised concerns about atrocities being committed in Tigray, while Blinken has described acts carried out in the region as ethnic cleansing. Ethiopia has rejected Blinken's allegation.
""(The accusation) is a completely unfounded and spurious verdict against the Ethiopian government,"" Ethiopia’s foreign ministry said on March 13, reacting to the allegation of ethnic cleansing.
""Nothing during or after the end of the main law enforcement operation in Tigray can be identified or defined by any standards as a targeted, intentional ethnic cleansing against anyone in the region,"" it said. ""The Ethiopian government vehemently opposes such accusations.""
Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement that Coons - a longtime Biden ally who represents the president's home state of Delaware - would also consult with the African Union.
""Senator Coons will convey President Biden's grave concerns about the humanitarian crisis and human rights abuses in the Tigray region and the risk of broader instability in the Horn of Africa,"" Sullivan said. The senator serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's subcommittee on Africa and global health policy.
Officials in the prime minister's office and at the foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Coons said he looked forward to engaging with Abiy and conveying Biden's concern.
""The United States is gravely concerned by the deteriorating situation in the Tigray, which threatens the peace and stability of the Horn of Africa region,"" Coons said in a statement.
Ethiopia's federal army ousted the TPLF from the Tigray capital Mekelle in November, after what it said was a surprise assault on its forces in the region bordering Eritrea.
The government has said most fighting has ceased but acknowledged there are still isolated incidents of shooting.

Ethiopia and Eritrea have denied the involvement of Eritrean troops in the fighting, although dozens of witnesses, diplomats and an Ethiopian general have reported their presence.

AMMAN (Reuters) - When Syrian teenager Basheer Abazed was arrested a decade ago for scrawling anti-government graffiti on his school wall, he never imagined an uprising would flare that would devastate his country. Now, he mourns the terrible human cost of the revolt. 
""The war...broke a lot of things in our lives, it took away our childhood and joy, it made us grow up before our time,"" Abazed, now 25, said by phone from Turkey where now lives, exiled far from his hometown of Deraa in southwestern Syria.
Deraa became the cradle of the uprising and later insurgency against President Bashar al-Assad after two dozen teenagers including Abazed were rounded up and tortured by secret police for writing slogans against the Syrian autocrat.
The youths' act of defiance emulated the start of other ""Arab Spring"" uprisings that overthrew dictators in Tunisia and Egypt, and their brutal treatment in detention brought long latent discontent boiling to the surface. 
It escalated into street protests that were met with deadly fire by armoured security forces. Clashes spread nationwide and metastasized into civil war that devastated much of Syria before Assad snuffed out the insurgency with Russian and Iranian help.
Abazed, one of over two million Syrians who fled the war to neighbouring Turkey, recalls how a Syrian security officer forced him to confess under duress that he had scrawled the slogan, ""Your turn is coming, Doctor Bashar.""
Abazed was freed days later as the first round of mass pro-democracy demonstrations loosened the authorities' iron grip and security forces resorted to gunning down peaceful protesters.
After years of bloodshed and chaos, Abazed and his family finally left Deraa - which remained a rebel bastion for years close to the southern border with Jordan - in May 2017 and made their way to Turkey, where he now works in construction.
He still has nightmares of tanks rolling though his crowded Deraa neighbourhood, relatives and friends who were shot dead and others who began to carry arms and turned into insurgents, triggering civil war that shattered countless lives.
MILLIONS FEAR RETURNING HOME
Today Abazed and many of his townsfolk are among millions of refugees who have built new lives in neighbouring countries and beyond in Europe, with no intention of returning any time soon. 
Many fear they would be drafted into the army or arrested and know that their towns and villages where anti-Assad feeling ran high were pillaged and destroyed. Most say they will never go home until Assad's rule is over.
Only a handful of the original inhabitants of Abazed's old Hay al Arbeen neighbourhood in Deraa remain, the streets mostly deserted. Some told Reuters by internet voice messaging that disaffection has grown again since Assad's forces backed by Russian air power finally retook the town from rebels in 2019.
Police repression has resumed amidst the economic ruin, they said, while authorities have restored statues and portraits of Assad and his late father in public places that were torn down in the early days of the uprising.
""Nothing has changed from the days when we chanted for freedom,"" Abazed said bitterly. ""We demanded our rights. But the regime has not learnt any lesson. If anything it has become more vicious, clinging even more to power.""
A Deraa resident told Reuters that, in one small gesture of defiance, dozens of people marked the 10-year anniversary on Thursday by chanting anti-government slogans in the streets of the town's ancient quarter out of sight of security forces.
Assad appears secure again after outlasting an insurgency that once posed the gravest dire threat to his family's rule since he succeeded his father Hafez al-Assad 20 years ago. 
""(But) even if Bashar has now taken back control, the revolution will not end and Bashar will never rule Syria as he used to,"" Abazed said. 

""My anger is against those who claimed they stood for human rights but let us down and left us to our fate,"" he said, alluding to Western powers which did not intervene against Assad in the conflict.

The sanctions would come in the form of an interim report that may also single out an insurance company that has been working with the vessels laying the pipeline in the Baltic Sea as well as other companies providing support vessels and materials to the project, according to the report.
Nord Stream 2 will bypass Western ally Ukraine, potentially depriving it of valuable transit fees. It will also increase European energy dependency on Russia and compete with shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
The U.S. State Department is tracking efforts to complete the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and evaluating information regarding entities that appear to be involved, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday.
""Any entity involved in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline risks U.S. sanctions and should immediately abandon work on the pipeline,"" Blinken said in a statement.

The issue of how Sturgeon, her party and her government dealt with allegations against her former ally and mentor Alex Salmond, has escalated into a major threat to her leadership and to her dream of leading Scotland to independence.
""First Minister Nicola Sturgeon misled Parliament, concludes Holyrood harassment committee,"" said James Matthews, Sky's Scotland bureau chief, in a Tweet. The Scottish parliament is based in Holyrood, Edinburgh.
Matthews said the committee, which heard lengthy evidence from Sturgeon on March 3, said she had given ""an inaccurate account of what happened and she has misled the committee on this matter"".
If confirmed, such a finding would put Sturgeon under intense pressure to resign, upending Scottish politics just as crucial elections loom in May.
Sturgeon leads the Scottish National Party (SNP), the dominant party in the country. Prior to the Salmond controversy blowing up, the SNP was expected to win an absolute majority in the Scottish parliament, which Sturgeon has argued would give her a mandate to demand a second referendum on independence.
Recent polls have shown the bad blood between her and Salmond, who led the SNP for years before she did, had already dented the party's lead. Sturgeon's resignation would likely cause chaos in the SNP's election campaign.

Salmond, who stood trial on charges of sexual assault and was acquitted, has portrayed himself as the victim of a conspiracy to drive him out of public life. Sturgeon has rejected that as absurd.

(Reuters) - A 10th juror was seated on Thursday in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer facing murder charges over his arrest of George Floyd, a process that was complicated by the city's announcement of a $27 million settlement with Floyd's family.
The woman was questioned for an hour by Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill, Chauvin's lead lawyer and a lawyer working for the Minnesota district attorney's office to assess her impartiality during a process known as voir dire.
The woman, as with virtually all potential jurors screened, told the court she had seen some of the video showing Chauvin, who is white, with his knee on Floyd's neck for about nine minutes as Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man in handcuffs, begs for his life. The video of the arrest on May 25, 2020, sparked global protests against racism and police brutality.
The juror, described in court records as a white woman in her 50s, said she was a registered nurse who lived alone. When asked by Chauvin's lead lawyer, Eric Nelson, if she thought it was acceptable to sometimes ""second guess"" a police officer's judgment, she said yes.
""They are human,"" she explained. Chauvin, dressed in a suit and tie, took extensive notes on a yellow legal pad.
The judge has promised all jurors anonymity for the duration of the trial.
On Wednesday, he had to dismiss two members seated during jury selection last week after they said last Friday's news of the city of Minneapolis paying Floyd's relatives $27 million to settle their federal wrongful-death lawsuit meant they could no longer be impartial. 
Chauvin, 44, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter, and faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge. 
He and three other officers were arresting Floyd on suspicion he had bought cigarettes using a fake $20 bill. The Minneapolis Police Department fired all four officers the next day, and the three other men are due to face trial later this year on aiding and abetting charges.
Chauvin's lawyer has argued that publicity surrounding the high-profile trial is prejudicial for Chauvin, and has asked the judge to reconsider a motion to move the trial to another county. Cahill has said he is considering that request and will rule later.
The rest of the jury seated so far comprises two other white women, two white men, two Black men who immigrated to the United States from abroad and two multiracial women, according to court records.

The jury will consist of 12 jurors and two alternates. Cahill has told jurors to avoid the news as best they can and to report back to court on March 29 for opening arguments in the trial.

The foreign ministry's announcement that Mexico would restrict movement on its border with Guatemala comes just as the country plans to step up enforcement efforts in the area against illegal immigration, according to a Reuters report.
President Joe Biden is under increasing pressure to reduce a recent surge in migrants from Central America reaching the U.S. border while Mexico has been pressing the U.S. government for a loan of vaccines to help its drive to tackle COVID-19. 
A U.S. congressional source said the mutually beneficial news on the vaccines and the border curbs was no coincidence. A Mexican official did not immediately reply to a request for comment on whether the two announcements were linked.
Confirming details reported by Reuters, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said that Mexico and the United States were crafting a deal for 2.5 million doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine and that he would reveal more on Friday.
""This would be the best start for a broad cooperation on vaccines,"" Ebrard said on Twitter.
A U.S. official told Reuters that under the loan deal, the United States would send Mexico 2.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine that it is not using. Canada is also set to receive 1.5 million doses under the arrangement.
In a statement, Mexico's foreign ministry said restrictions for non-essential activities on its borders with the United States and Guatemala would take effect starting on Friday, and would remain in place until midnight of April 21.
During the past few months, Mexico had announced extensions to restrictions along its border with the United States as part of bilateral efforts to stem the spread of the pandemic.
Those monthly communiques did not mention the border with Guatemala, where average COVID-19 cases are now lower than they were in January, though they have been ticking up.
Mexico's own infections have fallen sharply in the last few weeks, and the two southern states covering over 85% of the border with Guatemala are two of only three in the country at the lowest COVID-19 alert level, health ministry data show.

Mexico has 31 states.

KABUL (Reuters) - As envoys gathered in Russia's capital for a shake up of the Afghan peace process, Afghan women wondered - what about us?
Just one woman, rights advocate and politician Habiba Sarabi, was on the 12-member delegation of Afghan government and political leaders attending Thursday's summit in Moscow. The 10-member delegation sent by the Islamist Taliban had none.
On Thursday, Sarabi addressed a vast circular table of male counterparts at a Moscow hotel, calling for a ceasefire.
""Why should (I) be the only woman in the room? We have not been part of the war, we can certainly contribute to peace,"" she said, according to a tweet from a fellow negotiator that she shared.
""Fifty-one percent of people should not be ignored.""
With just six weeks left before a deadline for foreign troops to withdraw from Afghanistan, Shaharazad Akbar, who leads Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission, said it was unacceptable that only one woman attended the meeting.
It was also a worrying sign for the future: ""It's setting the tone for things to come in terms of inclusivity,"" she said.
WARLORDS 
The Moscow summit was the start of a series of international meetings reflecting a shift in focus by Washington, as a May 1 deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. and other foreign troops looms, and negotiations between the government and Taliban in Doha have been stalled.
Diplomats say Washington wants support from regional powers to push Afghans to form a power-sharing government. At the talks in Moscow, the United States was joined by Russia, China and Pakistan in calling for an Afghan ceasefire.
Women's rights activists fear that the shift will further dilute the role of the few women involved in the peace process, in favour of traditional male political figures.
In many cases, the regional powers owe their influence in Afghanistan to ties with warlords who held sway throughout four decades of conflict, all of them men.
""A number of our colleagues in the international community are going to...the same leaders, who ruled Afghanistan twenty years ago,"" said Fauzia Koofi, one of just four female negotiators among the 42 representing the Afghan sides in Doha.
A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said Washington wished there had been more than one woman in the Moscow delegation. The United States would advocate for ""meaningful participation"" by women in upcoming gatherings.
""Women, girls, and minority groups in Afghanistan have made extraordinary gains...and preserving those gains is a high priority for the Biden Administration,"" the spokesperson said.
A spokesman for Afghanistan's presidential palace did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
During their 1996-2001 rule, the Taliban enforced an interpretation of Islamic law that was among the harshest towards women's rights on earth. Women were required to fully cover their bodies and faces in a burqa, and barred from education or work, or from leaving the house without a male relative. The Taliban say they have changed but many women remain sceptical.
Since the Taliban were driven from power in 2001 by U.S. air strikes, the international community has poured billions into Afghanistan's development. Gains for women and girls in access to education and public life are repeatedly touted as one of the major successes of two decades of foreign involvement.

""It's...ridiculous to expect a single woman, in a room full of not just men, but in many cases men with long track records of abusive attitudes and conduct toward women, to carry all women's rights on her shoulders,"" said Heather Barr, Interim Co-Director of the Women's Rights Division at Human Rights Watch, who nevertheless said Sarabi would do all she could.

Bosnia has long proclaimed integration with NATO and the European Union as strategic goals. But the Bosnian Serbs, led by pro-Russian Milorad Dodik who currently chairs the country's tripartite presidency, want the country to remain neutral and stay out of the U.S.-led military alliance.
""In the case of practical rapprochement of Bosnia and Herzegovina and NATO, our country will have to react to this hostile act,"" the embassy said.
It continued that the purpose of NATO was a ""fight against Russia"" and joining NATO will force Sarajevo to take a side in the ""military-political confrontation"".
Bosnia and Serbia are the only two Western Balkan countries that remain outside NATO after North Macedonia joined the alliance last year.
On Thursday, the new Russian ambassador to Bosnia Igor Kalabuhov met Zeljko Komsic, the Croat presidency member who advocates Bosnia's integration into the alliance.
A statement from Komsic's office did not mention NATO integration as a topic of the meeting, but said they discussed reforms that Bosnia needs to make to get closer to EU membership.
Russia has long maintained its opposition to Bosnia joining NATO. 

Komsic and Bosniak presidency member Sefik Dzaferovic declined to meet visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergej Lavrov in December, saying he has shown disrespect to their state after his meeting with Dodik outside Sarajevo with no Bosnian national flag on display.

It plans to pursue discussions at the U.N.'s aviation agency ""in the coming weeks and months"" to assure independence in cases where state militaries are involved in bringing down airliners, Kathy Fox, chair of Canada's Transportation Safety Board (TSB), said on Thursday.
Iran's civil aviation body on Wednesday blamed misalignment of a missile launcher's radar and an error by an Iranian air defence operator for the downing of the aircraft in January 2020.
While the TSB called the scenario a ""plausible explanation for what happened,"" the independent agency said the report lacked evidence. Ukraine called it a cynical attempt to cover up the true reasons for the crash.
While the rules governing air accident probes, known throughout the industry by their legal name “Annex 13,” work well, Fox said ""this most recent event and investigation demonstrates that it has limitations.""
Drawing their name from an annex to the Convention on International Civil Aviation - commonly known as the 1944 Chicago Convention - they represent a low-key but effective form of international co-operation that has rarely been challenged.
Under those rules Iran retained overall control of the air investigation even as its military was implicated in the event, leading to an ""unprecedented"" situation, Fox told reporters.
""What we would like to see are changes to Annex 13 that would facilitate more transparency and independence in these unique cases where a state military has been involved in bringing down a civilian airliner,"" Fox said.

Such changes could allow the use of independent observers, or delegation by countries, such as Ukraine agreeing to Dutch control of an investigation into the 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17.

Nini Johana Usuga, the sister of Clan del Golfo leader Dairo Antonio Usuga, who is known as Otoniel, was captured on Wednesday night in Sabaneta, a municipality close to Colombia's second city Medellin, General Jorge Luis Vargas, director of Colombia's police, told journalists.
""There is a lot of testimony, as well as material evidence and physical evidence, that connects her to the drug trafficking of the Clan del Golfo,"" Vargas said. 
Information gathered by police suggests the 39-year-old woman was in charge of managing illicit finances connected to drug trafficking via money laundering, and that - due to her family ties - she is one of her brother Dario's closest confidants within Clan del Golfo, Vargas said. 
Clan del Golfo has some 1,600 fighters and is involved in the production and trafficking of cocaine, as well as illegal mining. 
Colombia's government accuses the group of threatening and killing local activists - known as social leaders - in the country.

The United States is offering a $5 million reward for information that leads to the capture of Otoniel, who is accused of trafficking hundreds of tonnes of cocaine to the North American country, while Colombia is offering just over $800,000.

(Reuters) - A Washington State school district did not violate the religious and free speech rights of a high school football coach by forbidding him from kneeling in prayer at the 50-yard line after games, a federal appeals court ruled unanimously on Thursday.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Bremerton school district would have violated the First Amendment's ban on government establishment of religion by letting Joseph Kennedy pray in view of spectators, and with students who might feel pressured to join him.
It rejected Kennedy's claim he was engaging in ""private"" prayer, citing his efforts to draw local and national support, and said district personnel had received ""hateful"" and ""threatening"" emails, letters and calls from around the country.
""Although there are numerous close cases chronicled in the Supreme Court's and our current Establishment Clause caselaw, this case is not one of them,"" Circuit Judge Milan Smith wrote for a three-judge panel.
Lawyers for Kennedy and those representing the school district did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Kennedy had been an assistant coach at Bremerton High School outside Seattle from 2008 to 2015, when he was put on leave. His contract later expired.
The coach's case drew support from religious conservatives and free speech advocates, and from 21 Republican state attorneys general who accused the school district of ""censuring Kennedy as an excuse to prohibit his religious exercise.""
In 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Kennedy's appeal from the 9th Circuit's earlier rejection of an injunction allowing him to pray.
Four conservative justices - Samuel Alito, joined by Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh - wrote separately that the appeals court's understanding of teachers' free speech rights was ""troubling and may justify review in the future.""
Thursday's decision upheld a March 2020 dismissal by U.S. District Judge Ronald Leighton in Tacoma, Washington, who recently retired.
The case is Kennedy v Bremerton School District, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-35222.

""It's time to say goodbye,"" Fidesz Vice Chairwoman Katalin Novak wrote on Twitter, posting a brief letter which said it ""no longer wishes to maintain its membership in the (EPP), thus resigns.""
The EPP suspended Fidesz ahead of European parliamentary elections in 2019, but stopped short of expelling it permanently, despite Prime Minister Viktor Orban having campaigned with posters that demonised EPP member Jean-Claude Juncker, then head of the European Commission.
""I think that Mr Orban is a long way from basic Christian Democratic values,"" Juncker said at the time.
Fidesz quit the EPP's group in the European Parliament earlier this month. 
The EPP is the biggest party in the European Parliament, and its largest national contingent is Angela Merkel's German conservatives.
Orban's nationalist policies have long been seen as a better fit with smaller European blocs to the right of the EPP, such as the eurosceptic ECR that includes Poland's ruling Law and Justice, or the rightwing ID that includes France's National Rally and Italy's far-right League. Orban has said in the past he was in talks with likeminded parties about a new political alliance.
Orban, 57, has been in office since 2010. He faces elections in 2022, with the opposition united against him for the first time and opinion polls showing a neck-and-neck race.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council on Thursday condemned an escalation in fighting in Yemen's Marib, calling for the Houthis to end an offensive on the government's last northern stronghold, and pushing for the government to allow fuel into Hodeidah port. 
In a statement, the 15-member council also condemned cross-border attacks against Saudi Arabia and said the escalation in Marib ""threatens efforts to secure a political settlement when the international community is increasingly united to end the conflict.""
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 after the Iran-aligned Houthi group ousted the country’s government from the capital Sanaa. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.
Since taking office in January, U.S. President Joe Biden has made Yemen a priority and appointed special envoy Tim Lenderking to help revive stalled U.N. efforts to end the conflict. Lenderking said on Friday that a ceasefire plan was before the Houthi leadership and urged them to respond. 
The U.N. Security Council, which was briefed on Yemen on Tuesday, ""stressed the need for de-escalation by all, including an immediate end to the Houthi escalation in Marib."" 
U.N. Yemen mediator Martin Griffiths warned on Tuesday that the war in Yemen was ""back in full force."" Both Griffiths and U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock also said that commercial fuel imports into Hodeidah port had been blocked since January and urged the government to allow deliveries.

The Security Council on Thursday ""expressed concern over the dire economic and humanitarian situation, and emphasized the importance of facilitating humanitarian assistance as well as the movement of fuel ships into Hodeidah port.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States imported $2.4 billion worth of seafood from illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in 2019, representing 11% of total U.S. imports, the U.S. International Trade Commission said in a report released on Thursday.
The report, from an investigation requested by the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee in December 2019, found that the removal of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) seafood imports would increase the total operating income of the U.S. commercial fishing industry by an estimated $60.8 million. Seafood prices and catch sizes would increase for all species modeled.
The U.S. commercial fisheries that would benefit most include those targeting warmwater shrimp, sockeye salmon, bigeye tuna and squid, according to the report https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub5168.pdf.
The International Trade Commission found that over 13 percent of wild-caught seafood imports were derived from IUU fishing. It identified China, Russia, Mexico, Vietnam and Indonesia as ""relatively substantial exporters"" of illegally caught seafood to the United States.
Meanwhile, the report said Canada, the largest exporter of seafood to the United States, is ""low risk"" for IUU seafood. 
The report also found that IUU seafood is often used to make fishmeal to support aquaculture, with nearly 9 percent of the harvested weight of farmed seafood imports into the United States fed with IUU-derived ingredients.
IUU violations can come from many sources, including vessels fishing in areas or during seasons in which they are not authorized, harvesting seafood in excess of quotas, misreporting catch volumes or fishing with disallowed gear or methods, the panel said.
“Far too much illegal seafood is making its way onto our dinner plates and more must be done,” Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal said in a statement on the report, adding that enhanced tracing of the U.S. seafood supply chain was needed.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump’s decision to put Cuba back on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism just before he left office threw up fresh obstacles to international banking with the island, according to five Havana-based foreign businessmen and diplomats.
The businessmen and diplomats, all of whom requested anonymity, said the few Western banks willing to stand up to already comprehensive U.S. sanctions on the island have stopped transactions or implemented new layers of compliance.
Washington took Communist-run Cuba off the terrorism list in 2015 as part of a thaw in relations under former President Barack Obama. The Trump administration took several steps to reverse that detente, including the terrorism redesignation just days before Trump left office in January.
One of the businessmen cited an email sent by a European bank on March 16, which said in part: “Our legal department after analyzing all the documentation said they will not allow us to open an account for you as they estimate that the risk of working with a company with business in Cuba is too high”.
“These types of letters are nothing new but are increasingly frequent and common,” the businessman said. He asked that the bank not be named.
He said the non-Cuban company planned to receive proceeds from Cuban exports abroad and pay island suppliers abroad, thus there would have been no transactions directly with Cuba.
The increased caution resulted in ""the number of counter parties being reduced, increased delays and costs, thereby undermining Cuba’s ability to insert itself into global production chains,"" he said.
President Joe Biden's administration has said it is reviewing the terrorism relisting.
Cuba has called the Trump decision a politically motivated move aimed at placating Cuban-American exiles and sabotaging efforts to improve relations.
Many analysts believe Biden will reverse the terrorism decision in the coming months, but in the meantime it is further undermining the Cuban economy, which fell 11% last year and has shown no sign of improvement so far in 2021, with key earner tourism down 95% compared with the same period last year due to the pandemic.
In giving reasons for the relisting, then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Cuba was ""repeatedly providing support for acts of international terrorism"" by harboring U.S. fugitives and Colombian rebel leaders, as well as supporting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
“The actual issues given by Trump and Pompeo for their move of harboring for example some alleged murderers would normally be dealt with by diplomacy if the country were any other but Cuba,” said Paul Hare, a former British ambassador to the island who lectures on global studies at Boston University.
INCREASED COMPLIANCE
John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said that banks have to protect themselves from scrutiny by the U.S. government. 
“Those financial institutions which continue their Cuba-related transactions have been required to expand their internal compliance, which was already onerous, even though most c-suite executives believe that the Biden administration will eventually remove Cuba from the list,"" he said.
The issue has affected not just businesses but some embassies, which have had trouble accessing their accounts since the January relisting, the diplomats said.
“We’re still having a problem with financial transfers for the embassy and each one of the diplomats posted here in Havana,” an Asian envoy said.

“Our European bank hasn’t been able to receive any amount of money transferred from our country due to the systematic rejection by some of the intermediate banks since mid-January of any kind of transfer related to Cuba,” he said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri said on Thursday after a meeting with President Michel Aoun that forming a government that could re-engage with the IMF was the only way to halt the country's financial collapse. 
The meeting took place after a heated exchange on Wednesday night between the two politicians, who have been at loggerheads for months over cabinet formation. 
Aoun, in a televised speech, asked Hariri to form a new government immediately or make way for someone else. Hariri hit back by telling him that if he could not approve his cabinet line-up then he should call an election. 
On Thursday, Hariri's tone was more positive after saying a further meeting was scheduled for Monday and that he saw ""an opportunity to be seized"". 
""The main priority of any government is to prevent the collapse that we are facing today... that we proceed to start halting the collapse with the IMF and regain the trust of the international community,"" he told reporters. 
Lebanon's talks with the IMF stalled last year over a row among government officials, bankers and political parties over vast financial losses.
The Lebanese pound has sunk by 90% in the country's worst crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war. It has plunged many into poverty and endangered imports as dollars grow scarce. 
Politicians have since late 2019 failed to agree a rescue plan to unlock foreign cash which Lebanon desperately needs.
In Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron said he would push for a new approach in the coming weeks as Lebanon's main actors had made no progress to resolve the crisis.
""We are really looking at the abyss, seeing it very clearly, and I think it's either now or never,"" Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said, alluding to the urgency of forming a new government able to make reforms. 
He added that major political parties, including Aoun's ally, the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, were re-evaluating their positions as delays worsen the economy's free-fall and unrest grows. 
STRIKES AND CLOSURES 
The currency has crashed so fast in recent weeks, losing a third of its value, that grocery shops closed on Wednesday and bakeries cautioned they may have to follow suit.
Many pharmacies shut their doors on Thursday and flashed neon strike signs, the latest sector of the economy to voice frustration. 
Ali Obaid, a Beirut pharmacist, said he could no longer keep up with expenses. ""Pharmacies will close permanently if this continues,"" he said. 
Comments that subsidies - including on fuel, wheat and medicine - may soon end have also triggered panic buying. 
Cars lined up outside gas stations earlier this week, and scenes of brawls over subsidised goods at supermarkets have heightened fears among Lebanese over their most basic needs. 

The sharp descent of the pound sent protesters into the streets this month, blocking roads in anger at an entrenched political elite that has dominated since the civil war.

France, along with Britain, Germany and the European Union, is trying to bring the United States and Iran to the table for informal talks that would be a first step to reviving the 2015 deal, which lifted international sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs to its nuclear programme.
Both sides so far appear unwilling to compromise. The Iranian New Year this week and campaigning for the country's presidential election in June are also likely to complicate matters.
""Iran must stop aggravating a serious nuclear situation with an accumulation of violations of the Vienna accord,"" Macron said alongside President Reuven Rivlin of Israel, an arch foe of Iran in the Middle East region. 
""Iran must make the expected gestures and behave in a responsible way,"" Macron added.
Macron said Paris would continue to work to revive a credible process to end this crisis. 
""That means a return to control and supervision of the nuclear programme, but also to integrating - as we have called for since 2017 - the control of Iran's ballistic missile activity,"" he added. 

Iran has ruled out broadening nuclear talks to other subjects. Since the United States quit the 2015 deal when Donald Trump was president, Iran has progressively reduced its compliance with the pact.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - A shower before work? Not any more, say many residents of the Lithuanian capital, who like people around the globe have got used to working from home over the past year to help halt the spread of the coronavirus.
Highlighting the shift in people's daily habits, a gauge in the control centre of the Vilnius Central Heating Company that tracks hot water consumption in 220,000 households around the city now shoots up around mid-morning.
""Peak hot water usage on workdays always used to be between 6 and 8 am, so before work, but now we see the peak between 10 and 11 am. This is obviously because of the pandemic,"" said company CEO Gerimantas Bakanas.
""A lot of people are working from home and obviously when they get up they no longer take a shower.""
Lithuania has been in its latest lockdown since December. Shops, restaurants and offices are closed, and schools have moved online, so people mostly stay at home.
""Now we get up, we prepare breakfast for the kids and do some tasks at our computers, and after that, at around 10, we eat our breakfast and take a shower,"" said Rimgaudas Leonavicius, who lives with his wife, three children and two dogs in the historic old town of Vilnius.
""It was different before the lockdown... Showers came first. But now there's no more rush, and we can spend our mornings as we like"", said Rimgaudas.

KETAMA, Morocco (Reuters) - In Morocco's impoverished Rif mountains, cannabis grower Mohamed El Mourabit hopes a plan to legalise the drug for some uses will raze what he calls a ""wall of fear"" surrounding farmers caught between poverty, traffickers and the law. 
The government last week approved a law to allow the cultivation, export and use of cannabis for medicine or industry. Parliament looks likely to ratify it, despite the issue dividing the governing coalition's biggest party.
The change is meant to improve the lot of farmers in the often restive Rif region where it has been grown for decades, and to tap into a growing global market for legal cannabis. 
But the law has divided opinion among Rif farmers, who fear it will do nothing to address a years-long slide in their income or help them escape outstanding arrest warrants. 
Some want the law to allow recreational cannabis use and its processing into more lucrative resin - ""hashish"". Others want its cultivation or development for medicinal or industrial purposes limited to their region alone. 
""We are fed up with fear and secrecy. We want a decent life,"" said Mourabit, speaking on a mountain peak overlooking cannabis fields above the village of Ketama. 
Nearly a million people live in areas of northern Morocco where cannabis is the main economic activity. It has been publicly grown and smoked there for generations, mixed with tobacco in traditional long-stemmed pipes with clay bowls. 
Outside Ketama, the sound of workers beating fine fabric sieves to sift powder from leaves before processing into hashish echoed across the steep terraced fields where a farmer was ploughing with a team of mules. 
""We tried growing cereals but the weather and yield were not enough to live on. Cannabis is all that grows here,"" the farmer said, standing near a cottage with a rusted iron roof. 
The United Nations drugs agency says about 47,000 hectares of the Rif are devoted to cannabis output, about a third the amount in 2003 after government crackdowns. Morocco remains one of the world's top illegal exporters of the drug, it says. 
POVERTY
As the road rises towards Ketama, cedar-topped mountains and terraces replace the lush scenery of olive groves and cereal farms. Despite its wild beauty, there is no tourism. 
The absence of state authority was clear near Ketama as two young men furiously honked their car horn, stopping traffic to offer hashish for sale. 
A resident at a litter-strewn public park said many younger locals wanted to cross to Spain, despite the dangerous voyage. 
Some 30,000 people around Ketama are wanted by police for cannabis offences. ""I was arrested for transporting our homemade resin to a dealer,"" said a farmer, scattering seeds in a field. 
One of the Rif's biggest cities, Al-Hoceima, saw protests in 2016-17 over economic and social conditions. The state has long seen tolerance for cannabis production as a way to buy social peace. 
Mourabit fears the new law will lead more fertile regions to start growing cannabis too. ""We need to limit farming of the herb to its historical areas,"" he said. 
Along the country roads, tractors and farm equipment stood ready with manure to fertilise fields before sowing this year's crop. 
AN 80-YEAR CURSE
Prices have fallen hard in recent years as more potent, high-yield strains emerged. A farmer could sell a kilogram of hashish for 15,000 dirhams ($1,670) a decade ago but only gets 2,500 dirhams for it now, locals said. 
""The dealer sets the price"", said the farmer with the mules.
If hashish production is not permitted in the legalised trade, their income will be hit still harder. A tonne of unprocessed cannabis fetches $700 for industrial use. The same amount would produce 12kg of hashish worth $3,340. 
Saleh Lakhbech, a university student and son of a local farmer, believes the bill was dreamed up ""in air conditioned rooms without consulting farmers"" and thinks the government should instead invest to build an alternative economy for the region. 

""Cannabis is a curse that has marginalised us for 80 years,"" he said, surrounded by angry, nodding farmers.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission on Thursday urged negotiators to finish the EU's landmark climate law in time for an international summit next month, saying the legislation would support Europe's bid to lead the world in fighting climate change.
The EU's climate law will formalise its goal to have zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and a 2030 target to cut emissions faster than previously planned.
But more than a year on from the Commission's proposal of the bill, negotiators representing EU governments, the European Parliament and the Commission, still have not finished its contents. 
EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans on Thursday called on them to finalise the law by a climate leaders' summit on April 22, organised by the U.S. government.
""We want to show the world that the EU leads on global climate action,"" Timmermans told a virtual meeting of EU environment ministers, parts of which were publicly broadcast.
Hitting that deadline ""is extremely important if Europe wants to maintain its leadership role and wants to invite the rest of the world to follow,"" he said.
The United States is due to announce its own target to cut CO2 this decade at the summit.
Brussels also wants a swift conclusion of the law because it will influence an EU climate policy package due in June. The proposals will include tougher EU car CO2 standards, a revamp of the bloc's carbon market and new renewable energy goals - all with the aim of meeting a new 2030 emissions target.
What that target will be depends on the climate law. The Commission and EU member states want to slash net emissions at least 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels. The European Parliament wants a 60% cut. 
Negotiations have edged towards agreeing parts of the law - including a budget-like mechanism to monitor future emissions. But negotiators have not yet tackled the 2030 target, meaning the toughest talks likely lie ahead. 

EU officials said two further negotiation rounds are likely needed to finish the law, with the next scheduled for March 26.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. land borders with Canada and Mexico will remain closed to non-essential travel until at least April 21, the U.S. government said on Thursday.
The 30-day extension is the second announced under President Joe Biden and comes as U.S lawmakers in northern border states have urged lifting the nearly year-old restrictions to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a notice Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security said the three countries have all ""determined that non-essential travel ... poses additional risk of transmission and spread of the virus."" Canadian Public Safety Minister Bill Blair confirmed the extension of restrictions on Twitter.
Canada has shown little interest in lifting the restrictions and last month imposed new COVID-19 testing requirements for some Canadians returning at land crossings.
On Jan. 26, the U.S. government began requiring nearly all international air travelers to get negative COVID-19 test results within three days of travel but has no similar requirements for land border crossings.
The Biden administration has spent weeks reviewing whether to impose COVID-19 testing requirements for land border crossings but has not issued new requirements.
In an executive order in January, Biden directed U.S. officials to ""immediately commence diplomatic outreach to the governments of Canada and Mexico regarding public health protocols for land ports of entry.""
U.S. lawmakers say Americans who own property in Canada cannot maintain their homes. Border towns and businesses have been hard hit by the lack of cross-border traffic.
Hundreds of thousands of people cross the U.S.-Mexico border daily, and Mexico has extremely limited COVID-19 testing capacity, U.S. officials say.
Representative Tom Massie of Kentucky said at a March 2 hearing a vacationing Kentucky family recently tested positive in Mexico for COVID-19 and could not return to the United States on a flight.

""They flew to Tijuana, walked across the border to the United States, got on an airplane in San Diego and then returned to Kentucky,"" Massie said.

GAZA/QALQILYA (Reuters) - Sunday is Mother's Day across most of the Middle East but, for the third year running, Gaza resident Niveen Gharqoud will be forced to spend it without four of her five children.
They haven't met since 2018, when she sent them to live with their father Sami in Qalqilya, a West Bank city east of the military wall that separates Israel from the occupied Palestinian territories. 
She lives in Juhr Edeek, a village just west of a separate border fence that isolates the Gaza Strip. In between the two barriers is Israel, which she is not allowed to cross.
So the only way Gharqoud and the one child who still lives with her can bridge the 120 km (75 miles) gap is electronically.
""One hour is all I need to be with my children,"" Gharqoud said as she prepared for her Mother's Day cellphone call. ""Nothing will satisfy me but to be with my children on Mother’s Day.""
Behind the family's separation is a complex system of restrictions that Israel applies in the territories that it captured and occupied in a 1967 war.
Israel says it needs the system to protect its own citizens. Palestinians say it is unfair and arbitrary.
Gharqoud hoped the bulk of her family would be better off outside Gaza, and that she could join them later.

COGAT, Israel's military liaison to the Palestinians, said it limits to ""humanitarian-exceptional cases only"" the number of Palestinians allowed to travel to Israel and the West Bank from Gaza because the enclave is controlled by Islamist militant group Hamas.

While the UN's Sustainable Development Goals call for water and sanitation for all by 2030, the world body says water scarcity is increasing and more than half the world's population will be living in water-stressed regions by 2050.
In the run-up to the UN's World Water Day on March 22, Reuters photographers used drones to capture dramatic pictures and video of polluted waterways around the world.
In one image, a discarded sofa lies beached in the Tiete river, in Brazil's biggest city Sao Paulo, into which hundreds of tonnes of untreated sewage and waste are tipped each day.
Others show domestic waste clogging the Citarum river in Bandung, Indonesia, and sewage flowing into the Euphrates in Najaf, Iraq.
Dr Julia Brown, a human geographer specialising in environment and development at the University of Portsmouth, said many countries with water-intensive agriculture and industry lacked adequate safe drinking water.
""When we buy products and buy food and clothing we don't always appreciate that we're actually importing somebody else's water and often those countries where we're importing water from, like in avocados or our denim jeans, they're actually very water-scarce countries,"" she told Reuters.
Brown added that, while extending access to water was important, maintaining that access in some of the poorest parts of the world was often overlooked.
""NGOs like to have their photographs taken with a shiny new hand pump ... then they walk away and it's handed over to communities to raise the funds to maintain these systems, to make sure that they're repaired. And if they're not?"" she said.

""The research indicates at any one time one third of hand pumps across Sub-Saharan Africa are broken.""

MAE SOT, Thai-Myanmar border (Reuters) - Hundreds of people have fled Myanmar's towns and cities since last month's military coup and are sheltering in areas controlled by ethnic militias on the Thai border, an official from one of the groups said on Thursday, as Thailand prepared for a surge of refugees.
An official from the Karen National Union (KNU), which has been fighting the Myanmar army for decades, said almost a thousand people were sheltering inside KNU-controlled territory.
Myanmar's security forces have killed at least 217 people in their crackdown against opposition to the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a civil rights group in Myanmar.
""Hundreds of people are now in our area,"" Padoh Saw Taw Nee, the KNU's head of foreign affairs, said in an interview.
""Some are strike leaders, some are involved in CDM (civil disobedience), government staff ... deserters of police and military and then also some MPs (members of parliament) and doctors.""
He said a smaller number had also sought shelter further north, on the border with Shan state, in a region controlled by another ethnic militia.
More than two dozen ethnic armed groups are active in Myanmar's borderlands, and the KNU is among those that have condemned the coup and vowed to support the resistance. 
Padoh Saw Taw Nee said a ceasefire agreement with the government prior to the coup had become ""paralysed"". 
""We strongly support CDM movement and people's demonstration,"" he said, echoing calls for Myanmar to become a democratic federation.
A spokesman for the junta did not answer phone calls seeking comment.
Thai authorities are bracing for a surge of refugees and have set aside areas to shelter more than 43,000 people in Mae Sot district, according to plans seen by Reuters.
Thai army colonel Prasan Henprasert said border patrols had been increased.
""If there are clashes then we have to assess the situation and have areas prepared,"" he said.

""Based on our experience, many people may cross and go back when the situation is safer because they have their homes on the other side.""

In the Feb. 26 letter, which was confirmed by a U.S. official, Biden said his government is willing to work closely with Brazil on a new chapter in bilateral relations, adding that there were no limits on what the nations could achieve together, according to the Brazilian president's office. 
It did not immediately respond to a request for comment about why it waited three weeks to release the letter, which came a day after Bolsonaro's nemesis, leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, used a high-profile CNN interview to call for Biden for help in securing vaccines to end Brazil's raging coronavirus outbreak. 
Last week, Brazil's Supreme Court annulled Lula's graft convictions, upending the 2022 presidential election and teeing up a likely showdown between Lula and Bolsonaro.
Bolsonaro has been dismissive of the coronavirus and vaccines but faces growing pressure with numbers of infections and deaths reaching record highs in Brazil.
But Lula's focus on measures to end the pandemic and support Brazil's ravaged economy in a speech last week drew a swift response from Bolsonaro - he and his aides made a rare appearance wearing masks at an official event in Brasilia. 
On Friday, Bolsonaro tapped a cardiologist to become his fourth health minister during the pandemic, after months of criticism of the active army general currently in the role.
Last year's U.S. election represented a major international setback for Bolsonaro, who idolized Biden's predecessor Donald Trump and sought to build closer ties with his administration.

Biden's focus on the environment and human rights may pose a challenge for Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain who has presided over worsening destruction of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest and pushed to roll back protection of indigenous lands.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's army chief called on Thursday for arch rivals India and Pakistan to ""bury the past"" and move towards cooperation, an overture towards New Delhi that follows an unexpected joint ceasefire announcement last month between the two countries' militaries. 
General Qamar Javed Bajwa stressed however that the burden was on India to create a ""conducive environment"", and said Washington had a role to play in ending regional conflicts.
Pakistan and India, both nuclear armed countries, have fought three wars and in 2019 tensions rose dramatically when they sent combat planes into each other's territory.
""We feel it is time to bury the past and move forward,” Bajwa said in a speech at a conference in Islamabad meant to highlight the Pakistani government's new security policies. 
“But...our neighbour (India) will have to create a conducive environment, particularly in Indian-occupied Kashmir,"" he said. 
Pakistan's powerful army has ruled the country for nearly half of its 73-year existence, and the military has long controlled foreign and security policies.
India and Pakistan both control parts of the northern Kashmir region, but both claim the Himalayan region in full - which has been a source for most of the conflicts between the two.
Relations deteriorated in 2019 after Delhi stripped its part of Kashmir of the special status it long had under the Indian constitution.
Bajwa said the economic potential of South and Central Asia had ""forever remained hostage"" to the India-Pakistan disputes.
The militaries of both countries released a rare joint statement on Feb. 25 announcing a ceasefire along the disputed border in Kashmir, having exchanged fire hundreds of times in recent months.
The United States immediately welcomed the move, and encouraged the two to ""keep building on this progress"".

Bajwa said Pakistan had “hope"" in the form of President Joe Biden's new administration, which he said could help facilitate peace in the region.

The talks, which also include representatives of Pakistan and China, are designed to give a boost to negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Qatar's capital Doha, stalled lately by government accusations that the insurgents have done too little to halt violence.
""We regret that so far the efforts to launch a political process in Doha have yet to yield a positive result,"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in his opening remarks at the talks. ""We hope today's talks will facilitate the creation of conditions to achieve progress in intra-Afghan negotiations.""
U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad's presence was a sign of Washington's increasing effort to attract support among regional powers for its plans for Afghanistan, where it has agreed to withdraw its forces after nearly 20 years.
Khalilzad has been trying to drum up backing for a proposal that includes an interim government and ceasefire, as President Joe Biden reviews plans ahead of a May 1 deadline to withdraw troops agreed under his predecessor Donald Trump.
There was no immediate indication whether the U.S. participation at the talks would be affected by a separate announcement from Moscow that it was withdrawing its ambassador from Washington for consultations, following an interview in which Biden criticised President Vladimir Putin.
Moscow, which fought in Afghanistan in the 1980s, has hosted talks among Afghan sides and regional powers since 2017. Previously, Washington had largely kept its distance from the so-called ""Moscow Format"".
Arkady Dubnov, a Russian political analyst, said Khalilzad's participation would bolster Moscow's role, and ""should, according to the Russian leadership, highlight that a settlement is impossible without Russia"".
Nevertheless, an immediate breakthrough is unlikely, given the distance between the Afghan sides, said Andrew Watkins, Senior Analyst for Afghanistan at International Crisis Group. President Ashraf Ghani objects to an interim government and the Taliban have said they will not join one.
""The Taliban and the Afghan government, in particular President Ghani and his senior officials, have just as much reason to resist,"" Watkins said.

The Moscow gathering will be followed by a meeting of regional players in Turkey next month and a summit that Khalilzad has asked the United Nations to organise.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish lawmakers on Thursday legalised euthanasia and assisted suicide for people with serious and incurable or debilitating diseases who want to end their life, making Spain the fourth country in the European Union to take the step. 
The lower house of parliament's vote in a final reading was 202 in favour, 141 against and 2 abstentions. Until now, helping someone end their life in Spain carried a jail term of up to 10 years. 
""Today is an important day: we are heading towards the recognition of human rights. We are heading towards a more humane and fair society,"" Health Minister Carolina Darias told lawmakers.
The law, available for adults with legal residence in Spain, will take force in three months to give time to set up regional control committees which will review and authorise requests.
Outside the parliament, groups for and against the bill demonstrated during the debate and the vote. 
The new legislation faces staunch opposition from the hard right and religious groups. The far-right Vox party has said it will challenge the law before the Constitutional Court.
Euthanasia has long grabbed public attention in Spain, which has the world's fourth-highest life expectancy, and more notably so since paralysed man Ramon Sampedro recorded his assisted suicide in 1998 after being denied that right by courts. 
His story was taken to the screen in the Academy Award-winning 2004 film ""The Sea Inside"".
Almost 90% of Spaniards are in favour of decriminalising euthanasia, according to a 2019 opinion poll. 
Rafael Botella, a 35-year-old Spaniard paralysed from the neck down since a car crash at 19, told Reuters before the vote that he was relieved that the law would give him the option in case he needed it.
""If for some reason someone is tired of living, no one has the power to tell him, 'No, you will live because my voters or my ideology tell the contrary',"" Botella said.

Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have already legalised euthanasia. A similar plan in neighbouring Portugal suffered a setback on Monday when the country's top court rejected as unconstitutional a bill approved by parliament.

KANPUR, India (Reuters) - Sitting at plain wooden tables, women in face masks roll a brown paste into thin cylinders - helping to recycle some of the millions of tonnes of flowers that Hindu worshippers throw into the Ganges.
They are part of a 100-strong team working for entrepreneur Ankit Agarwal's Phool.co (flower), removing floral waste from one of the most polluted stretches of India's holy river in the northern city of Kanpur.
Indians typically offer flowers at temples as a mark of devotion and, Agarwal says, some eight million tonnes of those offerings end up in the country's rivers each year - along with sewage and industrial and domestic waste.
""All the pesticides and insecticides that were used to grow these flowers mix with the river water, making it highly toxic,"" he told Reuters TV.
Agarwal's team, most of whom are women, pluck out the discarded flowers near the river bank and gather them from temples to repurpose them into paper and incense - as well as water colours that can be used for the Hindu festival of Holi. 
Many Indians prefer to dump the flowers they offer to deities into water bodies as putting them into bins is considered unholy, Agarwal said. 
To discourage them from also discarding into water the packets of incense sticks his company makes, his company stamps them without images of Hindu gods and infuses the paper with basil seeds, a plant considered holy in Hinduism.
""The concept was, once we use these products, please sow the packaging and a Tulsi (basil) plant would grow out of it and the packaging really helped us establish our brand,"" he said. 
Phool.co has received investment from the social arm of the Tata business group, and most of the women he has employed used to work as manual scavengers or were jobless.
Now they have an occupation that commands respect - cleaning the sacred Ganges. 

""People see me as an independent woman who can do a job and also run her household. So, this has brought a change in my life,"" said one, Sujata Devi.

In an 800-page report into the handling of abuse cases in the archdiocese of Cologne between 1975 and 2018, criminal lawyer Bjoern Gercke said he had found more than 200 abusers and more than 300 victims in files. 
His report named the Archbishop of Hamburg Stefan Hesse and Joachim Meisner, who died in 2017 and was Woelki's predecessor as archbishop of Cologne, as having breached their duty to clear up abuse cases.
Hesse did not immediately comment on the report's findings. 
""There were years of chaos, a perceived lack of competence and misunderstanding,"" said Kerstin Stirner, one of Gercke's legal team. 
Archbishop Rainer Maria Woelki commissioned the Gercke report after refusing to allow the publication of the findings of a first investigation which he said was flawed and not legally sound. 
In an initial move, Woelki suspended two church officials, the diocese said. They were named as Auxiliary Bishop Dominikus Schwaderlapp and church official Guenter Assenmacher.
Neither commented immediately on the decision.
Critics had accused Woelki of being reluctant to conduct a full investigation and his actions have caused anger among victim groups.
Woelki said he would read the report and send it to Rome. He will hold a news conference next week on personnel consequences.
""This is a first step,"" he told reporters. ""To uncover what happened and what is happening, to clear up any cover-up and to name those responsible.""
Several German bishops have warned that the events in Cologne were damaging the Catholic Church in Germany, and the Church worldwide has for years struggled to deal with allegations of child abuse. 

Cologne, with its landmark Gothic Cathedral, has the largest membership of any diocese in the German-speaking world but for months it has been difficult to get an appointment to leave the church.

Director-General Tim Davie said the broadcaster, which is funded by a licence fee paid by TV watching households, had to deliver for the whole of Britain.
""These plans will get us closer to audiences, create jobs and investment, and develop and nurture new talent,"" he said.
Critics have said the BBC's London-centric and metropolitan viewpoint has meant it has failed to fully represent alternative views, notably in the Brexit debate.
Davie said when he started the job six months ago that the broadcaster must represent ""every part of this country"". 
Under the plan, half of the broadcaster's news teams focusing on Britain would move outside London, affecting 200 journalist jobs, the BBC said. 
Flagship news programme Newsnight will be presented from different UK bases through the year and Radio 4's Today will be co-presented from outside London for at least 100 episodes a year, it said.
Two new long-running drama series – one from the north of England and one from one of the nations - would be commissioned in the next three years, it said, and a majority of its UK-wide TV will be made outside London.
Half of its network radio and music spend would also be outside London by 2027/28, it said.
The plan, which covers the period 2022 to 2027, would result in an extra 700 million pounds ($978 million) of spending outside London, it said.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Exiled Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said on Thursday that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the United Nations were ready to mediate in any negotiations between her and the government.
""They are ready to organise a platform and act as mediators, as well as to force the regime to negotiate,"" Tsikhanouskaya said in a prerecorded video statement released on Thursday.
She said the negotiations could begin in May, with a view to holding an election in the autumn. There was no immediate comment from either the OSCE or the United Nations.
Tens of thousands of Belarusians took to the streets last year after a presidential election on Aug. 9, which President Alexander Lukashenko said he had won but Tsikhanouskaya's supporters say was stolen from her.

The protests dwindled over the winter and Lukashenko, who refused to step down despite new Western sanctions, appears to have weathered the largest challenge to his 26-year rule, buttressed by support from Moscow, which sees Belarus as a buffer against the European Union and NATO.

“Djalali’s situation is truly horrific,” the experts said. In an appeal calling on Iran to release him, they said he had been held in solitary confinement for more than 100 days, with prison officials shining bright lights in his cell round the clock to deprive him of sleep.
“Medical issues have prevented him from eating properly, resulting in dramatic weight loss,"" said the experts, who include the U.N. special rapporteurs on the situation in Iran, arbitrary executions, arbitrary detentions and torture.
""His situation is so difficult that he reportedly has trouble speaking. We are shocked and distressed by the cruel mistreatment of Mr. Djalali.”
A call to the Iranian diplomatic mission in Geneva seeking comment was not immediately returned.
Djalali, a medical doctor and lecturer at the Karolinska Institute in the Swedish capital Stockholm, was arrested in Iran in 2016 and later convicted of espionage, accused of providing information to Israel to help it assassinate nuclear scientists. Iran’s Supreme Court in 2017 upheld the death sentence. 
The U.N. experts said Djalali’s conviction and sentence were based on a confession extracted under torture and after an unfair trial. His treatment was emblematic of Iran's systematic use of solitary confinement ""to punish and pressurise detainees, including to make forced confessions,” they said. 
Rights activists have accused Iran of jailing a number of dual nationals to try to win concessions from other countries. Tehran has regularly dismissed the accusations and says its judicial system is fair.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The largest group representing exiled ethnic Uighurs has written to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urging him to demand that Beijing close its internment camps in the Xinjiang region in talks on Thursday.
Activists and U.N. experts say that more than 1 million Muslim Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims are being held against their will in harsh camps in the remote western region.
China rejects U.S. charges that it has committed genocide against ethnic and religious minorities, and says the camps provide vocational training to help stamp out Islamist extremism and separatism.
Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan are to meet China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and State Councilor Wang Yi in Alaska, in the first face-to-face meetings between the rival powers since Joe Biden became U.S. president.
Blinken has already accused China of coercion and aggression at home and around the region.
Dolkun Isa, president of the World Uyghur Congress, told Blinken: ""First and foremost, it is imperative that China immediately and unconditionally ends the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in East Turkestan.
""This includes that China closes all internment camps and unconditionally releases all those arbitrarily detained,"" he said in the letter from his group's base in Munich, Germany.
The exiles call Xinjiang ""East Turkestan"", and the group uses a different spelling for the word Uighur.
Isa said China must also end the use of forced labour in Xinjiang and other regions and allow U.N. monitors to investigate.
Chen Xu, China's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told the U.N. Human Rights Council on Monday: ""Today, Xinjiang and Tibet enjoy prosperity and stability ... It can’t be more absurd to pin the 'genocide' label on China, and this attempt will not go anywhere.""
On Wednesday, European Union countries agreed in principle to blacklist Chinese officials for human rights abuses, according to diplomats.
China has said allegations of forced labour and human rights violations in the region are groundless, and that there are no ""detention camps"".
It has also said all those who have attended the complexes in question have ""graduated"" and gone home. Access is restricted and it is not possible to verify Beijing's assertions independently.

CHISINAU (Reuters) - Moldova's parliament on Thursday nominated the country's ambassador to Russia as prime minister, in a challenge to the candidate proposed by President Maia Sandu.
The move is likely to prolong wrangling between Sandu, who became president in November on a pro-European Union ticket, and a parliament still dominated by lawmakers aligned with her pro-Russian predecessor, Igor Dodon.
Sandu has previously accused parliament of trying to sabotage her leadership and is pushing to hold a parliamentary election, which she says is needed to give her more power to fight corruption and tackle the coronavirus pandemic. 
Sandu on Tuesday nominated Igor Grosu as prime minister, prompting a constitutional challenge from lawmakers.
Corneliu Furculita, head of the parliamentary faction of Dodon's Socialist party, invited Sandu for more talks.
""The purpose of the consultations is to comply with the constitution, which stipulates that the president should consult with parliamentary factions in order to determine a candidate for prime minister,"" he said.

PENITAS, Texas (Reuters) - Mayra stepped from her hiding place in the dense brush on the banks of the Rio Grande, the river that marks the border between the United States and Mexico, as the sun came up on Wednesday morning. The 17-year-old migrant from Guatemala had her one-year-old son, Marvin, swaddled in a blanket on her back.
They had crossed the river hours earlier in the dark on small rafts with a group of about 70 migrants - mostly Guatemalan and Honduran women with young children and about 25 teenagers traveling alone. Mayra hoped that as a teen mother she would be allowed to stay in the United States.
The group is among thousands of migrants who have been crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in recent weeks, creating a political and humanitarian challenge for the new Biden administration as it tries to house the arriving migrants in government facilities during the coronavirus pandemic.
The number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border this year is on pace to be the highest in 20 years, one of U.S. President Joe Biden's top officials said this week. As of Tuesday, about 9,200 unaccompanied children were in custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the government agency that houses migrant children.
Children's clothes, shoes, and plastic water jugs littered the ground of the private ranchland in Penitas, south Texas, where Mayra's group first made landfall after crossing the river, evidence of the migrants who had crossed in the days and weeks before them.
Now, the teens and parents set out on the final leg of their journey: walking to the U.S. border wall to wait for U.S. border patrol agents to take them into custody.
Mayra made her way down the dirt road in between cotton fields on the way to the tall, imposing rusted metal slats that make up the wall. Marvin grasped at her, exhausted and crying. 
""I heard there was an opportunity to come,"" she said. ""I heard on the news that mothers with their babies and minors could come.""
When a neighbor offered to help pay for her journey, she felt she had no choice. Her father was dead and her mother's health was starting to fail. She was earning only $5 U.S. dollars per day sowing corn, sometimes taking side work washing clothes. Marvin's father had also disappeared. ""He abandoned us,"" she said through tears. ""We have nothing."" 
The group had spent the final night of their journey on the floor of an empty building on a farm near the river north of Reynosa, Mexico. ""We slept like animals,"" one young mother said.
'NOW IT'S FINALLY REAL' 
Word is spreading in Central America that minors and mothers of young children can enter the country, the migrants said, prompting them to take the weeks-long journey in buses, on foot, and in the back of trucks to arrive at the Rio Grande. 
Biden says he wants to pursue a more humane immigration policy than the hardline policies of his predecessor, President Donald Trump. He has begun to allow in children who are not traveling with a parent or legal guardian, though he has left in place a Trump-era public health order that closed the border to the vast majority of asylum seekers.
Some families with young children have also been released in recent weeks into the United States in part because the local government of Tamaulipas across from southern Texas has refused to accept their return.
Still, Biden administration officials have urged migrants not to make the dangerous journey north, stressing that the border is not open and that most people crossing the border illegally will be deported. 
Keiby, a 17-year-old Honduran, was the first among Mayra's group to arrive at the border wall. There was an open gate with no patrol agents in sight, so she walked through and sat down to rest. She had heard she could be sent to a shelter for a few weeks before rejoining her family in the United States.
She was eager to get to her mother, whom she had not seen for 14 years. ""It's been all this time,"" she said. ""Now it's finally real. Thank God.""
Members of the U.S. military arrived in a truck soon afterward and offered water bottles to the migrants. A border patrol truck pulled up and agents stepped out. ""I would say we're gonna need a bus,"" one agent said. ""It looks like there's gonna be a lot of them.""
More agents arrived, separating out the unaccompanied minors, mostly teenagers, from those traveling as families, asking each migrant their age and nationality.
""You sure you're a minor?"" one asked a woman who said she was nearly 18. She looked older, he said, and it would be better for her to tell the truth now. She rummaged through her bag for a piece of paper that would prove her age.
Border patrol lined up the minors likely to be traveling without legal guardians against trucks and vans and sat the families up against the wall. They took down the children's information, handing them bags to place their belongings in and instructing them to remove their shoelaces.
At the end of the line of minors stood Mayra, consoling her young son with a blue toy car. Overwhelmed and in tears, she nursed Marvin and waited for border patrol agents to approach her.
""I hope they'll let me go to my sister,"" she said.

She has family in New York and is eager to start a life there, to provide for her child and send money back to her mother in Guatemala to buy the medicine she needs.

The announcement came a day after the World Health Organization backed the vaccine and as more than a dozen European countries have suspended the use of it amid concerns over the risk of blood clots.
John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a news conference that the ""benefits still outweigh the risks"" and that countries should ""move forward"" with the vaccination.
AstraZeneca said on Sunday a review of safety data of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the United Kingdom and European Union with its vaccine had shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.
The head of the continent's disease control body said that adverse reactions would be monitored and reported for future assessments on the vaccine.
Some African countries have already suspended use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
On Friday the Democratic Republic of Congo delayed the rollout of the shot, citing the suspension of the use of the shots by European countries. 
Many African states expect to receive AstraZeneca shots from the COVAX Facility, a global vaccine allocation plan co-led by the World Health Organization and partners including the Gavi vaccines alliance, which will be delivering vaccines for free to some low and lower-middle-income countries.

The European Medicines Agency is investigating reports of 30 cases of unusual blood disorders out of 5 million people who got the AstraZeneca vaccine in the EU. It said it has so far found no causal link.

MADRID (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Germans are planning last-minute Easter getaways to Spain's sun-kissed islands, leaving many Spaniards, who are not allowed to do the same because of a travel ban, upset.
""It makes absolutely no sense that in Spain we can't move between regions but any foreigner can come in ... and spread infection,"" said Emilio Rivas, 23, who lives in Madrid.
The young tax assessor wanted to get out of town for the holidays but must instead stay home because Spain banned travel between regions over Easter to avoid a repeat of a spike in contagion seen after an easing in restrictions over Christmas. 
But tourists from European countries with higher infection rates like France or Germany can fly in for a holiday as long as they have a negative covid test result - something even top health official Fernando Simon described as ""incongruous.""
As soon as Berlin last week lifted a quarantine requirement for travellers returning from the Balearic islands, demand for flights to the archipelago soared, with tourists from France and elsewhere also conspicuous on the streets of Madrid. 
The German government still advises against non-essential travel, however. ""The lack of a travel warning is not an invitation to travel,"" a foreign ministry spokeswoman said earlier this week.
Retired Madrid resident Angelines Ruiz complained of having to stay put after cancelling a trip to the western region of Extremadura.
""On top of that I'm afraid of going anywhere in case I get infected by one of these French or Germans,"" said Ruiz, 76.
Spain's infection rate is at its lowest since August. 
NO FREE BOOZE
Despite widespread grumbling from Spaniards, the return of sun-seeking Germans will provide a welcome shot in the arm to the ailing tourism industry after foreign visitors to Spain fell 80% to 19 million in 2020, the lowest level since 1969.
In 2020 the industry's contribution to gross domestic product tumbled to between 4% and 5%, according to estimates from the Funcas think-tank from a 12% share in 2019. 
Hotels and holiday lets in Germany are barred from renting to tourists, leaving foreign vacations as the only option. 
Lufthansa's low-cost Eurowings airline added 300 extra flights from all over Germany to Mallorca for Easter in response to a fourfold jump in bookings after the quarantine lifting, while Ryanair announced 200 extra connections to Mallorca and Alicante. 
TUI Germany, said Easter bookings were double 2019 levels and some of the company's Mallorca hotels were already fully booked.
Communications chief at TUIfly Aage Duenhaupt said the influx would not lead to rowdiness, and nightclubs in German resorts would remain closed. 
""There won't be the party holidays,"" he said. ""They have even cancelled the free alcohol in the all-inclusive hotels.""
Responding to the sudden surge in bookings, Balearic authorities said they welcomed the new wave of tourists and would strictly enforce the requirement for a negative PCR test.
""It is not a problem that people come to the Balearic Islands. We test everyone and will continue to do so as long as health security requires,"" a health department spokeswoman said. 
At Duesseldorf airport, travellers heading to the Balearics were sympathetic with Spaniards' discontent. 

""I can understand totally how the Spanish feel, to travel in corona times is really a privilege,"" said Mallorca-bound passenger Donata, who did not give her second name. ""The whole thing is a bit irresponsible.""

397,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 06:11AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why more migrant children are arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border,"By Ted Hesson and Mica Rosenberg
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border this year is on pace to be the highest in 20 years, one of U.S. President Joe Biden's top officials said this week, a rise that includes an increase in unaccompanied children. 
The Biden administration has struggled to house the growing number of children arriving without a parent or legal guardian, which has left the kids stuck in jail-like border facilities for days. Republicans have blamed Biden for relaxing immigration policies, while some Democrats are concerned about conditions in facilities and why children are being held for so long.
Biden, a Democrat who took office on Jan. 20, pledged to reverse many of the hard-line border policies of his Republican predecessor, former President Donald Trump. But less than two months into his presidency, he is dealing with an emerging humanitarian and political crisis.
WHO ARE THE UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN ARRIVING AT THE BORDER?
About two-thirds of unaccompanied children caught at the border since Oct. 1, 2020, have been from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Mexican children make up most of the remainder. 
As of Tuesday, about 9,200 unaccompanied children were in the custody of a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) refugee office that manages a government shelter system for the kids - the highest number since 2019.
Most of the kids in custody are teenagers, but hundreds are under 12 years old. The majority of unaccompanied children apprehended since Oct. 1, 2020, crossed through Texas' Rio Grande Valley, according to CBP.
WHY ARE SO MANY KIDS COMING TO THE BORDER?
Many unaccompanied children come to the United States to reunite with family members or escape violence and poverty in their home countries, according to immigration experts.
Central America has recently been battered by hurricanes and slumping economies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has spurred more migration.
Republicans argue Biden has encouraged illegal immigration by rolling back Trump's policies. But border arrests have been gradually rising since a sharp decline in April 2020 as countries shut borders due to the pandemic.
Biden told ABC in an interview on Tuesday that it was nonsense that more migrants were coming because he is ""a nice guy,"" saying ""they come because their circumstance is so bad."" 
Biden officials and migrant advocates, however, acknowledge that the current increase is at least partly due to a recent policy change that now allows unaccompanied children into the country. 
The Biden administration continues to expel single adults and families crossing illegally, with some exceptions.
There were similar spikes in 2019 and 2014 under Trump and former President Barack Obama, respectively. Graphic https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-IMMIGRATION/BORDER/xklpyoalapg/index.html
ARE THE CHILDREN TRULY UNACCOMPANIED?
Some children do make the potentially dangerous trip to the border alone or with a smuggler, according to immigration experts. But in other cases, children travel with older siblings, grandparents or other relatives, and can be split apart by CBP after being caught at the border.
Currently, immigrant advocates are concerned that parents may be traveling to the border with their children and sending them to the United States alone so that they will be permitted to enter.
If the parents and children entered as a family, they could be expelled under Title 42, a Trump-era health order to limit the spread of COVID-19.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A CHILD ARRIVES AT THE BORDER?
Children are supposed to be transferred out of CBP custody to HHS-run shelters within 72 hours.
But when shelter space is limited, children can get stuck in border detention centers for longer periods - as is happening now.
The border stations were built to house adult men for short periods and could pose a COVID-19 health risk to children and staff if they are overcrowded.
Once in the shelters, children can be released to parents or other sponsors, or placed in foster care. They can then pursue asylum cases, seek other ways to remain in the United States or potentially be deported - although that is unlikely to happen quickly.
The United States removed only 4% of the roughly 290,000 unaccompanied children who entered the country from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2019, according to U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data.
WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS IN BORDER PATROL FACILITIES?
CBP facilities are not open to the public. But lawyers representing children in a decades-old class action lawsuit visited a facility in Donna, Texas, on March 11.
They found the facility packed with about 1,800 children, some as young as 1, said Leecia Welch, one of the lawyers, with conditions that suggested it was ""vastly over capacity.""
Several children described sleeping on the floor or on metal benches, she said. The children were only allowed outside a few minutes every few days.
""They wanted fresh air and to see the sky,"" Welch said.
WHAT IS THE U.S. DOING TO DEAL WITH THE INCREASE?
The Biden administration is creating joint processing centers to transfer the children promptly into HHS custody after they arrive at the border, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said on Tuesday.
The administration has opened several emergency shelters for children in Texas and plans to use the Dallas convention center to house up to 3,000 migrant teen boys.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) - which usually responds to floods, storms and other major disasters - was deployed on Saturday to help shelter and transport children at least until early June.
In the longer-term, Biden is trying to establish programs that allow Central Americans to apply for refugee status in the United States from their home countries and improve conditions in those countries.
As part of that effort, the administration announced the restart of a program that allows certain Central American children with parents lawfully living in the United States to apply for a refugee resettlement from their home countries.

Biden has pledged to push for $4 billion in U.S. aid for Central America to help address the factors that drive migration, such as poverty and crime.

Pashinyan has faced calls to resign since last November when he agreed to a Russian-brokered ceasefire that halted six weeks of fighting between ethnic Armenian and Azeri forces over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
Interfax quoted Environment Minister Romanos Petrosyan, a member of Pashinyan's party, on the election decision.
""We're preparing for snap elections. I think today or tomorrow the decision will be announced as well as the date,"" Petrosyan said. 
The army told Pashinyan to quit on Feb. 25, prompting the prime minister to sack the chief of the army's general staff. But Armenia's president declined to approve Pashinyan's move and the general's lawyer said on Thursday he remained in his post.
The standoff is a major challenge for Pashinyan, who was swept to power by protests in 2018 but has been under fire over his handling of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
The November deal secured significant territorial gains for Azerbaijan in and around Nagorno-Karabakh. The enclave is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but is populated and until recently was fully controlled by ethnic Armenians.

Pashinyan said he had been compelled to agree to the peace deal to prevent greater human and territorial losses.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The United States and Europe have criticised a move by Turkey towards banning the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), a week before EU leaders are due to discuss strained relations with Ankara at a summit. 
A Turkish prosecutor filed a case with the constitutional court on Wednesday demanding a ban on the HDP over alleged ties to Kurdish militants, the culmination of a years-long crackdown against the third largest party in parliament.
The move marks the revival of a long history of Turkey banning political parties, including pro-Kurdish ones.
The U.S. State Department said dissolving the HDP ""would unduly subvert the will of Turkish voters, further undermine democracy  in Turkey, and deny millions of Turkish citizens their chosen representation"".
The prosecutor's announcement of the case came on the same day that Turkey's parliament stripped a prominent HDP deputy of his parliamentary status.
""Unapologetically (moving) towards the end of pluralism. What reaction does Turkey expect now from the European Union? A positive agenda?"" said Nacho Sanchez Amor, the European Parliament's rapporteur on Turkey, which is a candidate for EU membership though accession talks have been stalled for years.
TIES TO PKK MILITANTS
The HDP had recently come under intensified pressure, with nationalist allies of President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party calling for it to be banned over alleged ties to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group.
That coincided with falling poll support for the AKP and its nationalist allies as they battle the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Elections are not scheduled until 2023.
Presidential communications director Fahrettin Altun said in the first government reaction it was ""an indisputable fact that HDP has organic ties to PKK"", noting Turkey, the United States and the European Union consider it a terrorist organisation.
""HDP's senior leaders and spokespeople, through their words and deeds, have repeatedly and consistently proved that they are the PKK's political wing,"" he said.
Devlet Bahceli, leader of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), also hailed the move: ""The HDP is a criminal organisation disguised in a political cloak. It is a historic and moral duty for it to be shut and never to be reopened under another name.""
The HDP has said it would regroup in a new party if banned, though the Haberturk news website cited the indictment as saying the prosecutor demanded a political ban for more than 600 HDP officials - a severe obstacle to any such move.
The HDP, which won 11.7% of the vote in a 2018 parliamentary election and has 55 seats in the 600-member parliament, accused the AKP of shaping politics through the courts. It denies any links to the militants.

The PKK has fought an insurgency against the state in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey since 1984. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

401,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 04:20AM ET</span>",Tanzania's COVID sceptic leader Magufuli dies of heart disease,"(Reuters) - Tanzania's leadership faced calls for a smooth succession on Thursday after president John Magufuli, Africa's most vehement coronavirus sceptic, died from heart disease following an 18-day absence from public life that drew speculation about his health.
An opposition leader urged the immediate swearing in of vice president Samia Suluhu Hassan as successor, saying that would avoid a constitutional vacuum and prevent uncertainty. 
Magufuli's death, the first of a Tanzanian leader while in office, opens the prospect that the country will gain its first female president. 
The constitution says Hassan, 61, should assume the presidency for the remainder of the five-year term that Magufuli began serving last year after winning a second term. 
Hassan addressed the nation on television late on Wednesday, saying Magufuli had died from the heart disease that had plagued him for a decade. She said burial arrangements were under way for the 61-year-old leader but did not indicate when she would be sworn in.
Government spokesman Hassan Abbasi did not respond to calls and texts seeking comment on succession plans.
Magufuli had not been seen in public since Feb. 27, sparking rumours he had COVID-19. On March 12, officials denied he had fallen ill and on Monday Hassan had urged Tanzanians not to listen to rumours from outside the country.
As late as Wednesday, she sent 'greetings' from Magufuli in a remarks to an audience in the coastal region of Tanga.
""The VP has to be sworn in immediately,"" opposition leader Zitto Kabwe told Reuters by phone from Dar es Salaam. ""The constitution doesn't allow a vacuum ... I will be concerned if the day passes without her being sworn in.""
A source who advises businesses operating in Tanzania said “The next 48 hours are crucial ... There is likely to be uncertainty. Some people will want to purge some Magufuli hardliners, but given how he restructured the intelligence services, that is easier said than done.”
OPPOSITION
Nicknamed ""The Bulldozer"" because of his reputation for pushing through policies despite opposition, Magufuli drew international criticism for his unorthodox and increasingly authoritarian tactics. 
Although Hassan publicly championed Magufuli's leadership style and frequently represented him abroad, she has been more soft spoken and less confrontational than the president.
“The Vice President hasn’t given the impression of significant popularity or influence within the (ruling party),"" said Fergus Kell, Africa analyst at the Chatham House think-tank in London. ""This could throw up some potential challenges in terms of managing competing interests and generating the required support within the ruling party to govern effectively.”
Magufuli was a vocal COVID-19 sceptic who urged Tanzanians to shun mask-wearing and denounced vaccines as a Western conspiracy, frustrating the World Health Organization.
Traffic moved normally on Thursday morning and there was not a heavy security presence in Dar es Salaam, the country's biggest city, a Reuters witness said. 
Some people stood on street corners in the downtown area reading newspapers including a headline blaring ""Grief"" and wept. As has been the case throughout the pandemic in Tanzania, many people were not wearing face masks.
Tundu Lissu, Magufuli's main rival in the October election when the president won a second term, said in an interview with Kenya's KTN that it was time for the country to open a new chapter after Magufuli ""caused havoc to our country."" 

East African governments offered condolences, but some people from the region were critical of his stance on COVID-19 and his leadership style. ""It has been a horrendous 5 years in #Tanzania,"" tweeted Tanzanian lawyer Fatma Karume.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte will begin initial talks to form a new government on Thursday, after a national election dominated by the coronavirus pandemic in which his conservative VVD party was projected to secure a fourth consecutive win.
With 63% of Wednesday's vote counted, Rutte's party was on track to take 36 out of 150 seats in the lower house. 
Rutte said a new coalition with the left-leaning pro-European D-66 party, led by former U.N. diplomat Sigrid Kaag, which is projected to make the biggest gains and finish in second place with 24 seats, ""would seem obvious"".
The result was an endorsement of Rutte's handling of the pandemic, even though infection rates remain high and the rollout of vaccination has been slow. But with the unexpected strength of D-66, which did better than opinion polls had forecast, it was also an endorsement of the political centre.
""Dutch people are not extreme, they are moderate,"" a beaming Kaag said after the initial exit poll was broadcast on Wednesday, calling her run a ""crazy adventure"".
On the far right, the anti-Islam Freedom Party of Geert Wilders lost seats, as did the environmentalist Green Party on the left.
Rutte, who has been prime minister since 2010, currently leads a caretaker government with the Christian Democrats and D-66, the two parties that are likely to help form the core of his new coalition.
He said his first priority would be to continue managing the pandemic: ""The challenges ahead of us are enormous. In the coming weeks and months, we need to lead the country out of the coronavirus crisis.""
Rutte said he hoped to build a new coalition as quickly as possible, given the urgency of the pandemic and other challenges facing the country. An initial meeting of party heads is scheduled for Thursday afternoon.
The Netherlands is one of the first major European Union economies to hold elections during the COVID-19 crisis, and voting was held over three days to reduce the risk of infection.

The virus has killed more than 16,000 people in the nation of 17 million. Despite the pandemic, turnout was 83%, about as high as four years ago.

The bill, which included a plan for an elected committee to rewrite the constitution, was far short of the votes in a joint session late on Wednesday of the elected lower house and the junta-appointed Senate. 
Thailand's government agreed to consider amending the constitution after a youth-led protest movement started in July to demand changes to the 2017 charter, which they said was designed to keep Prime Minister and former coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha in office and cement the military's role in politics. 
The movement wants to oust Prayuth, who said the 2019 election was free and fair under a constitution that was approved in a referendum.
The protesters have also demanded curbs to the power of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who is ""enthroned in a position of revered worship"" according to the constitution and protected by a strict lese majeste law that mandates up to 15 years in prison for insulting the monarchy.
In November, lawmakers considered seven options for changing the constitution but adopted only two, which would allow for discussion of constitutional change without affecting the monarchy. 
A proposal that would have opened the way for discussion of the king's role, a longstanding taboo in Thailand, failed to win enough votes for approval. 
Thailand's Constitutional Court last week ruled that parliament can form a committee to rewrite the constitution, but two referendums must be held: one to ask the public if it wants a re-write, then another to approve the draft once completed.

No proposals for the first referendum have been drafted so far.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Both pressure and diplomatic options are on the table for dealing with North Korea, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday, hours after a senior North Korean diplomat rejected any talks until Washington changed its policies.
Blinken told a joint briefing with South Korean officials in Seoul that the administration of President Joe Biden would complete its review of North Korea policy in the next few weeks in close consultation with its allies.
""President Biden plans to complete a North Korea policy review in the weeks ahead in close cooperation and consultation with the Republic of Korea, with Japan and with other key partners, including resuming pressure options and the potential for future diplomacy,"" Blinken said. 
He declined to elaborate when asked what approach the United States would take after the review. 
But when asked at a separate online roundtable with Korean journalists if Biden would meet Kim, Blinken said Washington is exploring how to convince North Korea to make progress on denuclearisation by considering both ""different kinds of pressure points"" and diplomacy. 
""In a sense, everything is on the table. We have a very open mind about it,"" he said. 
The comments came hours after North Korean official Choe Son Hui called the Biden administration's attempts to contact Pyongyang a ""cheap trick"", in Pyongyang's first public statement on the matter.
Blinken was making his first visit to South Korea as secretary of state, alongside U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.
They issued a joint statement with their South Korean counterparts, Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong and Defense Minister Suh Wook, vowing to work together on regional issues from climate change and the coronavirus pandemic to trade and North Korea.
""The ministers and secretaries emphasised that North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile issues are a priority for the alliance, and reaffirmed a shared commitment to address and resolve these issues,"" they said in the statement.
'WIDESPREAD, SYSTEMATIC ABUSES'
While the joint statement largely focused on shared concerns and interests, the briefing showed potential sources of future policy discord on North Korea and China. 
Blinken said its North Korea strategy would not only address security concerns but also the ""repressive"" North Korean government's ""widespread, systematic abuses"" on its people. 
Activists have accused the administration of South Korean President Moon Jae-in and former U.S. President Donald Trump of overlooking the North Korean human rights issue as they sought to improve ties and pursued summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
""The goals of this policy are clear: we're committed to the denuclearisation of North Korea, reducing the broader threat the DPRK poses to the United States and our allies, and improving the lives of all Koreans,"" Blinken said.
Moon has called for Biden to build on progress made by Kim and Trump from their unprecedented summit in Singapore in 2018, which Chung said could provide the groundwork for future talks between Washington and Pyongyang. 
""We think the Singapore agreement deserves sufficient consideration as it has basic principles for improving North Korea-U.S. relations, establishing peace and achieving denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula,"" Chung told the briefing. 
Blinken also blamed China at the briefing for undermining regional stability and security with its ""aggressive and authoritarian behaviour,"" and stressed its role in convincing North Korea to denuclearise. 
Beijing has rebuked Blinken's similar remarks in Tokyo, and his renewed criticism came ahead of his first in-person meetings with Chinese counterparts in Alaska on Thursday. 
Blinken called for unity among allies, despite Seoul's hesitance to provoke China, its largest economic partner and an ally of North Korea. 

""It is more important than ever that we stand together for the values for the interest that unite us,"" he said.

The blast hit a bus which was rented by the Afghan Ministry of Information and Technology to transport employees, said Abdul Samad Hamid Poya, a ministry adviser.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Ifa Hanifah Misbach was 19 when her father died - and her family told her he would not go to heaven because she refused to wear the hijab, a Muslim head covering. 
Misbach now works as a psychologist in Bandung, West Java, where she has counselled dozens of Indonesian girls who have been ostracised, bullied and threatened with explusion from school because they too declined to wear the veil.
""The impact of religious pressures, especially to wear the jilbab, when you’re young, makes it feel like you have no breathing room,"" Misbach said, using the word for hijab more commonly used in Indonesia, in a report by Human Rights Watch. ""I wanted to run away."" 
The 45-year-old's experience is one of many shared by women and girls in the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, including cases of girls being expelled from school.
Indonesia's ideology enshrines religious diversity and the country has significant Christian, Hindu, Buddhist and other minorities, but religious conservatism and growing intolerance of beliefs other than Islam has been rising over the past two decades.
Women and girls across the country can face ""intense and constant"" pressure to wear the hijab, said Human Rights Watch Indonesia researcher Andreas Harsono, which the rights body described as an assault on basic rights to freedom of religion, expression and privacy. 
""Wearing a jilbab should be a choice, it should not be a mandatory regulation,"" Harsono told Reuters. ""There is a growing belief all over Indonesia that if you are a Muslim woman and you don’t wear the hijab you are less pious; you are morally less.""
Human Rights Watch identified more than 60 discriminatory local, provincial bylaws issued since 2001 to enforce female dress codes. A 2014 national government regulation has been widely interpreted as requiring all female Muslim students in the country of around 270 million people to wear a jilbab at school. 
""Indonesian state schools use a combination of psychological pressure, public humiliation, and sanctions to persuade girls to wear the hijab,"" said the report. 
One Muslim highschooler, who asked to remain anonymous, recalled being told at age 12 by two of her classmates that she should wear the hijab as ""one strand of hair that is shown is equal to one step closer towards hell"". 
There has been some pushback. The case of a Christian schoolgirl in West Sumatra who was forced to wear the hijab sparked a national outcry last month, leading the education and religious affairs ministry to issue a decree banning public schools from making religious attire mandatory.
Indonesia's main rights body, Komnas HAM, said the decree supported the right to religious choice, but it remains unclear how strictly it will be enforced.
Human Rights Watch found the problems extended well beyond school, reporting cases of female civil servants and lecturers who resigned from their jobs due to pressure to wear the hijab, and others who were unable to access government services because they chose not to veil.

A spokesman for the Education Ministry did not respond specifically to questions about the report, referring Reuters to its recent decree. The religious affairs ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In speeches, policy documents, and other communications, senior leaders including Secretary of State Antony Blinken have regularly adopted the phrase in a break from the ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"".
The ""peninsula"" wording has been used for a decade in many United Nations Security Council resolutions and international agreements, including the declaration signed by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and former U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in 2018.
Blinken did not respond to a question about the wording during a briefing in Seoul on Thursday, but his South Korean counterpart, Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong said emphasising the peninsula was ""more correct"", highlighting a possible point of difference between the two allies.
""It means that to North Korea we are showing that South Korea has already denuclearised... that we have to go along together,"" Chung said. ""If we can say 'denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,' we are more confident that we can convince North Korea to follow our suit."" 
The night before, South Korea's Ministry of Defense said the allies had ""reaffirmed the common goal of denuclearising the Korean Peninsula"", while the Pentagon said they ""noted a commitment to supporting diplomatic efforts to achieve the denuclearisation of North Korea.""
The U.S. change in wording has not been universal, with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin using both phrases during his visit to Seoul with Blinken this week.
But experts and Western diplomatic sources said the new emphasis is deliberate and will be noted.
""On an issue where words are carefully parsed, this is a noticeable shift from 'denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula' which was the norm in the Obama years,"" Ben Rhodes, who served as Deputy National Security Advisor under former President Barack Obama, said on Twitter.
'LUNATIC THEORY' 
Implications of unilateral denuclearisation are ""a nonstarter for Pyongyang and is unlikely to jumpstart any negotiations,"" said Vipin Narang, a nuclear affairs expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States.
""The formulation 'denuclearisation of North Korea' implies unilateral obligations on North Korea - something it has never agreed to, and neither have we,"" he said. 
In a statement on Thursday, a senior North Korean diplomat blasted the Biden administration's talk of complete denuclearisation as a ""lunatic theory"" that needed to be dropped before talks could resume.
Conflicting or vague views of what denuclearisation means have complicated negotiations that have largely been stalled since 2019.
In 2018, North Korea defined ""denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"" as ""removing all elements of nuclear threats from the areas of both the north and the south of Korea and also from surrounding areas from where the Korean peninsula is targeted.""
That has been interpreted as the United States withdrawing its troops from South Korea and ending its ""nuclear umbrella"" security alliance with Seoul, among other conditions.
Washington, meanwhile, has insisted on complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantling of North Korea's nuclear weapons and the facilities needed to build them. The United States has never publicly said it would reduce its own military presence in return, and regularly stresses its commitment to defending South Korea.
Duyeon Kim, with the U.S.-based Center for a New American Security, said the wording around denuclearisation is only a big deal if Pyongyang makes it an issue.

""It would be silly and a missed opportunity for Pyongyang if phraseology on denuclearisation in American public comments and statements became deal breakers before any meaningful talks even take place with the Biden administration,"" she said.

412,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 10:25PM ET</span>",U.S. prosecutors seek life for Honduran president's brother on drug trafficking conviction,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors will seek life in prison next week for the brother of the sitting Honduran president and former Honduran congressman, Juan Antonio Tony Hernandez, who was convicted of drug trafficking and related weapons charges in October 2019.
In a filing in federal court in Manhattan, prosecutors said Tony Hernandez ""played a leadership role in a violent, state sponsored drug trafficking conspiracy,"" along with his brother President Juan Orlando Hernandez.
President Hernandez has denied the allegations and he has not been charged with a crime. 
In addition to a life term for Tony Hernandez when he is sentenced on Tuesday in New York, prosecutors will seek a fine of $10 million and $138 million dollars in forfeiture, which prosecutors wrote was ""blood money"" from drug trafficking.
Hernandez's lawyers have not yet filed a response to the government's sentencing memorandum.
""The defendant trafficked cocaine on a monumental scale, corrupted his elected office, contributed to the already deteriorating conditions in Honduras, and repeatedly lied to the Court,"" the prosecutors wrote.
The filing says that in addition to corrupting institutions to transport at least 185,000 kilograms of cocaine to the United States, he commanded members of Honduran security forces, controlled drug laboratories, sold machine guns and ammunition, some from the military, to drug traffickers, and helped cause two murders. 
""Between 2004 and 2019, the defendant secured and distributed millions of dollars in drug-derived bribes to Juan Orlando Hernandez, former Honduran President Porfirio Lobo Sosa and other politicians associated with Honduras's National Party,"" prosecutors said, highlighting that he took a $1 million bribe for his brother from Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. 
President Hernandez has often represented himself as tough on drugs, acting as an ally to the United States under both the Obama and Trump administrations, in immigration and anti-narcotics operations.
The allegations could complicate the efforts of the new U.S. administration of President Joe Biden to address the causes of migration from Central America by investing $4 billion in the region, including Honduras.
In January thousands of Hondurans joined one of the largest-ever migrant caravans hoping to reach the United States, with many citing rampant violence, government corruption, and worsening poverty as their reasons for leaving.
In an indictment in a current case against alleged Honduran drug trafficker Geovanny Fuentes Ramirez, prosecutors said that Hernandez, who has been president since 2014, used Honduran law enforcement and military officials to protect drug traffickers.

Hernandez denies the allegations.

Both countries have been successful in largely containing the spread of the coronavirus domestically. 
Australia's border has been mostly open to neighbouring New Zealanders since last October, with a few short suspensions when there were small coronavirus outbreaks in Auckland. But New Zealand has delayed returning the favour amid more frequent bursts of fresh COVID-19 clusters across Australia. 
""We were working towards a joint framework, a joint set of protocols, but actually I don't think we're too far off being able to create the New Zealand version to match up with the Australian version,"" New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson told Radio New Zealand (RNZ).
Robertson said there were still a few issues to be finalised, such as how travellers would be dealt with in the event of new outbreaks. 
RNZ reported plans were in place to have the arrangement operational by the end of April. 
Pressure has been mounting on Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government to allow Australians entry. Opposition National Party leader Judith Collins warned this week that Ardern could ""end up with the death of Queenstown on her"". 
Queenstown, a popular destination for international tourists, relies heavily on Australian visitors during the ski season from June to October.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said last week a two-way travel arrangement was in New Zealand's hands.

""If the New Zealand government doesn't wish Australians to visit New Zealand and spend money in Queenstown or Wellington or other parts of the country, that's a matter for them,"" he told reporters.

In an editorial, the paper described policy in Xinjiang as no different from what Western countries have done to fight terrorism, and called claims of genocide or forced labour in the region ""politically motivated to disadvantage China.""
The piece then warns that China will do ""whatever it considers appropriate to retaliate,"" if the European Union carries out any sanctions against Chinese officials.
The piece's unnamed author also urged the EU to not link its investment treaty with human rights issues.
""The deal is in the interests of both sides and politicizing a deal that has taken years for both sides to agree on will only deal a heavy blow to the otherwise amicable bilateral relations,"" the paper wrote.
On Wednesday, EU ambassadors approved the travel bans and asset freezes on four Chinese individuals and one entity over engaging in human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The names of the sanctioned parties will not be made public until March 22.

415,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 08:27PM ET</span>","For Asian-Americans, Atlanta shooting sows fresh fear after a year of mounting discrimination","By Rich McKay and Gabriella Borter
ATLANTA (Reuters) - Before the COVID-19 pandemic began last year, Kyung Cho noticed people sometimes gave him odd looks or asked if he spoke English.
These days, Cho said, attitudes toward Asian-Americans like him have become far more hostile.
""It's gotten worse,"" the 50-year-old handyman said as he shopped at an Asian grocery store in an Atlanta suburb on Wednesday. ""The other day I was in a parking lot and some kid shouted for me to go back to China. I'm from Korea.""
Across the United States, many Asian-Americans reeled at the news of a shooting spree at three spas in and around Atlanta on Tuesday night that left eight people dead, including six Asian women. Authorities said the 21-year-old white male suspect told them he had a sex addiction and that the attacks may not have had a racial motivation.
But after a year in which reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans have skyrocketed, the shooting sparked fresh outrage, fear and demands for a government response.
""We're besieged,"" said Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University and a founder of Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition that has tracked anti-Asian violence during the pandemic. ""The overall community is traumatized.""
In a report released on Tuesday before the shooting, the coalition said it received 3,795 reports of hate incidents between March 2020 and February 2021. The majority of the discrimination consisted of verbal harassment and shunning, with women reporting incidents about two times more often then men.
A study published earlier this month by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, a nonpartisan research center, showed that reported hate crimes against Asian Americans in 16 major U.S. cities rose by 149% from 2019 to 2020, while overall hate crimes dropped 7% in the same time period. 
Advocates for the community say the surge is largely the result of Asian Americans being blamed for the coronavirus, which was first identified in Wuhan, China in late 2019. Former U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the ""China Virus"" and ""kung flu,"" rhetoric seen by some as inflaming anti-Asian sentiment.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll of 4,430 Americans, conducted from Feb. 18-24, showed that 37% believed that COVID-19 was created in a lab in China, including 24% of Democrats and 54% of Republicans. Researchers are still trying to identify the origins of the virus, but there is no credible evidence to suggest it was accidentally released from a Chinese lab. 
Lily Huynh, 24, said she was upset by the deaths of the women in Georgia.
She said she has increasingly worried that her mother, an immigrant from Vietnam who owns a nail salon in Mesquite, Texas, might be targeted due to her heavy accent and nationality.
""You think about these women, and you recognize your own mother could have been them,"" Huynh said.
Asian-American leaders on Wednesday called for government officials to do more to protect and support their communities, and the hashtag #StopAsianHate circulated widely on social media. A U.S. House of Representatives committee planned a hearing for Thursday to address the issue.
""Asian Americans are afraid to leave their homes, and not just because of disease. They're afraid to leave their homes because there's a real risk, just walking down the street minding your own business, that you'll be blamed for a global pandemic and that people will come after you,"" said Frank Wu, the president of Queens College, City University of New York, who studies anti-Asian discrimination in the United States.
Almost half of the anti-Asian hate incidents recorded by Stop AAPI Hate occurred in California, where Asian Americans make up some 15% of the population. 
Ronald Lisam, a 45-year-old Chinese-American who was grocery shopping in San Francisco's Chinatown on Wednesday, said he has started to question his safety in public. 

""Every day I'm worried about being attacked, robbed, assaulted,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin met virtually on Wednesday with 22 college students who will retrace the journey of Black abolitionist Frederick Douglass to Ireland 175 years ago to escape slavery.
The students won competitive scholarships for a month of study this summer in Ireland, where Douglass spent four months in 1845 and where his legacy endures.
Martin told the students that Douglass, then 27, described his time in Ireland as among the happiest of his life because he was treated not ""as a color but as a man - not as a thing, but as a child of the common Father of us all.""
Harris said Douglass' time in Ireland allowed him to feel truly free for the first time.
""You are walking in great footsteps,"" she said. ""I'm counting on all of you to live up to that potential.""
The program, coordinated by the Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE) and co-sponsored by the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, is supported by Nettie Washington Douglass, the great-great-granddaughter of Frederick Douglass.
She said the warm welcome her ancestor received across Ireland affected him profoundly. ""I can think of no better place for future American leaders to gain a global perspective and prepare to be agents of change,"" she told the students.
Brielle Smith, a student at Howard University, the alma mater of Harris, said in an interview that it went ""beyond my wildest imaginations"" to meet Harris and the Irish prime minister.

""One of my dream jobs is as press secretary in the Department of State, and being able to see that literally tells me that the doors are opening, and I just think it's amazing,"" she said.

A deepening economic and political crisis in the poorest country in the Americas has led to a surge in kidnappings and murders as gangs have gained power, turning ever more areas of the capital and other cities into no-go areas.
Masked, heavily-armed members of the Fantom 509 group, who describe themselves as disaffected police officers and ex-officers, told local media they believed their colleagues had been unjustly detained in a Port-au-Prince police station.
The police had no immediate comment on the incident or why the officers had been detained. Lawyers for the officers said in a statement they were victims of the politicization of Haiti's police force and the failures of its justice system.
The Fantom 509 members said they were also protesting the fact authorities had not recovered the bodies of four policemen who died last Friday in a botched attack on a gang stronghold where kidnapping victims are often held. 
Trainee police officers joined in the jail break while citizens took to the street for a fifth day to block roads with vehicles, debris and burning tires, also vandalizing a car dealership.
President Jovenel Moise declared on Wednesday a state of emergency in the worst gang-controlled areas for one month in order to allow state security forces to regain control of the situation.
Critics accuse the government of not sufficiently equipping the police to confront gangs, even if it has slightly raised its budget for the police this year.

They also accuse it of fostering gang activity either by design, to intimidate opponents, or simply by inaction. Gang leaders or even former government officials implicated in massacres in opposition strongholds have not been arrested.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday appointed veteran French diplomat Jean Arnault as his personal envoy on Afghanistan and regional issues.
The appointment comes a day before Russia, China, the United States, Pakistan, a delegation of top Afghan officials and opposition leaders and Taliban negotiators meet in Moscow in an attempt to kickstart deadlocked peace talks.
""The Secretary-General has asked Mr Arnault to assist in the achievement of a political solution to the conflict, working closely with the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and regional partners,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement.
Dujarric said earlier on Wednesday that the United Nations was not sending anyone to the talks in Moscow.
U.S. special envoy on Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad has been trying to drum up support for a written proposal that includes an interim government and ceasefire, as U.S. President Joe Biden reviews plans for Afghanistan ahead of a May 1 troop withdrawal deadline agreed with the Taliban by the Trump administration.
The Moscow gathering will be followed by a meeting of regional players in the first week of April in Turkey and a summit that Khalilzad has asked the United Nations to organise, styled on a 2001 conference in the Germany city of Bonn. 
""Our aim is to best support the people in Afghanistan in reaching peace and in ensuring that the gains that have been obtained ... especially on the rights of women, are not lost in any political discussion. But I don't have any firm dates or meetings to announce for you as of yet,"" Dujarric said.

Two people familiar with the State Department document, which was first reported by the United Arab Emirates-based newspaper The National, said it was still in an early “working stage” but could eventually form the basis for rolling back parts of Trump’s approach that Palestinians denounced as heavily biased in favor of Israel.
Since President Joe Biden took office on Jan. 20, his aides have said they intend to repair relations with the Palestinians. The administration has pledged to resume hundreds of millions of dollars in economic and humanitarian assistance and work toward reopening the Palestinians’ diplomatic mission in Washington.
Biden’s aides have also made clear they want to re-establish the goal of a negotiated two-state solution as a priority in U.S. policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But they have moved cautiously with Israel's March 23 elections looming, followed by Palestinian elections scheduled in coming months.
A portion of the draft memo quoted by The National said the U.S. vision is ""to advance freedom, security, and prosperity for both Israelis and Palestinians in the immediate term.""
The document was cited as saying $15 million in COVID-19 pandemic aid to the Palestinians could be announced by the end of March. It is also reported to take a tougher stance on Israeli settlement activities and mentions efforts “to obtain a Palestinian commitment to end payments to individuals imprisoned (by Israel) for acts of terrorism.”
One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the document was a preliminary draft subject to revision and any final version would require inter-agency review.

""We don't have any comments on that specific memo,” U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jalina Porter told reporters at a daily briefing.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has agreed to an Ethiopian request for a joint investigation in the country's northern Tigray region, where Bachelet says possible war crimes may have been committed. 
Fighting between government troops and the region's former ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), has killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes in the mountainous region of about 5 million.
The United Nations has raised concerns about atrocities being committed in Tigray, while U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described acts carried out in the region as ethnic cleansing. Ethiopia has rejected Blinken's allegation.
Bachelet ""responded positively"" to a request from the state-run Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) for joint investigations in Tigray, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights spokesman Jonathan Fowler said on Wednesday.
""The U.N. Human Rights Office and the EHRC are now developing an investigation plan, which includes resources needed and practical modalities, in order to launch the missions as soon as possible,"" Fowler said.
Ethiopia's foreign ministry said on Saturday it was ready to work with international human rights experts to conduct investigations on allegations of abuses.
Amnesty International last month accused Eritrean forces of killing hundreds of civilians over 24 hours in Axum city last year. Eritrea denied that, but the EHRC also described such killings in a rare acknowledgment from the Ethiopian side that Eritrean troops have participated in the conflict.
The United Nations and the United States have demanded that Eritrean troops leave Tigray. 

Both the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments have denied Eritrean troops are in Tigray, despite dozens of eyewitness accounts and admissions that Eritreans are there from Tigray's federally-appointed regional administration.

421,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 06:41PM ET</span>","Bolstered by allies, Biden officials take blunt message to first China talks","By Michael Martina, Yew Lun Tian and Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States will take an uncompromising stance in talks with China on Thursday in Alaska, officials have said, in the first face-to-face meetings between senior officials from the two rivals since U.S. President Joe Biden took office.
Beijing has called for a reset to ties, now at their lowest in decades, but Washington has said the Alaska talks will be a one-off, and any future engagement depends on China improving its behavior.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan will meet China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and State Councilor Wang Yi in Anchorage, fresh off of visits to allies Japan and South Korea aimed at emphasizing the U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific in the face of Beijing's rise. 
Blinken blasted China on Wednesday for its aggression while in Japan, and urged South Korea to work with the United States to prevent a ""dangerous erosion of democracy"" in the region.
""China is using coercion and aggression to systematically erode autonomy in Hong Kong, undercut democracy in Taiwan, abuse human rights in Xinjiang and Tibet, and assert maritime claims in the South China Sea that violate international law,"" Blinken said at the start of a meeting with South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong. 
It was a measure of the bluntness that has come to mark the U.S. posture toward Beijing under Biden, as the world's two largest economies search for a semblance of stable ground on which to base ties, after they sank under former President Donald Trump. 
The Anchorage meeting – the first high-level face-to-face exchange since June when Blinken's predecessor, Mike Pompeo, held a frosty meeting with Yang in Hawaii – is likely to be short on diplomatic niceties, and outcomes.
Due to COVID restrictions, there are no plans for a shared meal, which had been a feature of recent exchanges. And the two sides clearly have divergent expectations.
On Wednesday, the United States issued a flurry of actions directed at China, including a move to begin revoking Chinese telecoms licenses, subpoenas to multiple Chinese information technology companies over national security concerns, and updated sanctions on China over a rollback of democracy in Hong Kong.
On Twitter, China's ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai, urged that the Alaska meeting be the start of constructive bilateral communication, while adding: ""Unilateral pressure and sanctions only lead to a dead end.""
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has referred to the talks as a ""high-level strategic dialogue"" and a person in Beijing familiar with planning for the talks told Reuters China hopes they will help set a broad framework for resuming engagement, rather than resolve specific issues.
But Biden officials have been explicit that Alaska is not a return to regular dialogue, which under previous administrations did little to resolve Washington's concerns with Beijing. 
""We expect that there are parts of the conversation that could be difficult,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.
A senior U.S. administration official said Washington would be looking at ""deeds, not words"" if Beijing wanted to change the tone of the relationship.
'FIRST ROUND OF A BOXING MATCH'
On paper, at least, the context for bilateral relations has changed for Beijing since Trump, with his go-it-alone ""America First"" foreign policy. Biden has pledged to restore American alliances, and its partners appear ready to oblige.
Last week Biden and the leaders of Japan, India and Australia pledged at a summit to cooperate on maritime, cyber, and economic security, issues vital to their four democracies in the face of challenges from China. 
And the Biden administration has embarked on a ""Europe roadshow"", what U.S. officials have been calling daily engagement with Europe on issues including China's rise. 
Evan Medeiros, an Asia specialist in the Obama administration who now teaches at Georgetown University, called the Alaska talks ""the first round of a boxing match"" that was unlikely to resolve any major issues, but could lower the chance of future miscalculations between the rivals.
""I think it's largely going to be an airing of grievances on both sides,"" Medeiros said.
ON U.S. SOIL
Sullivan told reporters last week he did not expect Trump's Phase 1 trade deal, or details on tariffs or export controls, to be a major topic in Alaska, and noted many of the economic specialists needed to reach detailed agreements would be absent.
He said the United States would convey to China its strategic intention and concerns with China's actions, including the rollback of democracy in Hong Kong, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, strains across the Taiwan Strait, economic coercion of Australia, and harassment in waters disputed with Japan.
Those are all areas where Beijing says Washington should not meddle.
Biden officials have said it was important that their first high-level contact with China happen in the United States, with Alaska a symbolic reference to enduring U.S. Pacific power. 
It will be the second consecutive time in less than a year that Yang has flown to U.S. soil. Despite this gesture, seen by Chinese observers as a sign of Beijing's goodwill, there appears little hope, on either side, for breakthroughs. 

""Even if there is some initial cooperation on concrete matters like climate change, the positive effect of that is insignificant in the face of relations marked by competition and confrontation on all fronts,"" Shi Yinhong, a professor at Beijing's Renmin University, told Reuters.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 06:31PM ET</span>",Tanzania's President John Magufuli dead at 61,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Tanzania's President John Magufuli, one of Africa's most prominent coronavirus sceptics, has died aged 61, Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan said on Wednesday after a more than two-week absence from public life that led to speculation about his health. 
She said he died from the heart disease that had plagued him for a decade. She said burial arrangements were under way and announced 14 days of mourning and the flying of flags at half staff. State television broadcast mournful and religious songs.
Magufuli, had not been seen in public since Feb. 27, sparking rumours that he had contracted COVID-19. Officials denied on March 12 that he had fallen ill and on Monday the vice president urged Tanzanians not to listen to rumours from outside the country and said it was normal for a human being to be checked for the flu or fever..
“Dear Tanzanians, it is sad to announce that today 17 March 2021 around 6 p.m. we lost our brave leader, President John Magufuli who died from heart disease at Mzena hospital in Dar es Salaam where he was getting treatment,"" the vice president said on state broadcaster TBC. 
He was Tanzania's first president to die while in office.
Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said on Friday that he had spoken to Magufuli, and blamed the narrative of the president's ailment on some ""hateful"" Tanzanians living abroad.
Tundu Lissu, Magufuli's main rival in the October election when the president won a second five-year term, had suggested Tanzania's leader had been flown to Kenya for treatment for COVID-19 and then moved to India in a coma.
After the death was announced, opposition leader Zitto Kabwe said he had spoken to Vice President Hassan to offer condolences for Magufuli's death. ""The nation will remember him for his contribution to the development of our country,"" Kabwe said in a statement published on Twitter.
HASSAN WOULD BE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENTAccording to Tanzania's Constitution, Vice President Hassan, 61, should assume the presidency for the remainder of the five-year term that Magufuli began serving last year after winning a second term. She would be the East African nation's first female president. 
Born in the semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar, Hassan studied economics in Britain, worked for the U.N.'s World Food Programme and then held various government posts prior to becoming Tanzania's first female vice president in 2015.
Hassan said Magufuli was admitted on March 6 to Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute for heart problems and discharged the next day. A week later he felt bad and was rushed to Mzena hospital where he was getting treatment under supervision of doctors from the cardiac institute, she said.
In Dar es Salaam, the country's commercial capital with more than two million residents, the streets were empty when news of Magufuli's death was announced just before midnight.
""I remember him since his days when he was minister of works and then he became president, a president who worked hard that even if you didn't agree with him it got to a point that you agreed with him. I appreciated him, he did a really good job,"" one man, Patrice Tarimo, said in Dar es Salaam after hearing the news. 
'THE BULLDOZER'
Nicknamed ""The Bulldozer"" because of his reputation for pushing through policies despite opposition, Magufuli frustrated the World Health Organization (WHO) during the pandemic by playing down the threat from COVID-19, saying god and remedies such as steam inhalation would protect Tanzanians.
The former chemistry teacher had mocked coronavirus tests, denounced vaccines as part of a Western conspiracy to take Africa's wealth, and opposed mask-wearing and social distancing.
Tanzania stopped reporting coronavirus data in May last year when it had reported 509 cases and 21 deaths, according to the WHO, which has urged the government to be more transparent.

He was re-elected for a second term in 2020, winning 84% of the vote in an election the opposition said was marred by irregularities and whose results it rejected.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A San Antonio man was arrested near the official residence of Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington on Wednesday and was charged with weapons-related offenses, the U.S. Secret Service said. 
The Secret Service, responsible for the security of the president and vice president, said the suspect, Paul Murray, 31, was detained by its uniformed officers on the street near a government complex that houses the vice president's residence and the U.S. Naval Observatory.
Washington's Metropolitan Police Department said its officers then arrested and charged Murray. 
The department said the arrest was sparked by an ""intelligence bulletin that originated from Texas."" The department did not elaborate on the bulletin's contents.
A reporter at Fox News' Washington affiliate tweeted a Texas law enforcement bulletin that said Murray had been experiencing ""paranoid delusions"" that the military or government wanted to kill him, and that he sent his mother a text message saying he was in Washington and was going to ""take care of his problem.""
D.C. police said Murray was charged with carrying a dangerous weapon, carrying a rifle or shotgun outside of a business, possession of unregistered ammunition and possession of a large-capacity ammunition-feeding device.
Police said a rifle and ammunition were recovered from Murray's vehicle.

424,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 06:21PM ET</span>","Polls show Brazil's Bolsonaro faces record disapproval, pressure from Lula","SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilians' disapproval of President Jair Bolsonaro's handling of the COVID-19 crisis is at a record high and he may face a tough campaign for re-election next year, according to new polls, as Brazil struggles with its worst pandemic surge yet. 
A Datafolha survey, released late on Tuesday, showed 54% of Brazilians regard Bolsonaro's handling of the crisis as bad or awful. A separate poll by PoderData showed two leftist rivals could beat Bolsonaro in a potential runoff vote in October 2022. 
Support for Bolsonaro has eroded as Brazil faces a brutal second wave of coronavirus cases, with a record 2,841 deaths in 24 hours reported on Tuesday and a record 90,303 new confirmed infections reported on Wednesday.
The president's prospects have also dimmed since his political nemesis, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, had his corruption convictions overturned this month by the Supreme Court, allowing him to run in the 2022 election.
Lula and leftist former lawmaker Ciro Gomes would have more support than Bolsonaro in a hypothetical runoff vote, according to the PoderData survey, which showed both of them 5 percentage points ahead of Bolsonaro in simulated match-ups.
In 2018, Bolsonaro beat Fernando Haddad, the Workers Party candidate handpicked by Lula, by 55% to 45% in the runoff vote.
The Datafolha poll of 2,023 people, carried out this week, showed a further decline in confidence in Bolsonaro over the pandemic since the previous poll on Jan. 20-21, when 48% respondents expressed disapproval. 
It also showed that 50% of Brazilians reject a potential impeachment of Bolsonaro, while 46% are in favor. In the Jan. Poll, 53% were against impeachment while 42% supported it. 

The PoderData poll was carried out between March 15 and 17 and 3,500 people were polled via telephone.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's Senate on Wednesday passed a bill expanding the scope of medically assisted death, which would make the option accessible to people with a serious medical condition but whose death is not considered imminent.
Assisted death has been legal in Canada since 2016 but a Quebec court in 2019 ruled the law's requirement that the person's natural death be ""reasonably foreseeable"" to be unconstitutional.
The new law will remove that requirement, and opens the door to allowing assisted death for people whose sole underlying condition is mental illness. It prohibits for two years assisted death for people whose only underlying condition is mental illness, after which the government is expected to bring forward a framework allowing people with mental illness to access assisted death.
Almost 14,000 people accessed medically assisted death in Canada between 2016 and 2019, according to government data.
Assisted death is legal in some form in Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Switzerland and several U.S. states.
The new law would make it easier to access assisted death in Canada than in some other countries, said Jocelyn Downie, a law and health policy professor at Dalhousie University - a framework closer to Belgium and the Netherlands than the United States and Australia.
The bill's fundamental element is choice, Downie said, adding that better supports for people with disabilities or mental illness are still needed.
The bill drew vehement opposition from groups who say it devalues the lives of people with disabilities and people with mental illness.
""[The government's] actions set us back decades and will further entrench disability-based discrimination in this country,"" Krista Carr of advocacy group Inclusion Canada said in a statement last week.
Before it becomes law, the acting head of state will have to sign the bill, but it is a formality.

426,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 05:50PM ET</span>",Tanzania's 'Bulldozer' president and COVID-19 sceptic dies,"Tanzania's President John Magufuli, admired by followers for his hostility to corruption and waste but regarded by foes as an irascible authoritarian intolerant of dissent and sceptical about COVID-19, has died aged 61.
He was nicknamed ""The Bulldozer"" for his fondness for massive public works and a reputation for pushing through policies despite opposition - a hard-charging leadership style that won support from many Tanzanians.
But he also attracted criticism at home and abroad for what opponents saw as his eccentric handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan said on Wednesday he had died of heart illness, days after officials denied he had fallen ill amid rumours that he had contracted COVID-19.
Mangufuli decried lockdowns, was sceptical of COVID-19 drugs and suggested vaccines may be part of a foreign plot to steal Africa's wealth. 
""Vaccines are not good. If they were, then the white man would have brought vaccines for HIV/AIDS,"" he said. ""Tanzanians should be careful with these imported things. You should not think that they love you a lot. This nation is rich, Africa is rich, everyone wants some of it.""
The government stopped reporting statistics for new cases and deaths in May last year when it had registered 509 cases and 21 deaths. Magufuli had questioned coronavirus testing kits - which he said had returned positive results on a goat and pawpaw fruit. He declared the pandemic over and reopened the economy.
But the death in February of a senior politician from the semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar raised concerns about a hidden pandemic running amok in the East African nation.
Magufuli's approach caused alarm at the World Health Organization, prompting its head to implore Tanzania to improve public health measures, prepare to distribute vaccines and start reporting coronavirus cases and sharing data.
QUICK RISE TO INFLUENCE
Born in the village of Chato in the Geita region of northwestern Tanzania, Magufuli was first elected to parliament in 1995 from his home constituency. 
A former chemistry teacher, he quickly climbed the political ladder and served in various cabinet roles, including as minister of works, before he won the presidency in 2015. 
During his first presidential campaign he captured headlines by doing push-ups at a rally to demonstrate his physical fitness for office. His cost-cutting including cancelling independence day festivities and restricting foreign travel by officials. 
He was re-elected for a second term in 2020, winning 84% of the vote in a ballot the opposition said was marred by irregularities and whose results it rejected.
Upon re-election, he promised to build on his agenda of fighting corruption and reducing wasteful public spending, moves which won him praise in his first term. 
Magufuli, in no-nonsense style, would make unannounced inspection visits to government departments, and once sacked senior managers at Tanzania's main public hospital, saying they were not delivering. He also purged thousands of ""ghost workers"" from the government, and reduced his own salary as part of spending cuts. https://reut.rs/2NHdzmc
He was tough on businesses when he thought they were under-paying taxes. In 2017, his government accused gold producer Acacia Mining of evading taxes and under-declaring exports, hitting it with a $190 billion tax bill. https://www.reuters.com/article/acacia-mining-tanzania-idUSL5N1KF5CE
Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) Corp, which owned the majority of Acacia and eventually bought it out, agreed to pay Tanzania $300 million to settle tax and other disputes.
Critics said Magufuli had presided over a deterioration of the political scene, after his administration arrested opposition leaders, suspended some newspapers and restricted political rallies. The government denies suppressing dissent.
Among those critics is opposition leader Tundu Lissu, shot 16 times by unknown gunmen in the administrative capital Dodoma in September 2017.
He accused the state of trying to kill him, which the government denied. Magufuli condemned the shooting and ordered security forces to investigate, but no one has been arrested. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tanzania-politics-idUSKCN24S15Z
On the economic front, he embarked on ambitious infrastructure projects in the hope of supercharging East Africa's third largest economy. 

These included a railway, a hydropower project and the revival of state carrier Air Tanzania, spending billions of dollars in the process.

""He will pay a price,"" Biden told ABC News in an interview broadcast on Wednesday. Asked what the consequences would be, he said, ""You'll see shortly.""
A U.S. intelligence report on Tuesday bolstered longstanding allegations that Putin was behind Moscow's election interference, an accusation Russia called baseless.
At the same time, Biden noted that ""there's places where it's in our mutual interest to work together"" such as renewing the START nuclear agreement, adding that the two leaders have a known history.
""I know him relatively well,"" Biden said, adding that ""the most important thing dealing with foreign leaders in my experience ... is just know the other guy.""
Of Putin, Biden said he does not think the Russian leader has a soul. Asked if he thought Putin was a killer, he told ABC: ""I do.""
Biden defeated Trump in the election and took office two months ago.

430,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 05:00PM ET</span>",Pro-Europe Dutch politician Kaag books gains in election,"By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Former diplomat Sigrid Kaag, who heads the largest left-leaning party in the Netherlands, booked major gains at a national election after campaigning on a cosmopolitan pro-Europe platform that stands in contrast with Prime Minister Mark Rutte's euroscepticism.
Though Rutte's conservative VVD Party attracted the most votes according to the first exit poll, Kaag's D-66 party finished second and gained eight seats in the 150 member parliament, more than any other party, helped by her strong performance in debates.
The result sets D-66 up to become the VVD's main partner in a new coalition, from the third place it holds currently, and will make Kaag the most influential woman in Dutch politics to date.
At the final election debate on Tuesday night, she defended the European Union and euro currency as crucial to Dutch interests, a contrast with Rutte's ambivalent approach that made him reluctant to contribute to the EU's coronavirus crisis fund.
As a small country ""we can have more sway by being a leader, making choices within the economy, with international trade agreements, and at the geo-political level, if we do it with others,"" Kaag said.
An Arabic-speaking former diplomat, she is the rare example of a Dutch politician known better abroad than at home.
She served as United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon in 2015-2017, and before that headed a U.N. team overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons. She entered politics in 2017 in her current job as the Netherlands' Foreign Trade Minister.
When she was proposed as a member of Rutte's Cabinet, the Likud party of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly opposed her nomination, arguing that she favoured Palestinian causes. She is married to a Palestinian.
Now 59, she was viewed in opinion polls as the second-most credible prime minister candidate among current party leaders after Rutte.

Kaag's party favours more taxation and spending, with education and renewable energy among top priorities. Her influence will depend on coalition talks that will commence within days of the March 15-17 elections, which were spread out over three days due to the coronavirus pandemic.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's blazing fast vaccination program has reached the icy shores of Antarctica, officials and researchers told Reuters on Wednesday, bringing a sense of relief to one of the most isolated and vulnerable outposts on Earth. 
The pandemic hit Antarctica in December, making it the last of the world's continents to report an outbreak of COVID-19. Chilean health and army officials scrambled to clear out staff from a remote region with limited medical facilities.
Marcela Andrade, an official with the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH), told Reuters by phone that air force personnel, followed by staff at the Profesor Julio Escudero research base, were inoculated on Sunday with vaccine from China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd.
She said the outbreak scare several months ago was well-managed, but a reminder of the importance of speedy vaccination in such a remote and unforgiving location.
""It's a relief,"" said Andrade, who said workers in the isolated region were at special risk. ""We don't have flights or ships departing every day here. It's complicated to transport people that (are ill) or a risk to others.""
The base is located on remote King George Island, the largest of the Shetland Islands off the coast of Antarctica. Researchers count as their nearest neighbors several species of seals, penguins and fish-eating sea birds.
Chile has vaulted ahead of much of Latin America, and the world, in its vaccination program, and has inoculated most of its frontline health workers, military and elderly. But a spike in contagions country-wide has brought hospitals to near collapse and forced new restrictions on movement. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi)
Andrade said Chile's decision to vaccinate workers in Antarctica was much appreciated, and timely. She said a shift of workers was scheduled to leave for the mainland in mid-April, and would breathe easier with the vaccine in place.

""Looking at the situation in the country, and the world, it's a total relief to get back to the mainland with a bit of protection,"" she said.

433,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 04:30PM ET</span>","Georgia shooting suspect attended church, was from Atlanta area","By Nathan Layne and Rich McKay
(Reuters) - The Georgia man arrested in connection with shootings at Atlanta-area day spas that left eight people dead graduated from a high school north of Georgia's capital in 2017 and attended a Baptist church in the area.
Robert Aaron Long, 21, of Woodstock, Georgia was arrested on Tuesday night and was being held in a Cherokee County detention center. His mug shot released by authorities showed him with a chin beard, short hair on the sides of his head, and longer hair on the top, some reaching his eyes.
Long graduated from Sequoyah High School in Canton, Georgia in 2017, a Cherokee County School District spokeswoman said.
The Daily Beast reported that an Instagram account appearing to belong to Long, but which was no longer active, contained a tagline that read: ""Pizza, guns, drums, music, family, and God. This pretty much sums up my life. It's a pretty good life.""
Authorities said they did not have any initial indication that Tuesday's shootings were racially motivated. Six of the eight victims were women of Asian descent. A white woman and white man were also among those killed. Long is white. 
Officials said Long indicated he may have frequented the spas where Tuesday's violence occurred, although authorities could not immediately confirm he had visited any of them in the past. Officials said Long may have been struggling with a sexual addiction that he presented as his motive for violence that primarily targeted minority women.
Elders at the Crabapple First Baptist Church, which Long attended in nearby Milton, Georgia, issued a statement expressing grief over the shootings.
""We are heartbroken for all involved. We grieve for the victims and their families, and we continue to pray for them,"" the statement said. ""Moreover, we are distraught for the Long family and continue to pray for them as well.""
The church appeared to have disabled its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, which had contained a 2018 video clip in which Long talked about his baptism and youth group in the seventh grade when a speaker discussed the biblical parable of the prodigal son, according to the Daily Beast.
""The son goes off and squanders all that he has and lives completely for himself and then, when he finds he's wanting to eat pig food, he realized there's something wrong and he goes back to his father and his father runs back to him and embraces him,"" Long said in the clip. ""And by the grace of God I was able to draw the connection there and realize this is a story between what happened with me and God.""
Long's family did not respond to a request for comment. The family facilitated the arrest, according to the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department.
Reuters visited the address listed in public records for the suspect and two other people with his surname. It was a modest, well-kept house in an upper middle-class neighborhood in Woodstock, a predominantly white Cherokee County community of about 33,000 people. Wednesday, the shades were drawn and an American flag hung from an awning at the front of the ranch-style home.
Summer Barber, a 21-year-old dog groomer who lives up the road, said she had seen some of the residents ride four-wheelers on the weekends and had a few casual conversations with them, including to offer to groom their golden doodle.
Barber said she believed she had spoken with the suspect and a woman who might be his mother.

""They seem real nice, normal,"" Barber said, adding that the area, which is not far from horse pastures, was a nice place to live. ""Nothing ever really happens here, people work, raise families.""

(Reuters) - Russia hosts a key summit on Thursday to revive the Afghan peace process, the first in a series of meetings that make unlikely allies of Washington and Moscow as they try to pave the way for an interim government in Kabul and end the bloodshed.
The United States is shifting focus from largely stalled negotiations in Qatar's capital to meetings among key regional countries aimed at pushing Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, Taliban insurgents and other Afghan political leaders to form a transitory government as soon as possible.
The Moscow meeting will include U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and representatives from Pakistan and China, according to officials. A team of Afghan political leaders and government representatives and a Taliban delegation will also attend.
Khalilzad has been trying to drum up support for a written proposal that includes an interim government and ceasefire, as U.S. President Joe Biden reviews plans for Afghanistan ahead of a May 1 troop withdrawal deadline agreed with the Taliban by the Trump administration.
The Moscow gathering will be followed by a meeting of regional players in the first week of April in Turkey and a summit that Khalilzad has asked the United Nations to organise, styled on a 2001 conference in the Germany city of Bonn.
It was there that Afghan leaders met to set up a provisional administration after the Taliban was ousted by local forces backed by the U.S. military.
Some diplomats and experts said that for the renewed peace push to succeed, Washington must align itself with countries including Russia, China and Iran, with which it has strained relations.
Both Russia and the United States support the idea of an interim government, said a diplomatic source whose country will be present in Moscow, which could pressure Afghan leaders to give ground while Pakistan leans on the Taliban to do the same.
""If they are working together it is very possible to bring this war to an end,"" the source said, adding the main hurdle was any lingering mistrust between Moscow and Washington.
The warring Afghan sides have yet to reach a peace deal amid mutual suspicion and ongoing violence in Afghanistan which the government largely blames on the Taliban.
The Islamist militant movement sees Ghani as a lackey to the West and insists remaining foreign troops leave the country.
Iran, which borders Afghanistan, is not attending the Moscow meeting. The source said Tehran had communicated it would accept an interim government so long as it had representation from minority ethnic groups that have historic ties with Iran.
Iranian officials and Russia's foreign ministry could not be immediately reached for comment.
CHALLENGES AHEAD
Three diplomatic sources and one international official said that traditional U.S. partners including European and NATO nations felt sidelined by Washington's regional push.
Some experts said that, although talks in Doha had struggled to make progress since starting in September, peace negotiations tended to take time.
""They're scrambling as if they need to fix a broken process, but it's barely even started,"" said Andrew Watkins, senior Afghanistan analyst at International Crisis Group.
There are also concerns among some officials over whether an interim government – which Ghani has vehemently opposed and the Taliban have said they would not join – was feasible.
A Taliban leader said they would avoid joining an interim government, although they would support replacing Ghani's administration. He added that they had refused a request to allow U.S. forces to stay in Afghanistan after April.
A Taliban spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Three more diplomatic sources familiar with the discussions said Ghani was under intense pressure from the United States to accept an interim government.
The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Key to the Taliban, a separate source familiar with negotiations said, was an Islamic jurisprudence council that would oversee the president. They also wanted half of government positions and the chance to nominate a president.

A spokesman for Ghani's office denied any pressure, saying the leader had a respectful working relationship with the United States and that no amount of pressure would lead them to accept an unelected interim government.

The ruling defies an order this week from a regional West African court for Saab's release. The Colombian businessman, who was detained in Cape Verde last June, is wanted by U.S. authorities on charges of laundering money on behalf of Venezuela's government.
Responding to the Supreme Court's decision in a statement, his defence team said: ""We will appeal to the Constitutional Court and reaffirm our confidence in the release of Ambassador Saab."" 
Saab has been repeatedly named by the U.S. State Department as an operator who helps Maduro arrange trade deals that Washington is seeking to block through sanctions. His lawyers have called the U.S. charges ""politically motivated.""

The alleged victim, who is now 28 and identified only as L.G., testified in the latest hearing of the trial of two priests, one charged with abuse and the other with covering up the attacks.
L.G. has alleged that Gabriele Martinelli, now 28 and now a priest, repeatedly forced him to have sex, mostly while they were both minors in the Pius X Pre-Seminary.
The seminary houses altar boys who serve Mass in St. Peter's Basilica - the domed papal church at the heart of the Vatican - and are thinking of becoming priests. 
The events are alleged to have taken place between 2007 and 2012 and Martinelli later went on to become a priest in northern Italy. 
L.G. said that Martinelli would slip into his bed at night and force him to touch him and also to have sex in another room. Martinelli, who testified last month, has denied the allegations.
During a three-hour hearing on Wednesday L.G. said Martinelli had tried to convince him to have sex in a bathroom behind one of the altars in St. Peter's Basilica while both were due to serve Mass. 
""I was shocked,"" L.G. said, adding that he refused to follow Martinelli, who was naked under his cassock, into the bathroom.
The other defendant is Father Enrico Radice, 72, who was rector at the time and who is charged with covering up the alleged abuse.
The prosecution says Radice did not block Martinelli from becoming a priest after he left the pre-seminary even though he knew about the abuse.

Radice, who had given Martinelli supervisory responsibilities over the other altar boys, denies this.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday underscored his strong commitment to the landmark 1998 Good Friday peace agreement and the need to maintain the political and economic stability of Northern Ireland.
""We strongly support that, and think it's critically important to be maintained,"" Biden said at the start of a virtual meeting with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin on St. Patrick's Day. ""The political and economic stability of Northern Ireland is very much in the interest of all our people.""
Biden and Martin pledged to expand ties between the two close allies, including on issues such as climate change, combating the coronavirus pandemic, and cancer research.
Martin said he looked forward to visiting Washington and hoped Biden would be able to visit Ireland once it was safe.
The Irish leader thanked Biden for his ""unwavering support"" of the Good Friday Agreement, adding, ""It has meant a lot. And it has mattered.""
""With a new trading relationship now in place between the European Union and the United Kingdom, and a protocol that protects peace and avoids a hard border on this island, I want to move forward with a positive relationship with the United Kingdom,"" Martin said. ""That means standing by what has been agreed and working together to make a success of it.""
A senior U.S. official told reporters before the meeting that the Biden administration viewed a British-EU rift over the movement of goods to Northern Ireland as a trade issue, and would not take sides on the matter.
Martin also met virtually with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, who underscored what she called America's ""steadfast and strong"" commitment to Ireland.
""In the midst of global freedoms being in decline, our nations remain close because we are committed to democracy,"" Harris said in her ceremonial office, which was adorned with a large shamrock-type plant in honor of St. Patrick's Day.
Biden, an Irish-American, said the White House would be illuminated in green later Wednesday to ""celebrate the deep, deep affection"" Americans had for Ireland. Fountains at the White House also ran green, continuing a tradition that dates back to the administration of former President Barack Obama.
""The key objective is of course to deepen our relationship,"" Martin told MSNBC earlier. ""In President Biden, we have the most Irish-American president since John F. Kennedy, and his election was greeted with great affection and warmth in Ireland.""
The meeting came amid simmering disputes related to the implementation of agreements put into place as the UK exited the EU, including the Northern Ireland protocol, which governs the movement of goods into the British-ruled province.
The dispute has raised tensions in the region, more than two decades after the 1998 accord that largely ended three decades of violence between mostly Protestant unionists, who want Northern Ireland to stay in the UK, and mostly Roman Catholic nationalists seeking to unite the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.
Biden has long expressed firm support for the Good Friday Agreement.
The senior U.S. official said Washington welcomed provisions in both the EU-UK Trade and cooperation agreements, as well as the Northern Ireland protocol, which it believed would protect the gains of the peace agreement.
The United States would not ""take sides"" in the dispute over implementation of the protocol, the official said. ""We view that as a trade issue to be resolved between the UK and the EU, and hope that both sides are able to return to the table and discuss the implementation of the agreement.""
Martin has said Ireland, an EU member, is counting on U.S. support to help maintain the political stability of Northern Ireland.
Earlier this month, Northern Irish loyalist paramilitary groups said they were temporarily withdrawing support for the 1998 peace agreement due to concerns over the Brexit deal.
The groups expressed concern about a disruption to trade between Britain and Northern Ireland and said they believed that Britain, Ireland and the EU had breached their commitments to the peace deal.
No decision has been made on the U.S. appointment of a special envoy to deal with Northern Ireland, the U.S. official said. 
The virtual meeting with Martin is the first bilateral event with Ireland hosted by Biden, who attended a St. Patrick's Day Mass at his church in Delaware before returning to Washington. Biden is expected to make a trip to Ireland as soon as this summer.

Martin also participated virtually in the annual U.S. congressional luncheon marking Ireland's national day and the close ties between the two countries.

The U.S. Commerce Department, in a statement, said the move would tighten sanctions originally put in place in response to the March 2018 poisoning of former Russian military officer intelligence Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England, with a military-grade nerve agent. Moscow has denied any role in either case.
The department ""is committed to preventing Russia from accessing sensitive U.S. technologies that might be diverted to its malign chemical weapons activities,"" it said.

443,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 02:50PM ET</span>","France, others set to increase pressure on Lebanon's politicians, diplomat says","PARIS (Reuters) - France and its international partners will seek to increase pressure on Lebanon's politicians in the coming months, a French diplomat said on Wednesday, although he did not envisage sanctions against individuals in the immediate term.
Paris has spearheaded international efforts to rescue the former French protectorate from its deepest crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war, but has failed so far to persuade squabbling politicians to adopt a reform roadmap and form a new government to unlock international aid.
Protests have grown since the Lebanese currency hit new lows, deepening popular anger over Lebanon's financial collapse.
""On a political level, what's called for is a very strong increase in pressure on the Lebanese actors,"" the diplomat, who asked not to be identified, told reporters.
""We will act with our European partners and Americans to identify all the pressure levers that we can put in place so that those who believe they have a greater advantage in blocking the system and forming a government reconsider their calculations."" 
When asked whether that meant possible sanctions on Lebanese officials, the diplomat said the short-term objective was to raise ""political pressure"".
""It wasn't a priority in August/September, but after six or seven months the question is legitimate,"" he said, adding nothing concrete was being discussed for now. 
Coordination with the United States on the issue was more fluid, he said, because the new administration could see the merits of French efforts while the Trump administration had seen Lebanon through the prism of its maximum pressure campaign targeting Iran.
""What we can see after seven months is that there is an extraordinary resistance, (acceptance of the) status quo and sharing the cake of the Lebanese system, but there isn't much left of the cake to share,"" the diplomat said.
""Our role is to try and put them (Lebanese politicians) under sufficient pressure so they understand they need to move.""

Another Western diplomat said Paris believed sanctions should be a last resort and it was not yet time for that.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's health ministry was a ""smoking ruin"" last year that failed to secure adequate protective equipment and other supplies early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's former top aide said on Wednesday.
Dominic Cummings, Johnson's senior adviser until November, said Britain's more recent success in rolling out a rapid inoculation programme was the result of a decision to shift vaccine procurement from the ministry to the prime minister.
His comments to a parliamentary committee were among his first public remarks on the coronavirus response he helped lead, and could cause political headaches for Johnson.
The health ministry was ""just a smoking ruin in terms of procurement and PPE and all of that"", Cummings told lawmakers.
""It's not coincidental that the vaccine programme worked the way it did, it's not coincidental that to do that we had to take it out of the Department of Health,"" he said.
""We had to have it authorised very directly by the prime minister and say, strip away all the normal nonsense that we can see is holding back funding ... in the sense that Number 10 took it out of the Department of Health.""
Health minister Matt Hancock glossed over questions about Cummings' comments at a later news conference, saying the roll out of vaccines had been ""a huge team effort"". Johnson's spokesman said he disagreed with Cummings' description.
But Jonathan Ashworth, opposition Labour's health policy spokesman, said his description was ""a clear admission of fundamental mistakes that have contributed to us tragically experiencing one of the highest death rates in the world"".
Cummings, a divisive figure who was the architect of the Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum, was appointed senior adviser in 2019 after Johnson turned to him for help to deliver his promise to ""get Brexit done"".
He told lawmakers on Wednesday he had taken the job to help ""sort out the huge Brexit nightmare"" in return for Johnson agreeing to increased science funding, the creation of a scientific research agency and civil service reform - causes the government is pressing on with despite Cummings' departure. 
Cummings said his exit had been planned, though British media reported at the time it was a result of clashes with others in Johnson's 10 Downing Street office.

Britain has suffered one of the highest per capita death tolls in the world from the pandemic, but in recent months it has rolled out the fastest vaccine programme of any large country. The government says it is on track to have given a first COVID-19 shot to half of all adults in the next few days.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court on Wednesday ruled to release two Istanbul university students while they stand trial on charges of inciting hatred for displaying an image that combined Islamic imagery with LGBT flags, a lawyer said.
A total of seven students are charged in relation to the image, which was displayed at an exhibition during protests against President Tayyip Erdogan's appointment of a rector at Istanbul's prestigious Bogazici University.
The court also released another student from house arrest.
The protests at Bogazici began in January and briefly spread in Istanbul and other cities in February, leading to the detention of 600 people and some clashes with police.
""Because police intervened with tear gas during protests, we held an exhibition as a more peaceful method,"" Dogu Demirtas, one of the two students who had been detained for a month and a half, told the court. 
Demirtas said that they did not know who created the image, that combined a picture of the Kaaba, Islam's holiest site, with LGBT flags, and that they had not put it up themselves. 
He said that he saw a security guard put it up during the exhibition and that it disappeared the following day.
The judge, who asked Demirtas whether he was LGBT, later pulled out the image and displayed it briefly in court.
Lawyer Levent Piskin told the court the incitement charge was not valid because the events did not cause a public reaction and the students' actions were protected by the freedom of expression.
When the image circulated on social media authorities responded with what the United States and the United Nations both described as homophobic rhetoric.
Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu repeatedly labelled the students ""LGBT deviants"" and Erdogan praised his AK Party's youth wing for not being the ""LGBT youth"".
Protests have continued on campus, with students and academics gathering daily to protest what they say was the undemocratic appointment of Melih Bulu, an academic and former political candidate, as rector.
Before the hearing around 200 people, mostly students, gathered some distance from Istanbul's main courthouse, where the main square was closed off by police. They chanted slogans, while more than 50 riot police waited around the group.

France, along with Britain, Germany and the European Union, are striving to bring the United States and Iran to the table for informal talks as a first step toward reviving Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal, which lifted international sanctions on the Islamic Republic in exchange for curbs to its nuclear programme.
""There is a tactical problem and also an internal (issue) in Iran, which is in a particular situation because we are quite close to (its) presidential election in June,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a French Senate hearing on Tuesday.
Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, hit back on Twitter: ""Nothing will happen unless the #UnitedStates takes effective actions to lift the oppressive #sanctions."" 
""The current stalemate is not tactical and domestic, but related to the West's deceptive strategy,"" Shamkhani said, without mentioning Le Drian.
Le Drian did not say what the tactical problem was, but added that while there was a stated will to return to talks, tensions prevailed and it was urgent to calm the situation and move forward.
Iran began breaching the deal's limits on uranium enrichment activity in 2019 in response to a U.S. withdrawal from the deal and reimposition of U.S. economic sanctions ordered by then-U.S. President Donald Trump, who opposed the agreement - reached before he took office - and sought to wreck it.
Iran has recently accelerated its breaches in an apparent bid to pressure U.S. President Joe Biden with both sides in a standoff over who should move first to save the deal.
Both sides so far appear unwilling to compromise. The Iranian New Year this week and the campaign ahead of presidential elections in June in Iran are also likely to complicate matters.
Tehran has ruled out broadening nuclear talks to other subjects such as its ballistic missile programme, as called for by Washington.

China's ambassador in February sent a letter to Alain Richard, the head of the Senate's Taiwan Friendship Group, expressing his concern about the visit this summer. He urged that no meetings take place that could harm Franco-Chinese ties. 
China says Taiwan is part of ""one China"", and that this principle must be accepted by any country with which it has diplomatic relations. 
The letter was leaked to French media with various accounts describing how Richard - a former defence minister under President Jacques Chirac - was outraged after receiving the correspondence. Richard has previously travelled to Taiwan in his existing role. 
That prompted the Chinese embassy to publish the letter on its website and formally warn the senators about the trip that it said would violate the one-China principle and send the wrong signal to Taiwan's pro-independence forces.
""French senators, as members of a French state institution, should of course observe this principle and refrain from any form of official contact with the Taiwanese authorities,"" it said in a post on March 16.
When asked to respond on Wednesday, France's foreign ministry spokeswoman pointed to the separation of powers in the country.
""French parliamentarians freely decide their travel and their contacts,"" she said. 
It is not the first time China's ambassador Lu Shaye in Paris has angered Paris. He was summoned by the foreign ministry last April over posts and tweets by the embassy defending Beijing's response to the pandemic and criticising the West's handling of the outbreak.

Seif was detained in June 2019 outside the public prosecutor's office as she tried to file a complaint about the detention conditions of her brother Alaa Abdel Fattah, one of Egypt's best-known activists, their family says.
She was also among the activists who had campaigned on social media for the release of some prisoners amid fears that coronavirus would spread in prisons.
Three other members of her family were briefly detained in March 2020 for protesting over the same issue.
A Cairo criminal court convicted Seif for spreading and broadcasting false news that would cause panic, the false allegation of the spread of the coronavirus in prisons and misusing social media sites, judicial sources said.
Seif has the right to appeal the ruling within 60 days, they said.
Her brother Alaa, a leading activist in the 2011 uprising that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak, was detained in September 2019, six months after his release from a five-year prison term.
Western countries on Friday called on Egypt to end the prosecution of activists, journalists and perceived political opponents under counter-terrorism laws, and to unconditionally release them.
Egypt said it was astonished by the statement, which it called groundless.

Amdouni had been involved in protests, calling for social and economic justice and against police abuse.

Activists said Amdouni had increasingly been targeted since February as she became a visible part of the daily protests in the capital.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. officials plan to use data gathered from people who have already been vaccinated against COVID-19 as well as data from ongoing clinical trials to determine when and whether current vaccines need to be updated to address viral variants.
Peter Marks, director of the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a hearing on Wednesday that his agency has already started getting data on vaccine safety from surveillance systems. 
Those systems have been set up to gather reports of vaccine side effects from individuals and physicians and are managed in partnership with the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The FDA is also working with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to mine data in health information systems to look for possible safety signals. 
Marks told a hearing of the House Committee on Energy & Commerce that his agency has already begun to receive data on vaccine safety.
He said the FDA intends to use these surveillance systems to determine whether vaccines continue to be effective in the presence of new variants of the coronavirus, especially those that may be capable of evading protection from vaccines. 
Marks told the panel he expects to start receiving data on whether vaccines are continuing to work within the next few months. He is also continuing to monitor clinical trials for signs of vaccine failure. 
Large numbers of breakthrough infections in which vaccinated people get COVID-19 would suggest that booster shots - using the same or a retooled vaccine targeting specific variants - are needed.

 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc have announced they have begun work on vaccines to address variants should they be needed.

If completed, the spin-off of Defense Industrial Systems' civilian business could help reduce tension between the transitional authority's civilian and military elements, which are sharing power until the end of 2023.
Many civilian politicians view the military's opaque business activities as inappropriate and complain that its profits are not included in the state budget.
""This is a new partnership between the military and civilian components that produced the great December revolution,"" said Information Minister Hamza Balol, in a reference to the ousting of former President Omar al-Bashir, at a news conference at the company's manufacturing complex on the outskirts of Khartoum.
The company hosted Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and other ministers on Wednesday in a rare invitation to civilians to tour its facilities.
Sudan's military took power from al-Bashir in April 2019, after months of protests that began the previous December, then the following August agreed to share power with civilians.
Since then, the economy has weakened, with the government suffering from chronically low revenue.
Sudan's military has been under domestic and international pressure to increase its transparency and contribute more to the national economy. 
The company, like many other large enterprises owned by the military, has yet to release its finances or disclose its holdings to the public.

The death of Stephanie Moraa, and that of a six-month-old baby killed in post-election violence in western Kenya, became a flashpoint for public anger over police brutality. It also put a spotlight on what critics say are inadequate government efforts to prosecute officers who commit crimes. https://reut.rs/3vKNYyK
Kenyan police frequently face accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings from civilians and rights groups, but officers are rarely charged and almost never convicted.
Chief magistrate Francis Andayi of the Magistrates Court at Nairobi Milimani Law Courts wrote in his report that the girl's death was caused by a ""deliberate shooting by a police officer whose identity has been frustrated by police officers covering for one another under the blue code of silence"".
He forwarded his report, seen by Reuters on Wednesday, to the director of public prosecution for further action.
""We shall wait for the next course of action by the director of public prosecutions,"" police spokesman Charles Owino said in response to a request for comment on the inquest report.
Moraa died after being hit in the chest by a stray bullet as police fired to disperse protesters on Aug. 12, 2017, the day after election results were announced. She had been standing on the balcony of her family's apartment in Nairobi's Mathare slum.
Several months after her death, the director of prosecutions ordered the inquest after receiving the findings of an investigation into the killing by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), a government watchdog.
IPOA said the probe was hindered by the police, who did not provide information on matters such as the officers' placement, details that may have helped identify who fired the fatal shot.
Eleven witnesses testified in the inquest, including neighbours and her parents who saw the killing and described it in detail, according to the inquest report published on Monday.
""I am almost certain that if the police service wished to identify and bring to book the officer who took away the life of (Moraa), it would not take them a day to do so,"" the report read.
It noted that the girl's death, and the inability to apprehend the officer who killed her, reflects a habitual reality for Kenyans after the announcement of election results.

ANKARA (Reuters) - A top Turkish prosecutor filed a case with the constitutional court on Wednesday demanding the closure of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) party, in the culmination of a years-long clampdown on parliament's third largest party.
Turkey has a long history of shutting down political parties which it regards as a threat and has in the past banned a series of other pro-Kurdish parties.
The HDP had recently come under intensified pressure, with nationalist allies of President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party (AKP) calling for it to be banned over alleged ties to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group.
That has coincided with falling poll support for the AKP and its nationalist allies as Erdogan's government battles the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The embattled lira extended losses on concerns about the political impact of the move, weakening 2% to 7.64 against the dollar.
""(The HDP) move together with the PKK terrorist group and other linked organisations, they act as a branch of the organisation with the aim of breaking the unity of the state,"" appeals court chief prosecutor Bekir Sahin said in a statement.
The HDP, which has 55 seats in the 600-member parliament, denies any links to the militants.
The PKK is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union. It has fought an insurgency against the state in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey since 1984. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict. 
CAPTIVES KILLED IN IRAQ
Earlier on Wednesday Turkey's parliament stripped prominent HDP deputy and human rights advocate Omer Faruk Gergerlioglu of his seat over a criminal conviction for spreading ""terrorist propaganda"" in a social media post. 
The HDP says Gergerlioglu, who received a 2-1/2 year jail sentence, was punished for sharing on Twitter the link to a news story that included comments from the PKK.
Pressure on the HDP has grown since Turkey said 13 captives, including Turkish military and police personnel, were executed by PKK militants in Iraq during a failed Turkish military operation to rescue them last month.
Authorities have jailed or unseated many HDP lawmakers, mayors and officials in recent years, fuelling concerns about the human rights situation in Turkey.

This month Erdogan announced a plan to strengthen rights to a fair trial and freedom of expression, but his critics say it is just a public relations exercise.

France, which has more nuclear reactors than any country other than the United States, is looking to ringfence nuclear operations at the nation's biggest utility.
The reforms, which have sparked wrangling with the European Union and labour unions, involve raising price guarantees on nuclear power that state-controlled EDF sells to third-party providers, helping the debt-laden utility cover its costs. 
The government has recapitalised EDF in the past and has for now agreed to take dividend payouts in shares to alleviate pressure on the company's finances.
A crowded parliamentary agenda is piling pressure on France to reach a deal quickly with antitrust authorities in Brussels over the restructuring of EDF, the first step needed before reforms can go ahead. 
Sources told Reuters last week that talks between Paris and the European Commission had entered a make-or-break phase, with end-March seen as a deadline to reach an agreement over antitrust and state aid issues or abandon the plan for now.
Three members of parliament briefed by the prime minister's office on the reforms on Wednesday told Reuters that the window to get a bill through required checks and balances with representatives would be before the autumn. 
Two said that June to October would be crucial. 
A spokesman for the prime minister's office confirmed this timetable, saying that parliament would be tied up with other bills until June and was scheduled to work on 2022 budget plans from the autumn. 
Delaying the reform, which has been championed by French President Emmanuel Macron, would hurt EDF's ability to make needed investment, EDF has said. France relies on EDF's fleet of reactors, which are now on average about 35 years old, for some 70% of its electricity.
Macron's party currently has a majority in parliament but the reform plan, which has prompted EDF unions to hold strikes, if not agreed this year may be too politically sensitive to pursue during 2022's election campaign, when parliament will have to temporarily shut and the outcome is uncertain. 

Shares in EDF spiked as much as 4.5% on Wednesday before paring gains to trade up 1.2% by 1551 GMT.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said in an interview broadcast on Wednesday that it will be “tough” for him to meet a May 1 deadline to withdraw the last troops from Afghanistan, ending America's longest war.
Biden’s comments to ABC News were his most extensive to date about the deadline set in an accord struck with the Taliban under former President Donald Trump in February 2020.
His interview aired a day before Russia, China, the United States, Pakistan, a delegation of top Afghan officials and opposition leaders and Taliban negotiators meet in Moscow in an attempt to kickstart deadlocked peace talks.
Some U.S. officials and many experts fear that if U.S.-led international forces depart before a peace deal is reached, Afghanistan could plunge into a new civil war, giving al Qaeda a new sanctuary.
“I am in the process of making that decision now as to when they will leave,” Biden said of the last 2,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. “It could happen, but it is tough.”
Biden said Trump's agreement was not “very solidly negotiated.” Even so, Biden has retained as his own peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, the veteran U.S. diplomat who worked the deal out for Trump.
The Taliban has warned it could resume attacks on U.S.-led international forces if Biden misses the deadline.
The 2020 accord specified a phased conditions-based U.S. withdrawal. Trump ordered it to proceed despite a surge in violence blamed mostly on the Taliban, a six-month delay in intra-Afghan peace talks and what U.S. officials say is the Taliban’s failure to fulfill a commitment to cut ties with al Qaeda. This diluted U.S. negotiating leverage.
The Taliban has denied that al Qaeda fighters remain in Afghanistan, where the insurgents provided the Islamist extremists with sanctuary as they planned the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The Taliban deny responsibility for the escalating violence.
On taking office, Biden ordered a review of the 2020 deal.
But in retaining Khalilzad, Biden adopted in large part a proposed peace accord drafted at the end of Trump administration calling for U.S.-backed Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to surrender power to an interim administration, half of whose members the Taliban would select.

Ghani has repeatedly rejected standing aside, saying elections should decide a change in government. The Taliban reject democratic elections and the nationwide ceasefire called for by the U.S. proposal.

Some lawyers familiar with the energy sector do not believe the law is likely to be declared unconstitutional if the government can provide adequate guarantees to existing investments.
Still, the power market shake-up has soured the mood for some investors, and providers of renewable energy are concerned that the changes threaten their businesses in Mexico.
Lopez Obrador argues the previous administration skewed the electricity market in favor of private operators with its own constitutional overhaul. Earlier this month, the leftist leader said he would renegotiate existing contracts in the industry.
Some companies were eager to reach a deal with the government, Lopez Obrador said, without naming any. However, there would need to be ""discounts,"" he said.

Trade experts say that a repeal of the last government's energy reform could breach Mexico's commitments to investors under a regional trade deal it initially sealed in 2018, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

""The plane was identified as a hostile target due to a mistake by the air defence operator...near Tehran and two missiles were fired at it,"" the report said in its summary, published on the agency's website.
""The flight's operation did not have a role in creating the error by the air defence battery,"" the report added.
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards shot down the Ukraine International Airlines flight with ground-to-air missiles on Jan. 8, 2020 shortly after it took off from Tehran.
The Iranian government later declared that the shooting down was a ""disastrous mistake"" by forces who were on high alert during a regional confrontation with the United States.

Iran was on edge about possible attacks after it fired missiles at Iraqi bases housing U.S. forces in retaliation for the killing days before of its most powerful military commander, Qassem Soleimani, in a U.S. missile strike at Baghdad airport.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - The suspect in the fatal shooting of eight people at day spas in and around Atlanta on Tuesday indicated he had issues with sexual addiction and the shootings may have not been motivated by racial hatred, law enforcement officials said on Wednesday.
Officials said that suspect Robert Aaron Long, 21, appeared to have frequented the spas where the violence occurred or similar ones, and that he had been headed to Florida afterward, perhaps to carry out further shootings.
Six of the eight victims were women of Asian descent. While preliminary investigations appeared to suggest the suspect was not motivated by racial hatred, officials said it was still too early to know with certainty. 
The shootings were latest instance of gun violence involving numerous deaths in the United States. The bloodshed began about 5 p.m. on Tuesday when four people were killed and another was wounded in a shooting at Young's Asian Massage in Cherokee County, about 40 miles (64 km) north of Atlanta, Captain Jay Baker of the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department said.
Two women of Asian descent were among the dead there, along with a white woman and a white man, Baker said, adding that the surviving victim was a Hispanic man. 
In Atlanta, Georgia's state capital, police officers responding to a call of a ""robbery in progress"" shortly before 6 p.m. arrived at the Gold Spa beauty salon and found three women shot dead, Police Chief Rodney Bryant told reporters.
While investigating the initial report, the officers were called to a separate aromatherapy spa across the street where another woman was found dead from a gunshot wound, Bryant said. All four women killed in Atlanta were of Asian descent.
""The suspect did take responsibility for the shooting,"" Baker told a news conference. ""It's a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate,"" Baker said, referring to the suspect's sexual addiction issues. 
Long, of Woodstock in Cherokee County, was taken into custody in Crisp County, about 150 miles (240 km) south of Atlanta. A photo of Long, who is white, was released by authorities.
Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said, ""This was a tragic day with many victims. But thankfully the suspect was quickly apprehended.""

Gun control is a divisive issue in the United States, which enshrines the right to bear arms in the Constitution. The U.S. House of Representatives last week approved a pair of gun control bills as Democrats seized upon a shifting political landscape that they said improved chances for enacting new laws after years of failed attempts.

SIMAT DE LA VALLDIGNA, Spain (Reuters) - Paralysed from the neck down after suffering a car crash at 19, Rafael Botella, now 35 and in pain, is relieved that the Spanish parliament is set on Thursday to approve a law to allow euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Botella thought of ending his life when agonizing pain confined him to his bed six years ago. Though he has since changed his mind, he wants the option to do so legally. 
Despite opposition from the political right and religious groups, once signed into law, Spain will become the European Union's fourth country to legalise the practice after Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. A similar plan in neighbouring Portugal suffered a setback this week.
""If for some reason someone is tired of living, no one has the power to tell him 'no, you will live because my voters or my ideology tell the contrary',"" Botella told Reuters in his family home in Simat de la Valldigna, in the eastern Valencia region. 
Before getting out of bed became too painful, he led an active lifestyle, skydiving, paragliding and going to hardcore techno music festivals abroad in his wheelchair. 
""I enjoyed life. (The accident) took away my movement but gave me time to do things I could never have done otherwise"", such as visiting a motorcycle racing team before a MotoGP race, he said.
When the pain became unbearable, he sought help from the Spanish Association for the Right to Die with Dignity, which convinced him to try different medical solutions and keep himself busy with projects.
'BULLET IN THE CHAMBER' 
In the care of his 75-year-old mother, he tries to keep the pain in check by doing brain exercises, is writing a book on his experience and making a short film about the problems faced by a paralysed person against the backdrop of techno festivals. 
Using his nose, he has learned to mix music on his computer and edit videos, and hosts live DJ sessions via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Nevertheless, he wants to have all options available:
""I want a bullet in the chamber so that if I ever need it, I can use it,"" he said, in a figurative reference to medically-assisted suicide. 
""If I don't need it, all the better. We all need that bullet, we can all fall into a very dour situation.""
Almost 90% of Spaniards are in favour of decriminalising the practice, according to a 2019 opinion poll. But for now, helping someone end their life carries a jail term of up to 10 years. Once the new bill enters into force euthanasia and assisted suicide for people with serious and incurable or debilitating diseases that cause unbearable suffering, will be legal.
Euthanasia has long grabbed public attention in Spain, which has the world's fourth-highest life expectancy, and more notably so since paralysed man Ramon Sampedro recorded his assisted suicide in 1998 after being denied that right by courts. 
His story was taken to the screen in 2004 Oscar-winning film ""The Sea Inside"".
In 2019, Spaniard Angel Hernandez was briefly arrested after helping his terminally ill wife end her life, sparking public outcry. He is awaiting trial, facing a potential six-month prison sentence.

""People say it's polemic, but I'd rather consider it an act of love,"" Botella said of Hernandez's case.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The collapse of Lebanon's currency has forced many grocery shops to temporarily shut within the last 24 hours, raising fears that a country reliant on imports could soon face shortages of food.
Food shops around the country were locking their doors, halting online deliveries or restricting customers' orders. Others stayed open, but could not say for how long.
""There's a big possibility we will close if it stays like this. I don't know where will we get supplies, and no one is helping us,"" said Beirut grocer Mohieldin Fayed, who has kept his shop open. 
The pound tumbled to 15,000 to the dollar on Tuesday, losing a third of its value in the last two weeks. It has now sunk by 90% since late 2019.
""If this persists, things will start to disappear, traders will prioritise what to get,"" said Hani Bohsali, head of the foodstuffs importers syndicate. ""We'll have to buy less, in variety and quantity, because we can't find the money."" 
He estimated the country has roughly two months of supplies, while it was getting more and more difficult for importers to obtain the dollars they need to keep buying. 
The economy's collapse has pushed much of the population into poverty and poses the biggest threat to stability since the 1975-1990 civil war. 
Social media users have been sharing videos of supermarket brawls, such as a fight between a man and a woman trying to buy powdered milk. Prices of many consumer goods such as diapers or cereals have nearly tripled during the crisis. 
Nabil Fahed, head of the syndicate of supermarket owners, said some of the shops that had shut on Tuesday reopened on Wednesday after replenishing stocks. But he said permanent closures would happen if no exchange stability was reached. 
""What we're afraid of is that these eventually turn from temporary closures ... that it becomes final because it is a dire situation, their capital is being eroded and they don't have money to pay for goods.""
The vice president of Lebanon's bakeries' syndicate said bakeries were supplying the country with bread for now, but could not do so indefinitely without a solution. Lebanon imports almost all of its wheat. 
""If we continue at this pace, in the end we will reach a forced closure until the exchange rate stabilises,"" Ali Ibrahim, who tried to resign from his position two weeks ago because of the dire situation, said in a statement. 
LOOMING SUBSIDY REMOVAL
Many shops in Lebanon were already shut because of the coronavirus pandemic, and streets have also been closed by roadblocks during anti-government demonstrations. But until this week, groceries had mostly stayed open. Many have been offering deliveries online.
On Tuesday, a number of online grocery shops disappeared from apps. Others refused to accept orders. 
Lebanon's central bank has drawn on already critical foreign reserves to subsidise three key commodities - wheat, fuel and medicine - and a basket of other basic goods, as dollars inflows dried up. It has provided hard currency to importers at the old peg of 1,500 Lebanese pounds to the dollar. 
But the state, fast running out of cash, has signalled multiple times that the subsidies would soon be lifted, although it has yet to give a timeline or announce a plan.
Supermarket syndicate head Fahed said the central bank was often slow to release dollars to food importers, causing shortages which in turn provoke consumers to hoard goods. In one example, he said a supermarket had sold a typical month's stock of 5,000 gallons of subsidised cooking oil in only five hours.
The looming removal of subsidies has triggered fears of shortages, said Nasser Saidi, an economist and former cabinet minister.

""As soon as you announce that subsidies might be lifted or reduced...automatically consumers hoard goods,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Two jurors seated in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer facing murder charges over his arrest of George Floyd, were dismissed on Wednesday after they said news of a $27 million settlement with Floyd's family meant they could no longer be impartial.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill had set aside three weeks for jury selection, beginning last week, and was back down to seven seated jurors after the two dismissals.
Mayor Jacob Frey joined some of Floyd's relatives at a news conference on Friday to announce the city would pay them $27 million to settle their federal wrongful-death lawsuit against the city, one of the largest settlements of its kind.
One of the jurors selected last week told the judge on Wednesday morning that the settlement's size shocked him and ""kind of swayed me a little bit.""
""It kind of sent a message that the city of Minneapolis felt that something was wrong, and they wanted to make it right, to the tune of that dollar amount,"" the juror, a white man in his 30s, told the court. 
Cahill dismissed him and a Hispanic man in his 20s who expressed similar views. Some of the other seated jurors, who have been promised anonymity by the judge for the trial's duration, said they had seen headlines about the settlement, but were able to assure the court it would not influence them.
Chauvin's lead lawyer, Eric Nelson, has complained to the court that publicity around the settlement makes it harder to seat a jury that can be impartial. 
Every potential juror so far has told the court they know who Chauvin is and almost all have seen video of the white police officer with his knee on Floyd's neck as Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, begged for his life. The case sparked global protests against police brutality and racism.
""You have elected officials — the governor, the mayor — making incredibly prejudicial statements about my client, this case,"" Nelson told the court on Tuesday. ""You have the city settling a civil lawsuit for a record amount of money. And the pre-trial publicity is just so concerning.""
He has asked the judge to revisit the defense's earlier request to delay and move the trial to another county, which Cahill has said he will consider.
Cahill agreed with Nelson's request to recall the seven jurors already seated to see if the settlement news might bias them, and they appeared one by one by video conference on Wednesday morning. 
Cahill said earlier news articles, including some reporting that Chauvin had agreed to plead guilty to federal charges last year, were more ""problematic"" than the settlement news.
Chauvin, 44, has pleaded not guilty to charges brought by the Minnesota attorney general's office of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter, and has said he correctly followed his police training. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted on the most serious charge. 
Prosecutors oppose Nelson's efforts to move the trial or dismiss jurors who heard about the settlement.
""I think that this $27 million settlement has been frankly overblown,"" Steve Schleicher, a lawyer for the prosecution, told the court, saying many jurors interviewed since had shown no knowledge of the settlement. 

The court plans to have opening arguments commence on March 29.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican's directive banning the blessing of same-sex unions has sparked defiance among some priests in Europe and left bishops perplexed on how to minister to gay Catholics.
Conservatives praised the ruling, issued on Monday by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, but it greatly disappointed gay Catholics, who felt their Church was becoming more welcoming under Pope Francis.
""I feel vicarious shame for my Church,"" Johan Bonny, the Roman Catholic bishop of Antwerp, Belgium, wrote in a commentary on Wednesday in the Flemish newspaper De Standard.
""I want to apologise to all those for whom this response is painful and incomprehensible... their pain for the Church is mine today ... God has never been stingy or pedantic with His blessing on people,"" he said.
Bonny's response was among the most blunt by a bishop. Others, such as Archbishop Mark Coleridge of Brisbane, Australia, pointed to the challenges the Church now faces.
""It's one thing to say we can't bless same-sex unions. Well let's then commit ourselves to grappling with the question about how else we might include same-sex couples,"" Coleridge said on Wednesday in a webinar with the Catholic magazine The Tablet.
""It's just not enough to say 'we can't, we can't'"".
Father James Martin, a New York Jesuit, said he feared the directive may prompt ""some LGBTQ Catholics to leave the church, after years of feeling rejected and unwelcome."" 
In Germany, more than 1,000 people, most of them priests, had by Wednesday signed a petition in which they said they would not refuse to give blessings, according to Burkhard Hose, a priest who launched an initiative calling for ""pastoral disobedience"".
In some countries, parishes and ministers had begun blessing same-sex unions in lieu of marriage, and there had been calls for bishops to institutionalise de facto such blessings, although the practice caused alarm among conservatives.
SURPRISE RULING 
The ruling, which the pope approved, came as a surprise to many in the 1.3 billion-member Church because he has been more conciliatory towards gay people than perhaps any other pontiff.
He has held meetings with gay couples and encouraged those who want to raise their children in the Church to do so. In 2013 he made the now-famous remark ""Who am I to judge"" about gay people seeking God and trying to live by the Church's rules.
The Catholic Church teaches homosexual tendencies are not sinful but homosexual acts are.
Bill Donohue, president of the U.S.-based Catholic League, which backs conservative views, welcomed the ruling in a statement in which he also criticised bishops in Germany who have expressed support for the blessing of same-sex couples. 
""It is one thing to say all persons possess equal dignity in the eyes of God; it is quite another to say that whatever they do is acceptable to God. Human status and human behaviour are not identical,"" he said.
Cardinal Blase Cupich, the archbishop of Chicago, said the disappointment of gay Catholics was ""understandable,"" and that the Church now had to ""redouble our efforts to be creative and resilient in finding ways to welcome and encourage all LGBTQ people into our family of faith.""
While Coleridge and Cupich, both seen as progressives, appeared to have chosen their words carefully, Tobias Schaefer, the provost of the cathedral in Worms, Germany, did not hide his outrage.

""If the Church does not have the power to bless wherever people yearn for blessing, has it not abandoned its most fundamental duty? Blessings are not a way of passing a moral judgement!"" Schaefer said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), adding he would disobey the directive.

SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday China was acting aggressively and repressively, and accused North Korea of committing ""systemic and widespread abuses"" against its own people.
Blinken's remarks disclosed a fissure in Washington and Seoul's approach to China and North Korea, openly pressing South Korea to join hands in keeping Beijing in check and improving Pyongyang's human rights violations.
Blinken is visiting Japan and South Korea alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a first overseas trip by top-level members of President Joe Biden's administration aimed at rebuilding U.S. alliances in Asia. 
At talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong in Seoul, Blinken said China was using ""coercion and aggression,"" citing its posturing over Taiwan and Hong Kong and in the East and South China Seas where it has territorial disputes with Japan and other Asian nations. 
China's extensive territorial claims in the East and South China Seas have become a priority issue in increasingly testy relations between Washington and Beijing. 
Beijing's territorial ambitions have prompted Japan to seek even closer ties with the United States, but the Sino-U.S. rivalry posed a challenge for Seoul, which is not eager to provoke China, its largest economic partner and a key North Korea ally.
""China is using coercion and aggression to systematically erode the autonomy in Hong Kong, undercut democracy in Taiwan, abuse human rights and its regime in Tibet and assert maritime claims in the South China Sea that violate international law,"" Blinken said. 
China's foreign ministry protested the joint statement, calling it a ""malicious attack"" and ""gross interference in China's internal affairs.""
Blinken urged Seoul to ""stand up to shared values"" together to prevent a ""dangerous erosion of democracy"" in the region. 
He told an online roundtable of Japanese journalists in Tokyo earlier on Wednesday that China was raising tensions by ""acting both more repressively at home and more aggressively abroad."" 
The comments echoed a joint statement issued by Blinken, Austin and their Japanese counterparts after ""2+2"" talks in Tokyo, and come ahead of Blinken's first in-person meetings with Chinese counterparts planned for later this week in Alaska. 
""We look forward to the opportunity to lay out in very clear terms to our Chinese counterparts some of the concerns that we have about the actions they're taking,"" said Blinken.
'AUTHORITARIAN REGIME' 
Blinken sharply criticized North Korea's human rights record, an issue that activists say was overlooked under former U.S. President Donald Trump, who held unprecedented summits and boasted of rapport with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 
South Korea has faced international scrutiny after supporting a new law banning the launching of anti-Kim leaflets into the North and canceling licenses of some defector groups that had led the campaign.
President Moon Jae-in's administration, keen to revive cross-border exchanges, has said those leaflets had caused safety concerns and North Korean human rights could be improved by resuming humanitarian aid.
""The authoritarian regime in North Korea continues to commit systemic and widespread abuses against its own people,"" Blinken told Chung. ""We must stand with the people that demand fundamental rights and freedom against those who repress them."" 
The State Department issued a statement saying both officials agreed to work together to resolve North Korea's nuclear and missile issues, calling them a ""priority.""
South Korea's foreign ministry said they also agreed to continue discussions to arrange a summit between Moon and Biden as early as possible, and to coordinate on North Korea as Washington's policy is under way. 
Austin held separate talks with South Korean Defense Minister Suh Wook and pledged to continue providing extended deterrence, including the U.S. nuclear umbrella, Seoul's defense ministry said in a statement. 
Both sides also reaffirmed their shared goal of achieving complete denuclearization and lasting peace on the Korean peninsula, the ministry said. 
""The alliance has never been more important,"" Austin said at the meeting, citing ""unprecedented challenges"" posed by North Korea and China. 
Austin called the alliance a ""key provider"" of peace, security and prosperity in Northeast Asia, and for a free and open Indo-Pacific region and beyond. 
Suh said it was important for the allies to maintain a strong deterrence and joint defense posture against North Korea, and vowed to strengthen relations. 

Blinken and Austin were set to hold talks with their South Korean counterparts and meet President Moon and other senior officials until Thursday.

Kenya criminalised FGM in 2011 with a punishment of three years imprisonment and a $2,000 fine, but the practice persists because some communities regard it as necessary for social acceptance and increasing their daughters' marriage prospects.
An estimated 200 million girls and women worldwide have been subjected to FGM, which usually involves the partial or total removal of the external genitalia. 
The ritual is practised in at least 27 African countries and parts of Asia and the Middle East.
The court was ruling on a petition seeking to legalize FGM on the grounds that the ban is unconstitutional and that adult women should be allowed to do what they want with their bodies.
""We find that limiting this right is reasonable in an open and democratic society, based on the dignity of women,"" said judge Lydia Achode. ""The amended petition is devoid of merit and hereby dismissed."" 
The petition was brought in 2017 by a female doctor, Tatu Kamau, who said that women were being harassed and arrested for undergoing FGM.
""I am disappointed,"" Kamau said, adding that she accepted the verdict. 
One in five women and girls aged between 15 and 49 in Kenya have undergone some form of the procedure, according to the U.N. Fund for Population Activities, the U.N.'s sexual and reproductive health agency. 

President Uhuru Kenyatta has pledged to end FGM by 2022, but women's rights groups say that target is not realistic due to crime and insecurity, the remoteness of many locations and high prevalence rates in some areas of the country.

Earlier this month, Russia's foreign-facing state television station RT accused the German government of putting pressure on lenders, including Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), to close the bank account of its German office. 
Germany has denied that while Commerzbank declined to comment on individual clients.
Russian-based German journalists were summoned to a video conference on Monday at which, according to a participant, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warned that Moscow would have to respond if Berlin did not back down over RT.
""Press freedom is not up for negotiation,"" Maas wrote on Twitter. ""That is possible in Germany and it must be the case in Russia too.""
The spat adds to strains between Russia and the West.
Though heavily dependent on Russia for energy imports, Germany has condemned the imprisonment of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who was arrested on his return from Germany after treatment for poisoning in Russia.
Showing the importance to Russia of the goodwill of Germany, a major buyer of its energy, RT last November promised a full German-language TV channel in addition to its current online selection of programmes.

Several countries, including the United States, have labelled RT state propaganda, while British regulators have repeatedly investigated it for breaches of impartiality rules.

Locked in war for more than six years, the country is already suffering from the world's worst humanitarian crisis and the situation is at risk of deteriorating further, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said.
""Yemen is approaching the point of no return. If we make the wrong choice now, Yemen will experience the worst famine the world has seen in decades,"" UNOCHA Yemen coordinator David Gressley said. 
Agencies last year faced a severed funding shortfall which led to various programmes - including food aid - being scaled back. 
At a March 1 conference, donors pledged only $1.7 billion of the $3.85 billion needed in the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan. 
""To date, only $374 million has been disbursed to aid agencies,"" UNOCHA said. 
More than 16.2 million people face hunger in 2021, including nearly 50,000 people who are already experiencing famine-like conditions, it said.
The humanitarian crisis has been exacerbated by a civil war that broke out when the Houthi movement seized control of the capital Sanaa in September 2014, forcing the then government into exile in Riyadh and Aden. In March the following year, a Saudi-led coalition intervened to try to restore Hadi's government, carrying out thousands of air raids.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed, mostly civilians.
U.S. President Joe Biden has made ending the war in Yemen a priority, and the United States and the United Nations have made renewed diplomatic efforts this year. 
But the U.N.'s Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths on Monday said the war is ""back in full force"", with military action intensifying on several fronts.

The popularity of the cheap, low-flying drones, and their potential for ferrying anything from pizzas to prescription drugs between businesses and homes, has stirred fears of mid-air collisions or crashes that could cause casualties on the ground. 
""This is an opportunity for the regulators to learn what is needed to establish delivery drones as a daily reality, and for the drone operators to learn what is expected of them in turn,"" said Hagit Lidor of the Israel Innovation Authority, one of several state agencies involved in the test.
In the first live trial of a two-year test phase launched in January, rural Hadera's airspace was turned over to five private firms that flew drones on criss-cross runs designed to test the responses of a control room in the city of Haifa, 56 km (35 miles) away.
To keep the drones - which went up 20 at a time - no more than 120 metres (yards) above ground and no less than 60 metres (yards) apart, the control-room staff sent alerts and rerouting instructions to their operators electronically. 
""For the first time, we are managing airspace as a single entity, synthesising drone operators with established civil and military aviation,"" said Lidor.
She added regulated commercial drone deliveries in Israel were unlikely before 2023, when the testing is due to end and related matters like legislation would have to be addressed.
Organisers said helicopters or planes were not a planned part of Wednesday's trial but may be involved in a follow-up in June. Piloted aircraft more commonly seen at low altitudes around Hadera are crop-dusters and paragliders. The drones were told to steer clear of these by at least a 1 km (half a mile).

All of the drones were equipped with parachutes, to ensure safe landings should they suffer malfunctions, Lidor added.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt is racing to prepare a grandiose new capital city in the desert east of Cairo before the first civil servants move in this summer and ahead of the delayed official opening of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's flagship project.
At the heart of the city, workers are putting finishing touches to an avenue of ministries that echo the architecture of pharaonic temples and adjoin a raised Islamic complex, two domed parliament buildings and a sprawling presidential compound.
There will be a monorail passing through a business district where a 385-metre central tower is close to completion. Beyond, the contours of a 10km park stretching to a giant mosque are taking shape.
The city, known simply as the New Administrative Capital, is designed to operate with smart technology on virgin land away from the clutter and chaos of Cairo. It will boast universities, leisure facilities and a diplomatic quarter.
But it has made halting progress, and after Emirati funding fell through shortly after it was announced in 2015, the military and government took on the estimated $25 billion cost of the first phase, injecting off-budget investment.
Some foreign loans and financing have been secured.
The coronavirus pandemic also slowed progress, and the first of three planned phases, covering 168 square kilometres, will not be completed when the government begins to move in.
""The rate of completion of the first phase has passed 60% across all projects,"" said Khaled el-Husseiny, spokesman for the new capital.
He added that the delayed transfer of civil servants would begin in July, ahead of an official opening planned for the end of 2021. 
HI-TECH
The city is being designed as a high-tech model for Egypt's future.
Control centres will monitor infrastructure and security electronically, roofs will be covered in solar panels, payments will be cashless and 15 square metres of green space are allocated per inhabitant, officials said. 
""We are trying to solve all the problems we had in the past in the new capital,"" said Husseiny.
The finished city is expected to house at least 6 million residents, its second and third phases largely residential.
That will take decades to complete, although the government will be able to function normally while construction goes on, said Amr Khattab, spokesman for the Housing Ministry which is responsible for executing parts of the city.
How far and how fast Egypt's centre of gravity shifts away from Cairo to the new capital 45 km from the Nile is unclear. For now, thousands of residential blocks stand empty either side of a highway leading into the new city.
The completion of the business district, yet to be marketed, is set for 2023.
Electric train and monorail links are under construction. The first 50,000 civil servants expected to relocate to the new capital from this summer will be offered shuttle buses to get there.
Around 5,000 out of 20,000 housing units have been sold in the first residential district expected to open in May, said Khattab.
On Monday, Sisi's office announced 1.5 billion Egyptian pounds ($96 million) in incentives for civil servants selected to move to the city. 
LAND SALES
Officials say the city will eventually include social housing and is meant to finance itself through land sales, though it is unclear how much revenue these have generated.
Of the $25 billion cost for the first phase, about $3 billion is being spent on the government district, said Husseiny. 
Some international financing has been secured for rail links, and a $3 billion Chinese loan has helped fund the business district, built by China State Construction Engineering Corp (CSCEC).
Sisi, who has embarked on multiple infrastructure mega-projects and national development schemes, says other regions will not be neglected.
""We are not leaving Cairo, or Alexandria or Port Said or other provinces. We are moving forward with the old and the new together,"" the president said last week. The capital's opening would mark the ""birth of a new state"", he added.
Though there is support for the government's argument that the new capital can reduce congestion in Cairo, there is also concern that it will be unaffordable and inaccessible to many.

""Some classes will be able to live there, others won't,"" said Alaa Ibrahim, a 39-year-old electrician in Cairo's impoverished Imbaba district.

ARGUINEGUIN, Spain (Reuters) - Spanish health workers resuscitated a toddler who was among 52 sub-Saharan African migrants rescued off the island of Gran Canaria in the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday, a Reuters witness and Spanish authorities said. 
Shortly after a Coast Guard boat carrying the migrants, many of them suffering from hypothermia, docked at the Gran Canaria port of Arguineguin, two Red Cross medics rushed over and started performing CPR chest compressions on a young girl lying on the concrete pier. 
""Call an ambulance, call 112,"" says one of the health workers, before both can be heard saying with relief, ""She's alive"". More health workers then carried the child, wrapped in a red blanket, off to an ambulance, Reuters footage showed. 
The toddler was one of 10 people, including six children and a pregnant woman, who had to be rushed to the hospital due to hypothermia, according to the Canary Islands emergency service.
Other migrants waited patiently on the deck while those in need of medical attention were taken ashore.
The number of undocumented migrants arriving in Spain's Canary Islands rose eight-fold last year from 2019, with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourism and other industries in north and sub-Saharan Africa pushing many more to embark on the dangerous journey.

Hundreds died or went missing last year after attempting the crossing to the Spanish islands in the Atlantic Ocean, often in rickety, overcrowded boats with unreliable engines, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR has said.

Outgoing Director General Audrey Azoulay was appointed in 2017 after a bitter campaign. Her mandate was to revive the organisation's fortunes after the United States, which provided a fifth of its funding, pulled out.
The election is due in November, but without an opponent and a majority of the 58 Executive Board member states, including biggest financial contributor China, backing her, she should be elected for another four years. 
The agency, founded in the ashes of World War Two to protect the common cultural inheritance of humanity, is best known for designating and protecting archaeological and heritage sites, from the Galapagos (NASDAQ:GLPG) Islands to the tombs of Timbuktu.
Most of its activities are uncontroversial, but issues such as resolutions about how religious sites should be run in Jerusalem have been highly charged and the United States quit over accusations of anti-Israeli bias by the body.
The official told Reuters that the signals from the new U.S. administration were positive and that the objective was to make progress on the issue over the coming months.
UNESCO has had to fill a gaping financial hole. The United States left with $542 million in arrears. A U.S. return, done through a letter informing the body, would also mean that Washington would repay its arrears at some stage.
Things may still prove complicated given a U.S. law that forbids Washington from funding U.N. bodies that have admitted Palestine as a full member, although a waiver can be sought.

In its most forthright condemnation of the military's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations, the government-appointed organisation also said in a draft statement its members intended to halt activities, in an apparent protest. 
The State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee planned to release a final statement after consulting the religious affairs minister on Thursday, the Myanmar Now news portal said, citing a monk who attended a meeting of the committee.
Monks have a long history of activism in Myanmar and were at the forefront of a 2007 ""Saffron Revolution"" against military rule, an uprising that, although suppressed, helped usher in democratic reforms.
Committee members could not immediately be reached for comment, but their reported stance would signal a significant rift between authorities and a group that usually works closely with the government.
Pope Francis also appealed for an end to the bloodshed, saying: ""Even I kneel on the streets of Myanmar and say 'stop the violence'.""
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government on Feb. 1, detaining her and members of her party, drawing international condemnation.
Ousted members of parliament, most from Suu Kyi's party, pushed for a united stand against the coup in the ethnically diverse country, saying the designation of terrorist would be lifted from all autonomy-seeking insurgents fighting for democracy.
More than 180 protesters have been killed as security forces try to crush a wave of demonstrations, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group says.
Protesters confronted security forces over a sand-bag barricade on one street in the city of Yangon. Police opened intermittent fire and one man appeared to get shot in the head, according to footage on social media. 
Reuters could not verify the video. Media reported that authorities forced some Yangon residents to dismantle barricades and threatened to open fire in neighbourhoods that didn't take them down.
Two protesters were killed in the central town of Kale, the BBC reported, while several hundred people gathered in Demoso town in the east, Pathein in the Irrawaddy river delta and Dawei in the south, pictures on social media showed.
Residents of the second city of Mandalay and the central town of Monywa also reported protests.
A total mobile internet shutdown made it difficult for protesters to communicate and to verify information. Very few people in Myanmar have access to Wi-Fi.
""We use a guerrilla protest system. We tell people to disperse if security forces come,"" Chit Chit Win, a member of a women's protest group, told Reuters from Dawei. 
""We're avoiding confrontation but doing what we can.""
A team of U.N. investigators appealed for people to collect documentary evidence of crimes ordered by the military in order to build cases against its leaders.
A junta spokesman did not answer telephone calls seeking comment. 
DEADLY PAY DISPUTE
Parts of Yangon are under martial law and thousands of residents have fled the industrial suburb of Hlaingthaya where security forces killed 40 people on Sunday and Chinese-financed factories were set ablaze.
Workers said a dispute over pay at a Chinese-owned factory in the industrial zone turned violent on Tuesday after the owner called the security forces who shot dead a woman labour leader and then at least four more people. Myanmar Now said six people were killed.
China's state media have warned of unspecified action if there are further attacks on Chinese-owned businesses. 
Many people in Myanmar believe Beijing is backing the military. Unlike Western powers, China has not condemned the coup and, along with Russia, has prevented the U.N. Security Council from denouncing the military's actions.
The junta has charged the acting leader of a parallel civilian government, Mahn Win Khaing Than, with treason, the Democratic Voice of Burma reported.
Mahn Win Khaing Than, who is on the run, is a senior member of Suu Kyi's party. He was appointed this month by a panel of ousted lawmakers pushing for recognition as the rightful government.
The ousted parliamentarians also said they recognised all insurgent groups committed to a ""federal democratic union"" and thanked them for helping coup opponents who had fled to their zones.
""Evil must be repelled by our united hands,"" the politicians said on Twitter.
The army said it took power after its accusations of fraud in a Nov. 8 election won by Suu Kyi's party were rejected by the electoral commission.
It has promised a new election but not set a date.

Suu Kyi, 75, has been detained since the coup and faces various charges including illegally importing walkie-talkie radios and infringing coronavirus protocols.

478,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 08:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mexico plans push to contain migration near Guatemala border - sources,"By Dave Graham (NYSE:GHM), Diego Oré and Laura Gottesdiener
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico is preparing to significantly reinforce efforts to detain migrants who illegally cross its border with Guatemala in response to a jump in people trying to enter the United States, according to four people familiar with the matter.
The U.S. government said this week it is facing the biggest migrant surge on its border with Mexico in 20 years, presenting authorities a major challenge and sparking concerns inside the Mexican government.
The people familiar with the plan said Mexico would deploy security forces to cut the flow of migrants, the bulk of whom come from three poor and often violent Central American countries whose economies have been battered in the coronavirus pandemic - the so-called Northern Triangle of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.
Two of the people said Mexico's National Guard militarized police, which led efforts to bring down migrant numbers during an increase in 2019, would be at the fore of the containment drive.
""The operations will be more frequent, more continuous and we will be taking part,"" from next week, a member of the National Guard said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The people did not give details of the plan, but similar operations in the past have focused on a narrow isthmus in the south of the country, rather then trying to stop all crossings on the Guatemalan border where remote and difficult terrain complicates efforts. 
Migration authorities are already picking up migrants without proper paperwork around the southern city of Tapachula near the border, the National guardsman said.
Mexico's National Migration Institute said it had no information on the matter. Mexico's National Guard and the office of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador did not immediately respond. 
When asked about the Mexican plan, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said the United States appreciated Mexico's efforts to stem the flows and aimed to continue close cooperation.
The official declined to comment on specific operations and did not respond to a question on whether the White House had requested such action or knew about it in advance. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
After taking office in December 2018, Lopez Obrador created the National Guard to deal with internal security, but ended up deploying thousands of its troopers to curb migration under pressure from the previous U.S. president, Donald Trump, a Republican.
Trump's successor, Democrat Joe Biden, has adopted a more humanitarian approach to migration policy. But the surge in arrivals since he took office in January has tested U.S. authorities and drawn heavy criticism from Republicans.
A sense of urgency has mounted within the Biden administration amid pressure over the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, especially over increasing numbers of unaccompanied minors apprehended there.
In Washington, a person familiar with the matter said the new U.S. administration has seen a growing need for the Mexican government to do more to secure its southern border but has steered clear of making demands or direct requests for action. 
Biden's aides want to avoid Trump's heavy-handed approach to Mexico, preferring a more respectful tone on the divisive issue of migration, but bilateral discussions have touched upon how to curb the flow from the Northern Triangle countries, the source said on condition of anonymity.
Mexican officials had anticipated a sharp escalation in immigration under Biden, with one ruefully noting last month that it would force Mexico ""to be the bad guys again.""

The rise in illegal immigration has created a lucrative business for criminal gangs inside Mexico, which is already coping with near record levels of homicides, officials say.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden has powered through the COVID-19 crisis with an economy set to regain its pre-pandemic size by late-2021, but a surge in unemployment among its foreign-born citizens risks exacerbating social divisions for years to come.
Stockholm's rejection of lockdowns left the country an outlier in Europe. The decision came at the cost of higher infection rates than its Nordic neighbours but has helped spare the local economy. Europe as a whole will not see output return to pre-pandemic levels until 2022.
The headline numbers however, hide wide differences in the experience of Swedes in negotiating the coronavirus.
Bakir Ajlan ran a taxi firm in the southern city of Malmo until mid-2020, when the pandemic forced him to shut up shop and lay off 15 drivers, mostly foreign-born Swedes like himself. 
""There were lots of customers,"" he said. ""But now there aren't any after 9 or 10 in the evening. There's nothing to do.""
Ajlan came to Sweden as a 17-year-old from Baghdad in 1993. Despite graduating with a degree in Middle Eastern Studies from Lund University - one of the country's best schools - he only found work as a taxi driver.
A rigid labour market and a lack of low-skilled jobs means Sweden has been poor at integrating waves of immigrants, or ""new Swedes"", since the 1970s - a social and economic divide that has been widened further.
Those with full-time work – most Swedish-born citizens - have been supported by furlough schemes and relatively few have lost their jobs. But contract workers and the self-employed - often foreign-born - have been badly hit.
Unemployment among foreign-born workers stood at 18% in the fourth quarter of last year, up 3.5 percentage points from a year earlier, according to Statistics Office data. For people born in Sweden, it was 4.1%, up just 1 percentage point.
Swedish central bank Governor Stefan Ingves acknowledged this month that there are ""big, big differences"" in what people are experiencing across the labour market as a whole.
WORSENING SOCIAL DIVIDE
Immigration has been running at high levels for the past two decades in Sweden, with a record 163,000 asylum seekers arriving in the country of 10 million in 2015.
Many of the most recent arrivals have yet to find jobs and research covering the last few decades shows 50% of immigrants take between five and 10 years to secure employment.
While economy is expected to bounce back after shrinking a relatively mild 2.8% last year and many jobs should return, worries are growing that the longer the crisis lasts the more people will slip into longer-term joblessness.
A record 180,000 Swedes had been unemployed for a year or more in February, up 26,000 on the same month a year ago and the figure is expected to continue rising, according to the Public Employment Service.
That in turn will do little to alleviate the divide between the ""haves"" and ""have nots"" that has blighted many immigrant-dominated suburbs in Sweden's biggest cities, already suffering from crime linked to gangs and drugs.
""If you look at the development in Sweden, long-term unemployment is one of the factors that creates social exclusion,"" Ali Esbati, a Swedish member of parliament and spokesman on employment issues for the Left Party said.
""It's part of a long trend in Sweden of growing economic division which has been caused by changes in tax policy, pressure on public services, etc, and these have meant that the social divide in Sweden has increased.""
LONG-TERM CHALLENGE
The government has launched a raft of measures - some of which predate the pandemic - aimed at getting people into work, including subsidized employment, tax breaks for employers, on-the-job training schemes and its ""knowledge-lift"" programme that offers study opportunities for the unemployed.
Its economic package of emergency COVID-19 measures is worth around 400 billion Swedish crowns ($47.01 billion).
""Rising long-term unemployment is one of the most important challenges we face in the wake of the pandemic,"" Employment Minister Eva Nordmark said in a written comment.
""During the spring, we will launch an 'intensive year' for newly arrived (immigrants) so that they can get a job within a year,"" she added, referring to programmes that include Swedish lessons, work experience and social orientation.
But analysts are worried Sweden's fragmented political landscape will undermine attempts to build a consensus around the kind of long-term measures needed to address the problem. 
A proposal last year to give employers more flexibility in hiring and firing by easing strict ""first-in-last-out"" rules nearly brought down the centre-left government, which relies on small parties on the centre-right and the Left Party to remain in power.
Former taxi operator Ajlan, meanwhile, is seeking a different line of work. ""I hope things will come back,"" he said. ""We have to cross our fingers. I can't do much more than that.""

PARIS (Reuters) - A year to the day since France entered its first lockdown, Paris residents reflected on what they have lost -- and in some cases gained -- over 12 months when the COVID-19 pandemic turned daily life upside down.
Summer Arend, from the United States, came to Paris four years ago and worked as a sommelier in a restaurant, an industry forced to close because of the pandemic.
The stress of long periods locked down in her small apartment contributed to the breakup of her relationship with her boyfriend, she said.
Yet looking back over the past year, she saw positives. 
""It really put things in perspective for me. Having the time off has given me a lot of time to think about my life, and the next steps,"" she said.
From midday on March 17, 2020, all non-essential businesses were ordered to close, office workers stayed home, and for almost two months, people could only step outside for essential trips or an hour of exercise per day.
The lockdown was eased by the summer, then re-imposed at the end of October, then eased again at the end of last year. Now, with severe COVID-19 cases rising, French officials say Paris may have to go back into some form of lockdown.
Anne Stephan works in museums, another mainstay of Parisian life shut because of the pandemic. 
""I fluctuate between moments of anxiety and moments, not of optimism, but of hope. I would say that as time goes, anxiety has grown in me a little bit more than at the beginning of the lockdown,"" she said.
Serge Ristitch, a 61-year-old sound engineer, said the hardest parts of the past year were not being able to ride his bicycle, or visit museums to indulge his passion for art.
""It was very hard, and hard to accept psychologically,"" he said.

A Palestinian Health Ministry spokesman said 38,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine would be used for inoculations as of Sunday, while 24,000 doses of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine would be stored ""until there is a scientific decision from the World Health Organization"".
The WHO, one of the leaders of the COVAX programme, has said its advisory panel was reviewing reports from several countries of isolated cases of bleeding, blood clots and low platelet counts after administration of the AstraZeneca shots.
But the organisation appealed to nations on Monday not to pause vaccination campaigns over the safety fears.
The vaccines shipped to Tel Aviv were the first sent by the WHO to the Palestinians under the COVAX drive it set up with the GAVI vaccine alliance to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccinations globally.
Further COVAX shipments are expected in a few months.
A truck brought the initial shipment from Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport to the Palestinian city of Ramallah in the West Bank. About a third of the doses have been allocated for Gaza.
An official in the office of the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process said the vaccines ""will be critical tools in our fight against the pandemic and for socioeconomic recovery"".
The Palestinian Authority hopes to cover about 20% of the Palestinian population through the COVAX initiative. It said the initial doses from COVAX would be given to health workers, cancer and kidney patients and people over the age of 75.
The West Bank, where 3.1 million Palestinians live, has reported 146,359 coronavirus cases, with 1,667 deaths. Gaza, with a population of two million, has registered more than 57,891 cases with 572 deaths.
Health officials in Gaza said some 8,500 people had received the first dose of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine. In the West Bank, about 5,000 have had their first shot.

About 90,000 of the 120,000 Palestinian labourers who have Israeli work permits have been vaccinated by Israel, which has been a world leader in its vaccination rollout.

France is the only country in the European Union to allow the catching of birds, in parts of the south, by pasting glue on sticks or tree trunks, or using snares and nets, despite a 1979 EU ban.
""A member state may not authorise a method of capture of birds ... which is likely to cause other than negligible harm to the species concerned,"" the court said in a statement.
Under a 1989 decree allowing glue trapping as long as it is ""selective, controlled and in limited quantity"", France has allowed the practice every year despite protests by bird lovers.
""It's a great victory for the Bird Protection Association, which has been advocating for years"" against the practice, the association said in a statement.
The association says glue trapping is a ""cruel and odious"" practice from a bygone era and that France should join other EU nations in outlawing it completely.
The injuries suffered by the birds were acknowledged by the EU Court of Justice, which argued that the captured birds can sustain irreparable harm, since the glue can damage feathers.

The French Ecology Ministry has yet to react to the decision. In August 2020, President Emmanuel Macron suspended glue trapping pending a ruling by the court.

During the interview aired by U.S. television network CBS on March 7, Meghan said one unnamed member of the royal family had asked how dark their son Archie's skin might be when he was born, while Harry said his father, heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, had let him down and that he had felt trapped.
At an engagement last Thursday, Prince William said he had not yet spoken to his brother but intended to do so, telling reporters: ""We're very much not a racist family.""
Gayle King, the co-host of CBS This Morning, said she had spoken to Harry and Meghan at the weekend and that a conversation between the brothers had taken place.
""It's true, Harry has talked to his brother and he has talked to his father too, and the word I was given was that those conversations were not productive, but they are glad that they have at least started a conversation,"" she said.
William's office Kensington Palace had no comment on King's remarks. 
Harry and Meghan's interview plunged the British monarchy into its biggest crisis since the death of William and Harry's mother Princess Diana in 1997.
'HEARTBREAKING' 
It came after Buckingham Palace said it was investigating allegations of bullying made against Meghan by aides before she and Harry gave up their royal roles to move to California last year.
""I think what is still upsetting to them is that the palace keeps saying they want to work it out privately yet they've all these false stories coming out that are very disparaging against Meghan,"" King said.
""I think it's frustrating for them to see that it's a racial conversation about the royal family when all they wanted all along was for the royals to intervene and tell the press to stop with the unfair, inaccurate, false stories that definitely have a racial slant.""
Queen Elizabeth, 94, has said the royals were saddened by the challenging experiences of her grandson Harry and his wife.
""The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. Whilst some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately,"" Buckingham Palace said in a March 9 statement.
Earlier, former U.S. first lady Michelle Obama said Meghan's recollections about a remark made about the possible colour of her son's skin were heartbreaking and she hoped Meghan's experiences would be a lesson for the world.
Obama told NBC News: ""I feel like that was heartbreaking to hear, that she felt like she was in her own family - her own family thought differently of her.""
""As I said before, race isn't a new construct in this world for people of colour, and so it wasn't a complete surprise to hear her feelings and to have them articulated,"" she said.

""I think the thing that I hope for, and the thing I think about, is that this, first and foremost, is a family. I pray for forgiveness and healing for them so that they can use this as a teachable moment for us all.""

Operated by France's EDF (PA:EDF), the two reactors at Hinkley Point B power station in Somerset, southwest England, will each be allowed to operate for two periods of approximately six months each, the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said.
The reactors were halted in February and June 2020 and inspections have found cracks in graphite bricks in the reactors' cores. 
The 480-megawatt (MW) reactors will undergo inspections between each period of operation to ensure the cracking does not compromise safety requirements, the ONR said.
""We are satisfied that the Hinkley Point B Reactors 3 and 4 are safe to operate for the specified periods,"" ONR said.
""We are pleased the regulator has approved the re-start of Hinkley Point B,"" an EDF spokesperson said. 
EDF's latest plans showed reactor 3, known as B-7, will restart on March 25 followed by reactor 4, or B-8, on April 11.
In operation since 1976, both are scheduled for closure in July 2022.

“It is a great betrayal of the Iranian nation if any faction or person delays the end of the sanctions even for one hour,” Hassan Rouhani said in televised remarks.
“The small minority that is obstructing this path needs to stop its destructive act. If it stops … the government can break the sanctions,” Rouhani added without elaborating.
The new U.S. administration of President Joe Biden aims to revive an agreement abandoned by his predecessor Donald Trump, under which Iran accepted curbs to its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions. After Trump quit the pact and reimposed sanctions, Iran took steps that violate the deal's nuclear limits.
So far, Iran and the Biden administration are at loggerheads over which side should move first to revive the agreement, with Tehran demanding Washington first lift sanctions and Washington calling on Tehran first to resume compliance with the deal.
""Today, conditions are better than ever for the lifting of the sanctions,"" Rouhani said on Wednesday. The Americans, he said, are willing to return to the deal. However, he added: ""Words are not enough. We are waiting for action.""
Rouhani's close ally Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said this week that unless progress is made soon on restoring the nuclear deal, diplomacy would be halted for months by Iran's presidential election scheduled for June 18.
On Tuesday France's foreign minister blamed Iranian pre-election politics for hindering the nuclear deal's revival.
The stalled nuclear deal has been a flagship policy for Rouhani, a pragmatist who won landslide victories in the last two presidential elections against hardline opponents by promising to open Iran's economy up to the world.
Rouhani is barred from standing for a third term and the slate of candidates has yet to be finalised.

Iran's hardliners say U.S. sanctions are proof that Rouhani's policy of reaching out to enemies was a failure. A delay in progress on the nuclear issue could hurt the chances of a moderate succeeding Rouhani, although the final decision on any diplomatic initiative would be taken by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rather than the elected president.

487,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 06:15AM ET</span>",Hopes and fears raised in rural West Virginia by push for $15 minimum wage,"By Jason Lange and Makini Brice
(Reuters) - At the Custard Stand restaurant in Webster Springs, West Virginia, Angie Cowger worries Democrats' goal of raising the hourly minimum wage to $15 would be the death knell for her business.
Roughly half her employees make about $9 an hour. Cowger can't imagine raising prices on hot dogs and ice cream by enough to cover $15, so she would expect to lay off workers, perhaps having customers place orders on a screen rather than with a cashier. 
""I don't know our customer base would support that,"" Cowger said of her rural town of about 700 people. ""We're in a town that has only one red light in the whole county."" 
While an effort to raise the national minimum wage from its current $7.25 level without Republican votes was blocked in the Senate this month, congressional Democrats have signaled they plan to try again. 
The stakes are perhaps nowhere better illustrated than in West Virginia. Its 16% poverty rate is among the nation's highest and its low wages - half its workers earn less than $16.31 an hour - mean it could see some of the biggest risks and rewards of such a move. 
West Virginia is also home to Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat who opposes the $15 target and is emerging as a key force in the narrowly divided chamber. 
Manchin, whose support would be crucial to the success of any legislation on the issue, says he would back an $11 minimum wage, still a more than 50% increase from where it has stood since 2009. 
Five Senate Republicans - including West Virginia's other senator, Shelley Moore Capito - have proposed an increase to $10, suggesting compromise of some kind is possible.
In Republican-dominated states, where wages are generally lower than in Democratic-leaning states that are home to America's biggest cities, the biggest concern is retaining jobs, not raising wages. 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said in February that raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 as proposed by Democratic President Joe Biden would reduce the number of jobs nationwide by 1.4 million, and possibly by as much as 2.7 million, as businesses struggle with higher costs. 
That hit would come after the pandemic sent the jobless rate well above 15% in West Virginia, higher than the national average. The state's current 6.5% unemployment rate is just above the national level.
SPLIT ON JOBS 
Some experts said job losses could be sharper in rural areas because it will be harder for businesses in small-town America to raise prices enough to offset dramatic increases in pay.
""It's not surprising that the elected officials in low-wage states are more reticent to support higher minimum wages,"" said Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. 
Nine of the 10 states with the lowest median hourly wage - a group that includes West Virginia - picked Republican Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Biden took nine of the ten states with the highest typical hourly wage. (For a graphic on hourly wages across U.S. states, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/3bP1qcT)
Some experts say there is no evidence linking a higher minimum wage to job cuts, however.
""We do not detect any negative employment effects in our sample, and so I would not expect any in WV,"" said Michael Reich, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley.
Labor activists are putting pressure on Manchin and Capito to go big on a minimum wage hike in West Virginia, where Trump beat Biden by nearly 40 percentage points and where well-paying coal jobs - long the state's trademark industry - have been on the decline for decades.
They point out that the CBO study also projected that bringing the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 would boost the incomes of 17 million people nationally and pull 900,000 people out of poverty.
Last month, the activists hired vans to circle Capito and Manchin's offices in Charleston, the state capital, with mobile billboards demanding $15 an hour. The Poor People's Campaign also organized a rally outside of Manchin's office promoting the rise.
Pam Garrison, a 62-year-old retiree who has held minimum-wage jobs for her entire working life, mostly as a cashier, said low wages were part of what held the economy back.

""If you give us the money, we'll get this economy going,"" she said from Fayette County, a coal mining area. ""We spend our money. We will fix our falling-down houses up.""

488,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 06:15AM ET</span>",Kazakhstan faces medicine shortages after forcing price cuts,"ALMATY (Reuters) - Kazakhstan faces shortages of essential medicines such as aspirin after the Central Asian nation's government tried to pressure drug makers and distributors into cutting prices, industry sources say.
The cabinet attempted to ensure drugs used to treat COVID-19 are sold with minimal mark-up, but producers say the effort has backfired and is also affecting medicines used to treat other ailments.
The former Soviet republic has been regulating drug prices since 2019, imposing limits on logistics and marketing expenses and mark-ups as a proportion of ex-works prices.
In January, the government published a list of what it described as ""anti-COVID"" drugs on which it further tightened margins, resulting in the permitted retail sale price falling by 40% on average.
But the list included a number of medicines unrelated to COVID-19 treatment and the move gave importers and distributors no time to sell off inventory purchased at higher prices, says Arminas Macevicius, CIS director at pharmaceutical company Stada.
""The market usually has 2-3 months worth of inventories, meaning that drugstores and distributors had large stocks which had to be sold at lower prices, incurring losses,"" he said.
The ""anti-COVID"" list was so broad that it included medicines such as eye drops, aspirin and Cardiomagnyl, a popular drug used for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
As a result, Cardiomagnyl has already disappeared from most pharmacies. And while producers have helped distributors offset losses on their purchases, they are not willing to provide further supplies at a loss, said another pharmaceuticals executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Meanwhile, Kazakhstan's healthcare ministry has moved to extend the price cuts to all medicines registered locally by sharply reducing marketing allowances.
Drugmakers have appealed to the government, saying the new regulations are counterproductive, but have so far failed to have them reviewed.

A spokeswoman for the ministry said it was working on the matter and would announce new measures soon.

(Reuters) - White supremacist propaganda in the United States including racist, anti-Semitic and anti-LGBTQ messages nearly doubled last year to a record level, according to the Anti-Defamation League. 
The New York-based advocacy group's data showed 5,125 cases reported in 2020, compared to 2,724 in 2019, even though incidents on college campuses dropped by more than half, possibly due to COVID-19 restrictions.
Critics say white supremacism got a boost from U.S. President Donald Trump's recently-ended presidency though he denied racism and said he was smeared by political opponents.
His successor, President Joe Biden, has ordered an assessment of the risk of domestic terrorism in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, some of whom displayed supremacist symbols.
The ADL said in a report on its website that supremacist propaganda appeared in every U.S. state except Hawaii last year, with the highest levels of activity in Texas, Washington, California, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Virginia and Pennsylvania.
""The barrage of propaganda, which overwhelmingly features veiled white supremacist language with a patriotic slant, is an effort to normalize white supremacists' message and bolster recruitment efforts while targeting minority groups including Jews, Blacks, Muslims, non-white immigrants, and the LGBTQ community,"" it said. 
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last month that white supremacy and neo-Nazi movements were becoming a ""transnational threat"" and had exploited the coronavirus pandemic to boost their support.

U.S. Representative Jackie Speier sent a letter earlier this year to Biden urging him to issue an executive order identifying white supremacy and violent extremism as a threat to national security.

The election is widely seen as a referendum on the government's performance during the crisis.
With a night-time curfew in place due to continuing high infection rates, and a ban on public gatherings during the day, the campaign was conducted mostly through television debates. Rutte's main rivals have criticized a slow vaccine roll out, but struggled to distinguish themselves as they support government policy.
""I've been taking responsibility for the past 10 years"" said Rutte, 54, one of Europe's longest-serving politicians, at a final debate Tuesday night. ""I'm trying to govern, in difficult circumstances.""
Roughly 13 million voters are eligible to pick from dozens of parties contesting spots in the 150-seat parliament. The first exit poll is expected shortly after voting ends at 2000 GMT on Wednesday.
Vulnerable groups and the elderly, who were given expanded mail-in and proxy voting options, were encouraged to vote on the first two days, with the general public following on Wednesday.
A centre-left party that is a junior member of Rutte's coalition has made late gains in opinion polls on the strength of the performance in debates of its leader, Sigrid Kaag, who served as United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon in 2015-2017.
The two most recent polls, conducted after voting began on Monday, showed Rutte's party taking around 25% percent of the vote, with Kaag's D-66 now pulling level with the largest opposition party, the Freedom party of anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders at 12-14%.

""You sound like a broken record,"" Kaag told Wilders in a testy debate exchange on Tuesday night. Wilders later accused Kaag of ""treason"" for having worn a head scarf during a diplomatic visit to Iran.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said about 2.3 million others were displaced by conflict in the same period, indicating the vast majority of internal displacements are now triggered by climate change.
Though the figures cover only a six-month period from September 2020 to February 2021, they highlight an accelerating global trend of climate-related displacement, said Helen Brunt, Asia Pacific Migration and Displacement Coordinator for the IFRC.
""Things are getting worse as climate change aggravates existing factors like poverty, conflict, and political instability,"" Brunt said. ""The compounded impact makes recovery longer and more difficult: people barely have time to recover and they're slammed with another disaster."" 
Some 60% of climate-IDPs (internally displaced persons) in the last six months were in Asia, according to IFRC's report.
McKinsey & Co consulting firm has said that Asia ""stands out as being more exposed to physical climate risks than other parts of the world in the absence of adaptation and mitigation"".
Statistics from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC) show that on average 22.7 million people are displaced every year. The figure includes displacements caused by geophysical phenomenon such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, but the vast majority are displaced by weather-related events.
Globally, 17.2 million people were displaced in 2018 and 24.9 million in 2019. Full-year figures are not yet available for 2020, but IDMC's mid-year report showed there were 9.8 million displacements because of natural disasters in the first half of last year.

More than 1 billion people are expected to face forced migration by 2050 due to conflict and ecological factors, a report by the Institute for Economics and Peace found last year. [https://reut.rs/3cyvw3i]

Taiwan has kept the pandemic well under control thanks to early and effective prevention, but has kept its borders largely shut, and the bubble marks a small return to normality. Taiwan currently has only 29 active cases being treated in hospitals.
Palau, one of only 15 countries to officially recognise the Chinese-claimed island's government, and whose president plans to visit Taiwan, has reported zero cases.
""I'm glad to announce the official launch of the Taiwan-Palau travel bubble,"" Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told reporters, calling the move a demonstration of ""firm friendship"" between the two. 
The travel bubble will start in April, with two flights a week carrying 110 tourists each from Taiwan to Palau. Travellers must present negative coronavirus tests and join tour groups, in which they will be asked to follow social-distancing rules such as only visiting designated sites and hotels.
Taiwan will also take tourists travelling in groups from Palau. 
Wu said Palau President Surangel Whipps would visit Taiwan and meet President Tsai Ing-wen on March 28 in what he calls a ""significant"" trip that will boost the bilateral relationship. Palau is home to fewer than 20,000 people and also has close relations with the United States.
In April, Taiwan reported a coronavirus outbreak among sailors visiting Palau, though the source of the infections was never confirmed.

Palau is a three-and-a-half hour flight from Taiwan and is famed for its clear waters and pristine coral reefs. China Airlines Ltd, Taiwan's largest carrier, will fly the travel bubble route.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese court ruled on Wednesday that not allowing same-sex couples to marry is ""unconstitutional,"" setting a precedent in the only G7 nation not to fully recognise same-sex partnership.
The ruling by a district court, the first in Japan on the legality of same-sex marriages, is a major symbolic victory in a country where the constitution still defines marriage as being based on ""the mutual consent of both sexes"".
While a new law will be needed before same-sex marriages can actually take place -- which could take some time in socially conservative Japan -- LGBT activists celebrated the ruling and said it had the potential to change their lives.
""I'm really happy. Until the ruling was announced, we didn't know this was what we'd get and I'm just overjoyed,"" said 44-year old Gon Matsunaka, director of activist group Marriage for All Japan and representative at Pride House Tokyo.
""Its value is absolutely measureless.""
While Japanese law is relatively liberal by Asian standards, social attitudes have keep the LGBT community largely invisible in the world's third largest economy.
Under the current rules, same-sex couples are not allowed to marry, can't inherit their partner's assets - such as the house they may have shared - and also have no parental rights over their partners' children.
Though partnership certificates issued by individual municipalities help same-sex couples to rent a place together and have hospital visitation rights, they still don't give them the same full legal rights enjoyed by heterosexual couples.
The Sapporo District Court threw out the demand for damages by the six plaintiffs - two couples of men and one of women - who had asked that the Japanese government pay 1 million yen ($9,168.42) each in acknowledgment of the pain they suffered by not being able to legally marry.
But the ""unconstitutional"" ruling was the victory the plaintiffs, their lawyers and activists had been hoping for as a key step forward and one that sets an important precedent.
Similar cases are currently being heard in four other courts around Japan and this ruling may indirectly influence the outcome of those by changing public opinion, Matsunaka added.
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
While homosexual sex has been legal in Japan since 1880, social stigma means many have yet to come out even to their families. 
Some in the business world say Japanese rules not allowing same-sex marriage hurts the country's competitive advantage, by making it difficult for companies, especially foreign companies, to attract and keep highly-skilled labour in an increasingly international economy.
A number of companies have taken their own steps to work around the situation, including both international companies and Japanese firms such as Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY). But there are limits.
""For things that are part of the national system, such as pensions, there's nothing they can do,"" said Masa Yanagisawa, head of Prime Services at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Japan and a board member of Marriage for All Japan. 

""All the other advanced countries have this, so Japan will lose out competitively. Then there's the fact that people can't be who they are. It becomes quite business critical.""

A 15-page American intelligence report, released on Tuesday, added heft to longstanding allegations that some of Trump's top lieutenants were playing into Moscow's hands by amplifying claims made against then-candidate Joe Biden by Russian-linked Ukrainian figures in the run-up to the Nov. 3 election.
""The document prepared by the U.S. intelligence community is another set of baseless accusations against our country for interfering in American domestic political processes,"" Russia's embassy in the United States said in a statement on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""The conclusions of the report on Russia conducting influence operations in America are confirmed solely by the confidence of the intelligence services of their self-righteousness. No facts or specific evidence of such claims were provided.""
Washington is expected to impose sanctions on Moscow as soon as next week because of the allegations, three sources said on Tuesday on condition of anonymity. Those sanctions could also address the cyber hack blamed on Russia that used U.S. company SolarWinds Corp to penetrate U.S. government networks.
Russia has denied any involvement in that hack.
The United States imposed sanctions on four senior Russian officials earlier this month over Moscow's treatment of opposition politician Alexei Navalny, something Moscow cast as unacceptable meddling in its domestic affairs.
Russia's U.S. embassy in Washington on Wednesday accused the United States of seeking to besmirch Russia's image and of blaming others for its own problems. 
""We state that Washington continues to practice 'megaphone diplomacy, with the main goal to maintain a negative image of Russia. To blame external players for destabilising the situation inside the country,"" the embassy said in the same statement. 

""This attitude of the administration hardly corresponds to our proposed equal and mutually respectful expert dialogue in search of solutions to the most pressing issues. Washington's actions do not lead to the normalisation of bilateral relations.""

DHAKA (Reuters) - A United Nations delegation will on Wednesday start a three-day visit to a remote Bay of Bengal island where Bangladesh has moved more than 13,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees since December despite criticism from rights groups.
Bangladesh wants to eventually transfer 100,000 of the more than 1 million refugees living in overcrowded border camps to Bhasan Char island, which emerged from the sea only two decade ago and is considered vulnerable to floods.
""This initial three-day visit will bring together experts from U.N. agencies engaged in the Rohingya refugee response in Bangladesh,"" the U.N. refugee agency told Reuters in an email.
""The visit will look at the current situation and facilities on Bhasan Char, appraise the needs of the Rohingya refugees relocated there, as well as discuss with the authorities and others currently working on Bhasan Char.""
The United Nations earlier said it had not been allowed to conduct a technical and safety assessment of the island and was not involved in the transfer of refugees there.
Bangladesh says the relocation is voluntary, but some of a first group to be moved spoke of being coerced. 
The Rohingya, a minority group who fled violence in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, are not allowed to move off the island, which is several hours' journey away from the southern port. 
Bangladesh has dismissed safety concerns over the island, citing the building of flood defences as well as housing for 100,000 people, hospitals and cyclone centres.
It also says overcrowding in refugee camps fuels crime, while some Rohingya said frequent violence in the camps had driven them to relocate.

""We hope it will remove any concerns that the U.N. has about the relocation and they will get involve in the relocation and provide Rohingya people the support they need,"" a senior official at the Foreign Ministry said.

(Reuters) - Eight people, six of them women of Asian descent, were shot dead in a string of attacks on Atlanta-area day spas on Tuesday, and a man suspected of carrying out all of the shootings was arrested hours later in southern Georgia, police said.
Although authorities declined to offer a possible motive for the violence, the attacks prompted the New York Police Department's counter-terrorism unit to announce the deployment of additional patrols in Asian communities there as a precaution.
The bloodshed in Georgia began about 5 p.m. local time when four people were killed and another was wounded in a shooting at Young's Asian Massage in Cherokee County, about 40 miles north of Atlanta, said Captain Jay Baker of the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department.
Two women of Asian descent were among the dead there, along with a white woman and a white man, Baker said, adding that the surviving victim was a Hispanic man.
In Atlanta, the state capital, police officers responding to a call of a ""robbery in progress"" shortly before 6 p.m. arrived at the Gold Spa beauty salon and found three women shot to death, Police Chief Rodney Bryant told reporters.
While investigating the initial shooting report, the officers were called to a separate aroma-therapy spa across the street where a fourth woman was found dead of a gunshot wound, Bryant said. All four victims slain in Atlanta were of Asian descent.
Robert Aaron Long, 21, of Woodstock in Cherokee County, was taken into custody at about 8:30 p.m. in Crisp County, about 150 miles (240 km) south of Atlanta. A photo of Long, who is white, was released by authorities.
Baker told Reuters by telephone that investigators were ""very confident"" that the same suspect was the gunman in all three shootings. A separate statement from the Atlanta Police Department said the suspect was connected to all the attacks by video evidence from the crime scenes.
Investigators were still working ""to confirm with certainty"" that the shootings in Atlanta and Cherokee County were related.
Long was spotted in southern Georgia, far from the crime scenes, after police in Cherokee County issued a bulletin providing a description and license plates of the vehicle involved in the attacks, Baker said.
He was arrested without incident after a highway pursuit by Georgia state police and Crisp County Sheriff's deputies, who used a tactical driving maneuver to stop the suspect's vehicle, sheriff's officials said later.
Authorities said that a motive for the rampage was not immediately clear, and that it was not determined whether the victims were targeted because of their race or ethnicity.
But the NYPD's counter-terrorism branch said on Twitter late Tuesday that although there was no known connection to New York City, the department ""will be deploying assets to our great Asian communities across the city out of an abundance of caution.""
The violence in Georgia unfolded days after U.S. President Joe Biden used a nationally televised speech to condemn a recent surge in hate crimes and discrimination against Asian-Americans. Civil rights groups have suggested that former President Donald Trump contributed to the trend by repeatedly referring to the coronavirus as the “China virus” because it first emerged there. 
A spokesman for the Atlanta field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation said the agency was assisting police in Cherokee County and Atlanta.

Atlanta police said they were stepping up patrols around businesses similar to those attacked on Tuesday evening.

Facing a federal election in September without Merkel, who is standing aside after four terms, the Christian Democrats (CDU) and Bavarian CSU sister party dropped 4 percentage points in a week to 29%, the Forsa poll showed. 
That is the lowest level since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in Germany in March 2020 and follows historic defeats in two regional votes on Sunday.
The Greens were the biggest winner, up 3 points at 21%, while the other main parties stayed unchanged. The Social Democrats, junior partner in Merkel's right-left coalition, were on 16%. 
Many Germans are angry about a sluggish vaccine rollout which was this week dealt a further blow by a decision to suspend AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) doses over safety fears.
Infections are rising just as some lockdown restrictions have been eased and in addition to the vaccine problems, comprehensive testing systems are not yet in place.
Firms in Europe's biggest economy have complained about delays in aid payments and a face mask procurement scandal within the conservative bloc has tainted its reputation further.
Deputy leader of the pro-business Free Democrats Wolfgang Kubicki said Merkel needed to sack ministers.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's newly-appointed defence minister said on Wednesday it has strengthened deployments in the disputed South China Sea and that the United States has approved the export of sensitive technology to equip Taiwan's new submarine fleet.
China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, has increased its military activity near the island in recent months seeking to pressure Taipei to accept Beijing's sovereignty. Taiwan has vowed to defend itself.
Speaking in parliament, Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng, who took up his post last month, said Taiwan has increased personnel and armaments on Itu Aba, the main island Taiwan occupies in the South China Sea.
Itu Aba, also known as Taiping island, is the largest naturally occurring island in the Spratleys and is garrisoned by Taiwan's Coast Guard.
""They are capable of starting a war,"" Chiu told the parliament when asked by a lawmaker on whether China could attack Taiwan. ""My goal is for us to be ready at all times."" 
Chiu said Taiwan was bolstering its position there due to China's ""expansionism"" in the region, though it was not currently considering a return to a permanent army garrison.
China has built man-made islands in the South China Sea and air bases on some of them. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims in the strategic waterway.
Separately, Chiu said that the United States had approved export permits for all of the sensitive equipment needed by Taiwan's indigenous submarine fleet, which it started building last year.
He added that Taiwan's arms purchases from the United States - the island's main source of weapons - had not been impacted by the new Biden administration taking office in Washington and were continuing.
Taiwan is modernising its armed forces, especially as it face almost daily challenges from China in the airspace and waters near the island, including frequent Chinese air force missions into Taiwan's air defence identification zone.
Chiu said these missions were part of China's war of attrition against Taiwan, whose forces are dwarfed by Beijing's, and defence forces were already adjusting on how to deal with such incursions, though did not give details.

""If we match them one for one, it costs a lot,"" he said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy goes on trial on Wednesday accused of financing his failed 2012 re-election campaign illegally, less than three weeks after being convicted of corruption and influence-peddling.
Prosecutors allege that Sarkozy's party, then known as the UMP, splurged nearly double the 22.5 million euros ($27 million) permitted under electoral law on extravagant campaign rallies, and then used a friendly public relations agency to hide the cost.
In their indictment, the prosecutors acknowledge that their investigation had failed to prove Sarkozy either organised or was involved in the scheme, but argue that he benefited from it and must have been aware of it.
""The election candidate and his inner circle opted to focus the campaign on spectacular and expensive rallies and to entrust the organisation to specialist agencies,"" the indictment reads.
Sarkozy, 66, has consistently denied wrongdoing and said he was not aware of a fake billing process. If found guilty, he could be jailed for up to a year and fined up to 3,750 euros.
The trial casts another ignominious pall over a political career that saw Sarkozy bestride the national and global stage for five years, but dramatically fall from grace in a courtroom this month.
Jerome Lavrilleux, Sarkozy's deputy campaign chief in 2012 and one of 13 co-accused, has publicly acknowledged that he oversaw the rerouting of funds paid to the PR agency Bygmalion to camouflage the cost of the campaign events. He has said he acted on his own initiative.
Two co-founders of Bygmalion are also among the accused. One of them, Guy Alves, has publicly acknowledged the fake billing. In 2014, a lawyer for Bygmalion said the company had acted under political pressure. 
Lavrilleux has requested the trial be postponed after a member of his defence team fell sick with COVID-19, and the judges will have to decide on Wednesday whether to adjourn for several weeks. 
Sarkozy was sentenced on March 1 to three years in prison, with two of them suspended, for attempting to bribe a judge to give him inside information on another investigation, into his 2007 campaign finances. He has lodged an appeal.

503,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 08:10PM ET</span>",Britain's Prince Charles takes swipe at anti-vaxxers,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Charles on Wednesday criticised those lobbying against coronavirus vaccines, saying they can ""protect and liberate"" some of society's most vulnerable members. 
In a wide-ranging article for the Future Healthcare Journal in which he called for an integrated approach to healthcare, the heir to the throne also took a swipe at those speaking out against COVID-19 shots.
""Who would have thought ... that in the 21st century that there would be a significant lobby opposing vaccination, given its track record in eradicating so many terrible diseases and its current potential to protect and liberate some of the most vulnerable in our society from coronavirus?"" he wrote. 
The prince, 72, who tested positive for the coronavirus himself in March last year, and other senior members of the royal family have been vociferous in their support of the shots. 
Last month, he and his wife Camilla, 73, had their first COVID-19 doses, while Queen Elizabeth, 94, has also encouraged people to get a shot saying it did not hurt and those who were wary about it should think of others.
However, the focus of the prince's article, published on Wednesday, was his message that long-term health issues needed to be addressed by integrating science, public policy and personal behaviour.
""I also believe that medicine will need to combine bioscience with personal beliefs, hopes, aspirations and choices,"" Charles wrote, calling for an open-minded approach to complementary medicine whose virtues he has long espoused despite criticism from some in the medical profession.
In 2011, a leading professor of complementary medicine accused the prince of ""quackery"", saying that he and other backers of alternative therapies were ""snake-oil salesmen"" who promoted products with no scientific basis.
Charles said he had always advocated ""the best of both worlds"" to bring evidence-informed conventional and complementary medicine together and seek a middle ground over the issue.

""Only then can we escape divisions and intolerance on both sides of the conventional/complementary equation, where on the one hand, the appropriate regulation of the proven therapies of acupuncture and medical herbalism is opposed, while on the other we find people actually opposing life-saving vaccinations,"" he wrote.

Washington believed it was going into talks with top Chinese officials with an increasingly strong hand, and would lay out its concerns about China's behavior regarding Hong Kong, human rights violations in Xinjiang province, and Beijing's continuing ""malicious"" cyber activity, the official told a telephone briefing.
A second official said the United States did not expect any specific ""deliverables"" or outcomes from the meeting scheduled for March 18 in Alaska, and no joint statement was expected.

Britain this week announced an overhaul of its foreign and defence policy to prioritise influence in the Indo-Pacific as a way to help moderate the expanding power and assertiveness of China's Communist Party leadership.
Speaking to the U.S. Aspen Security Forum to project that new agenda beyond a domestic audience, Raab will sum up the foreign policy review as a mission to be a ""force for good in the world"", saying that global democratic institutions are under their greatest threat since the end of the Cold War in 1989-90.
""Democracy is in retreat,"" he will say, adding that data showed that this decade the combined economic output of autocratic regimes is expected to exceed the combined output of the world’s democracies.
""Tyranny is richer than freedom, and that matters to us here at home because stable, freedom-respecting democracies are much less likely to go to war, house terrorists or trigger large scale flows of migrants,"" Raab said.
""They are generally, not always, but generally easier to trade with, and easier to cooperate with to solve our shared problems.""
Since its 2016 vote to leave the European Union, Britain have been searching for a new role on the global stage which lives up to the promise made by Brexit campaigners - namely that, outside the EU, British influence would be projected around the world and bring greater economic prosperity.
Raab's speech will try to show that Britain, although dwarfed economically and militarily by China and the United States, now has a strategy to meet those expectations. 
Central to that plan is finding a leading role in protecting democracies and building a new international system based on democratic values.

""Without power, without economic, military, diplomatic, cultural clout, we can do nothing,"" Raab will say.

Islamist militants, who seized Mali's desert north in 2012 before being pushed back by French-led forces the following year, have stepped up attacks in the north and centre in recent years. Many are linked to al Qaeda or Islamic State. 
Last year was Mali's deadliest on record due to attacks by the militants, tit-for-tat violence between rival ethnic groups and killings by security forces, according to data compiled by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED). 
The militants have also used Mali as a base to extend their operations into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger, defying attempts by regional, French and U.N. troops to contain them.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hundreds of people protested outside Parliament and London's police headquarters for a third consecutive night on Tuesday, angered by the killing of Sarah Everard and government plans to tighten the law on demonstrations.
The London police officer charged with Everard's kidnap and murder, 48-year-old Wayne Couzens, appeared in court for a second time on Tuesday and his lawyer did not apply for bail pending a full trial in October.
Police have also faced heavy criticism from across the political spectrum for their response to a vigil on Saturday to mourn 33-year-old Everard's death, which police chief Cressida Dick said broke COVID social distancing laws.
London mayor Sadiq Khan said he had ""expressed his unhappiness"" to Dick about Saturday's policing, when four women were arrested in connection with public order offences or breaches of COVID rules. Interior minister Priti Patel said scenes appeared ""upsetting"".
Police have taken a more hands-off approach to subsequent protests outside parliament and their own headquarters at New Scotland Yard.
More than 600 protesters near parliament chanted: ""Sack Cressida Dick. Sack Priti Patel."" 
Those near the police headquarters shouted, ""all cops are bastards"" and rattled metal barriers that had been set up.
As Tuesday's protest outside Parliament took place, lawmakers passed part of a criminal justice bill spearheaded by Patel, which will make it easier for police to ban protests that might cause major disruptions. 
Some of those present said Everard's killing had weakened their faith in the police but also wanted to keep the focus on the broader concerns many women have for their personal safety.
The government has proposed sending plain-clothes police officers into bars and nightclubs to look for signs of sexual harassment, drawing a mixed reaction from women.

""People won't feel comfortable necessarily with plainclothes police officers,"" 18-year-old student Lola Thompson told Reuters. ""What is more important is ... everyone being aware of what they can do to make women feel safer.""

Officials with the World Health Organization's Americas branch PAHO said COVAX had donated 135,000 doses and that Nicaragua would receive more shots through the COVAX mechanism at the end of March, but did not specify how many.
Nicaraguan Vice President Rosario Murillo said earlier on Tuesday the COVAX program had provided 137,000 doses.
In late February, Nicaragua received its first batch of vaccine doses from an initial donation of Russia's Sputnik V product and has begun inoculating people with pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, kidney failure and cancer.
India has also already donated 200,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Nicaragua, and has agreed to deliver an additional 300,000 doses.
Global health experts are seeking to clear up questions about the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine as around a dozen European countries have suspended its use over a possible heightened risk of blood clots. 
Europe's medicines regulator is investigating and is expected to release its findings on Thursday.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has started enriching uranium at its underground Natanz plant with a second type of advanced centrifuge, the IR-4, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said in a report reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday, in a further breach of Tehran's deal with major powers.
Iran has recently accelerated its breaches of the deal's restrictions on its nuclear activities in an apparent bid to pressure U.S. President Joe Biden as both sides are locked in a standoff over who should move first to save the deal.
Tehran's breaches began in 2019 in response to the U.S. withdrawal from the deal and the reimposition of U.S. economic sanctions against Iran under Biden's predecessor Donald Trump, who opposed the agreement and sought to wreck it.
Last year Iran started moving three cascades, or clusters, of different advanced models of centrifuge from an above-ground plant at Natanz to its below-ground Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP). It is already enriching underground with IR-2m centrifuges. The deal only lets it enrich there with first-generation IR-1 machines.
""On 15 March 2021, the Agency verified that Iran began feeding the cascade of 174 IR-4 centrifuges already installed at FEP with natural UF6,"" the International Atomic Energy Agency said in the report to member states dated Monday, referring to uranium hexafluoride, the form in which uranium is fed into centrifuges for enrichment.
Iran has indicated that it now plans to install a second cascade of IR-4 centrifuges at the FEP but installation of that cascade has yet to begin, the report said. Iran has already increased the number of IR-2m machines, which are far more efficient than the IR-1, installed at the underground plant.
""In summary, as of 15 March 2021, Iran was using 5,060 IR-1 centrifuges installed in 30 cascades, 522 IR-2m centrifuges installed in three cascades and 174 IR-4 centrifuges installed in one cascade, to enrich natural UF6 up to 5% U-235 at FEP,"" the IAEA report said, referring to the fissile purity of uranium.

Iran is enriching up to 20% purity at another plant, Fordow.

Left-wing economist Andres Arauz and conservative banker Guillermo Lasso are seeking to win over voters who supported more than a dozen candidates with varying political views in the first round of voting on Feb. 7. 
Although Arauz beat Lasso in the first round by more than 10 percentage points, no polls have yet been released showing how they would fare in April, and many of the country's voters are still undecided.
Ecuadoreans are weary from austerity measures linked to an International Monetary Fund package that added pain to an already difficult situation created by the outbreak of the coronavirus last year.
The current president, Lenin Moreno, who defeated Lasso in a 2017 runoff, is not seeking another term.
Arauz, a protégé of former President Rafael Correa, has promised to give $1,000 each to a million poor families, and is now offering to provide benefits to young people including jobs, scholarships and free internet access.
""The final stretch begins today,"" Arauz tweeted. ""I am prepared to transform the outrage of our people into hope.""
Lasso, a three-time presidential candidate, has offered to hold talks with indigenous leader Yaku Perez, who narrowly finished third to him in the first round.
Perez, who alleged fraud in the first round and is still seeking a recount, has said he will not support any candidate in the runoff. Indigenous organization CONAIE is calling on voters to spoil their ballots in protest.
Official results from the first round showed Arauz won 32.7% of the vote, while Lasso received 19.74% and Perez had 19.39%. Some 10% of votes cast were declared invalid.
Lasso has adjusted his conservative discourse to include promises of greater equity for women in the workplace, defense of animal rights and ending discrimination over sexual orientation.
But he still faces resistance because of his banking background.

""We are facing a historic opportunity to change for the better and create a country,"" Lasso told a virtual event in Quito.

The attacks on Monday occurred in the Tillabery region, which is near the border with Mali and Burkina Faso and has seen increasingly deadly attacks by Islamist militants active across the region with links to Islamic State and al Qaeda. 
Suspected militants killed at least 100 civilians on Jan. 2 in raids on two villages in Tillabery, one of the deadliest episodes in the country’s recent history.
The assailants this time intercepted four vehicles transporting passengers from a weekly market to the villages of Chinagoder and Darey Dey, the government said in a statement on Tuesday.

Niger and its neighbours have also experienced tit-for-tat killings between rival ethnic communities, stoked by the militant violence and competition for scarce resources.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The war in Yemen is ""back in full force,"" the United Nations mediator told the Security Council on Tuesday amid renewed attempts to get the warring parties to talk and U.N. warnings that the country is spiralling toward a massive famine. 
Martin Griffiths told the council that there had been a dramatic deterioration in the more than six-year-long war with a Houthi offensive on Marib - the Yemeni government's last northern stronghold - putting millions of civilians at risk.
""We are also seeing other fronts in Yemen opening, including with military escalations in Hajjah and Taiz and Hudaydah. The war is back in full force,"" he told the 15-member council. 
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 after the Iran-aligned Houthi group ousted the country's government from the capital Sanaa. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.
U.S. President Joe Biden has made ending the war in Yemen a priority. His special envoy Tim Lenderking said on Friday that a ""sound plan"" for a ceasefire in Yemen had been before the Houthi leadership for ""a number of days"".
""The death and violence must stop. We call on the Houthis to accept an immediate, comprehensive, nationwide ceasefire and to cease all attacks. In the meantime, we will continue to hold Houthi leadership to account,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the council.
The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Some 80% of Yemenis need help, with 400,000 children under the age of 5 severely malnourished, according to U.N. data. For much of its food, the country relies on imports that have been disrupted over the years by all warring parties.

""A nationwide ceasefire, along with the opening of Sanaa airport and ensuring the unhindered flow of fuel and other commodities into Yemen through Hodeidah ports, are urgent humanitarian imperatives,"" Griffiths said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The nominee for Brazil's health minister, who will represent the ministry's third change of leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic, said on Tuesday that he plans to continue the controversial policies of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro.
The initial comments by cardiologist Marcelo Queiroga, a day after he was tapped by Bolsonaro, dashed hopes for a change in course to curb a worsening pandemic that has killed over 270,000 people in Brazil, which had the worst weekly death toll in the world last week.
Outgoing Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello, an active duty army general, was under pressure as fatalities surged, even though he toed Bolsonaro's line against lockdowns. He also backed the president's endorsement of anti-malarial drugs to treat COVID-19, the effectiveness of which is disputed by many health care providers.
""Minister Pazuello has been working hard to improve health conditions in Brazil and I was called upon by President Bolsonaro to continue this work,"" Queiroga told reporters as he arrived for his first meeting at the ministry.
He said health policy is set by the president and the minister is there to implement it.
The formal appointment of Queiroga, who campaigned for Bolsonaro in 2018 and served on his transition team, is expected on Wednesday. There is no date yet for a handover, although he has begun transition work by meeting with Pazuello.
Queiroga, who is president of the Brazilian Cardiology Society, criticized the use of anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients in a newspaper interview on Sunday, saying there was no scientific evidence that it worked, but he added that doctors are free to prescribe the drug.
He also said that lockdowns are not the way to stop the pandemic, repeating Bolsonaro's position in defiance of most public health experts and state governors in Brazil.
Pazuello, who has no medical degree, had been criticized for lacking public health expertise and rubberstamping Bolsonaro's decisions. His two predecessors resigned in roughly the span of a month last year, in part because as physicians they would not fully endorse treating patients with hydroxychloroquine. 
Pazuello expanded access to the drug, which is unproven as a COVID-19 treatment, and allowed it to be prescribed to virtually anyone testing positive for the novel coronavirus.

His failure to secure timely supplies of vaccines led to calls for an inquiry in Congress, while the Supreme Court is investigating his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the northern city of Manaus, where hospitals ran out of oxygen.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea might begin flight testing an improved design for its inter-continental ballistic missiles ""in the near future,"" the head of the U.S. military's Northern Command said on Tuesday, a move that would sharply increase tensions between Pyongyang and Washington.
The warning by Air Force General Glen VanHerck appeared based on North Korea's October unveiling at a parade of what would be its largest ICBM yet, and not specific intelligence about an imminent launch. 
Still, VanHerck made his remarks a day ahead of a debut trip by President Joe Biden's top diplomat and defense secretary to South Korea and underscores U.S. concerns that Pyongyang may resume testing of missiles and nuclear weapons after a hiatus of more than three years.
Even during the testing lull, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for continued production of nuclear weapons for his arsenal, launched a series of smaller missiles and unveiled the ICBM.
VanHerck told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Pyongyang's ""considerably larger and presumably more capable"" ICBM further increased the threat to the United States. Still, he expressed confidence in U.S. missile defenses.
The U.S. general also noted that Kim released himself from a moratorium on testing over a year ago. 
""The North Korean regime has also indicated that it is no longer bound by the unilateral nuclear and ICBM testing moratorium announced in 2018, suggesting that Kim Jong Un may begin flight testing an improved ICBM design in the near future,"" VanHerck said in his written testimony.
Jenny Town, director of 38 North, a U.S.-based website that tracks North Korea, said that while an ICBM test was possible ""I’m not sure how likely it is.""
She speculated that instead North Korea would be more likely to restart test launches with shorter-range missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.
""It seems more likely that if North Korea is going to start testing missiles again, it will start with ones where testing has been almost normalized,"" Town said.
A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that while there have been indications in recent weeks that North Korea may be preparing for a missile launch, one did not appear imminent.
The White House on Monday confirmed a Reuters report that the Biden administration sought to reach out to North Korea but had received no response, extending a chill in relations that began at the end of Donald Trump's administration.
After the White House remarks, North Korean state news reported that the sister of the North Korean leader https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2B72QW, Kim Yo Jong, criticized the Biden Administration for ongoing military drills in South Korea.
""If it wants to sleep in peace for coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step,"" Kim said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA.

The joint U.S.-South Korean springtime military drill begun last week was limited to computer simulations because of the coronavirus risk, as well as the efforts to engage with the North.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian state refiners are planning to cut oil imports from Saudi Arabia by about a quarter in May, in an escalating stand-off with Riyadh following OPEC's decision to ignore calls from New Delhi to help the global economy with higher supply.
Two sources familiar with the discussions said the move was part of the government's drive to cut dependence on crude from the Middle East.
Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp., Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd are preparing to lift about 10.8 million barrels in May, the sources said on condition of anonymity. 
State refiners, which control about 60% of India's 5 million barrels per day (bpd) refining capacity, together import an average 14.7-14.8 million barrels of Saudi oil in a month, the sources said. 
India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, imports more than 80% of its oil needs and relies heavily on the Middle East.
Hit hard by rising oil prices, India's oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan has repeatedly called on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, known as OPEC+, to ease supply curbs.
He has blamed Saudi's voluntary cuts for contributing to a spike in global oil prices.
OPEC+ decided this month to extend most cuts into April. Responding to Pradhan's request, Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman suggested India dip into strategic reserves filled with cheaper oil bought last year. 
India's oil ministry responded by asking refiners to speed up their diversification of crude sources and reduce reliance on the Middle East.
Indian refiners could not cut April oil imports from Saudi Arabia as nominations were placed before the OPEC+ decision in early March, the sources said, adding that plans for May were preliminary and final May nominations would be known in early April.
Saudi Arabia has cut April oil supplies for some Asian refiners but has maintained average monthly volumes for Indian refiners. The Kingdom has, however, rejected demand from Indian companies for extra supplies.
The Middle East's share of India's overall imports has already plunged to a 22-month low in February. 
In February, the United States emerged as the second biggest supplier to India after Iraq, while Saudi Arabia, which has consistently been one of India's top two suppliers, slipped to No. 4 for the first time since at least January 2006.
Two Indian refiners -IOC and MRPL - have also issued tenders seeking oil for delivery in May. [CRU/TENDA]

""The Oil companies take their own decision regarding purchase of crude,"" the oil ministry told Reuters. The state refiners did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece and Turkey held more exploratory talks in Athens on Tuesday, agreeing to talk again after more than 60 rounds as they seek common ground on a long-standing maritime boundaries dispute before a European Union summit this month.
The NATO allies are at odds over issues such as competing claims over their respective continental shelves, maritime rights and air space in the Mediterranean, energy, ethnically split Cyprus, and the status of some islands in the Aegean. 
Turkey this week protested against a deal between Greece, Israel and Cyprus for an undersea cable linking their electricity grids. According to the state-run Anadolu news agency, Ankara says the planned route for the cable runs through Turkey's continental shelf.
The exploratory talks are meant to lay the ground for formal negotiations but the two countries have made little progress in more than 60 rounds of meetings since 2002 and cannot even agree on what issues to discuss.
The talks concluded after nearly four hours and the two sides agreed to hold another round in Istanbul, according to diplomatic sources cited by Greek state TV ERT. No details were given on the substance of the meeting.
A separate meeting between Greek and Turkish officials outside the exploratory framework will take place on Wednesday. 
Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias said earlier he was willing to meet his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu but any meeting ""must take place in the right atmosphere"". 
Ending a five-year hiatus, officials met in January after months of tension in the eastern Mediterranean. 
Athens has said it will discuss only the demarcation of exclusive economic zones and the continental shelf in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean, not issues of ""national sovereignty"". 
Ankara, which hopes to improve its relations with the European Union, which has supported EU-member Greece and threatened sanctions on Turkey, has said it wants all issues, including air space and the Aegean islands, on the table. 
European leaders are expected to discuss the eastern Mediterranean at a meeting on March 25-26. 
Greece, which in recent years has reached maritime accords with Italy and Egypt, say if the two sides fail to agree, they should refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice.

    Within days he had developed livid blotches on his skin, a high fever, vomiting and dark urine. 
    Doctors at the city's hospital, overrun with severe COVID cases, repeatedly tested him for COVID but with the results coming back negative were at a loss as to what was wrong with him. 
    By the time his illness was identified as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, it was too late. Lorena could not be at her son's bedside because of strict health protocols, but a social worker called to pass on the message that her son loved her very much. She asked the social worker to tell her son she would see him soon, and that his pets were well. 
""A doctor said that if I had faith, I should pray because my son was very ill,"" said Navarrete, who works as a nurse technician. ""They had a diagnosis and it was PIMS.""
    Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), as PIMS is more commonly known, is a rare, life-threatening syndrome linked to COVID-19.
    It usually appears between two and six weeks after infection, even in asymptomatic cases of COVID-19.
    It shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease, including fever, rashes, swollen glands, conjunctivitis and, in severe cases, heart inflammation, and can cause multiple organ failure. It is not always fatal if caught and treated early.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in January that it was investigating whether COVID variants were increasing the number or severity of cases following anecdotal reports from some states.
Dr. Loreto Twele, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Puerto Montt hospital, said catching it was like piecing together a jigsaw. 
    ""There is no single exam. You have to put the pieces together to be able to make an early diagnosis and start treatment,"" she said. 
Chilean public health chief Paula Daza said in a media briefing on Monday that of the 69,563 confirmed cases of COVID in children so far in Chile, 157 cases of MIS-C have been reported. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi)
    ""The rate of cases of children with these conditions is quite low, however, health professionals have to be alert,"" she said.
   For Emilio's mother Lorena, the pain of losing her only son is partly helped by knowing she can raise awareness. 
    ""I do not want Emilio's death to be in vain and for this to be known so that the same thing does not happen to other parents,"" she said.

Bolsonaro, who has faced widespread criticism over his handling of the world's second deadliest coronavirus outbreak, originally chose Jorge Luiz Kormann to be on the board of Anvisa, which oversees approvals of vaccines for use against COVID-19. 
Kormann was previously in the military-led health ministry, and his transfer to an important technocratic role at Anvisa drew widespread concern and raised doubts about whether he would be confirmed in the post by the Senate.
However, Bolsonaro has now withdrawn Kormann's name and proposed Romison Rodrigues Mota for the role, according to a post in the official gazette on Tuesday. Mota is a career civil servant who is already serving as acting Anvisa director. 
The removal of Kormann appears to be part of a broader shift in Bolsonaro's attitude toward a pandemic he has long sought to portray as a ""little flu."" Faced with growing discontent over a record run of deaths and a slow vaccine rollout, there are signs Bolsonaro is starting to see his skeptical stance as a major threat to his hopes of re-election in 2022.
After months of decrying protective masks, he recently appeared masked, and local media have reported he is planning to get vaccinated, despite saying he would not take any shot.

Publicly, Kormann has shared Bolsonaro's interest in the unproven drug chloroquine and its cousin hydroxychloroquine for use against COVID-19.

525,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 02:06PM ET</span>","Deadly Yemen migrant centre fire caused by Houthi projectiles, HRW says","ADEN (Reuters) - A fire last week that killed more than 40 African migrants in an overcrowded detention centre in Yemen's capital Sanaa was started after Houthi forces fired projectiles during a skirmish with detainees, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Tuesday.
The United Nations migration agency IOM says the March 7 fire engulfed a hangar-like building holding around 350 people from among 900 being held at the Immigration, Passport and Naturalization Authority Holding Facility at Sanaa airport.
Reuters spoke to one Ethiopian who described himself as a survivor of the blaze and corroborated the HRW account of a projectile as the cause. It was not possible to provide further independent verification.
IOM declined to comment on the cause of the blaze. The Houthis, who control Yemen's capital Sanaa and run the detention centre, have said the incident is under investigation.
Asked about the HRW account, Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam did not directly address the accusation that the fire was caused by a projectile fired by security forces. He said the international community should help provide better facilities for migrants, and the incident ""should not be politicised or exploited outside of its normal context"".
In its report on the incident based on interviews with five Ethiopian survivors and U.N. officials, HRW said that on the day of the fire, detainees had protested conditions by refusing to eat. A skirmish broke out and Houthi security forces arrived.
""The guards then rounded up the migrants nearby and locked them in the hanger,"" the HRW report said.
A first projectile was launched from a roof, producing smoke. A second exploded loudly and started a fire, said HRW, which said it could not verify the projectile types. People outside the burning hanger helped break the walls and door to evacuate people.
Yemen has been at war for six years, pitting the Iran-aligned Houthis who control the capital and most populous areas against a Saudi-backed government based in the southern port of Aden. Millions of Yemenis live on the edge of famine in what the United Nations calls the world's biggest humanitarian crisis.
SURVIVORS REACH ADEN
Around a dozen migrants who described themselves as survivors of last week's fire in Sanaa protested on Monday outside a U.N. building in Aden. They said that after the fire they had been deported to government-held territory and had been forced to make a three-day journey to Aden.
Ahmed Abdallah, an Ethiopian among the group, described the incident, telling Reuters a projectile had been fired through a hole into the room he was in. 
""The fire caught onto the piles of pillows we are sleeping on. The room filled with smoke and we all started to scream,"" he said. He escaped through a door. 
""They locked the room to others who were still inside,"" he said. ""I was watching through the window while my fellow inmates were burning.""
Despite Yemen's war, migrants from the Horn of Africa still risk dangerous sea crossings in the hands of smugglers to get there, en route to Saudi Arabia or other wealthy Gulf countries. 
In February, IOM estimates 1,255 irregular migrants arrived in Yemen, mostly Ethiopians. The United Nations says migrants have been increasingly stigmatised during the COVID-19 pandemic, after Houthi authorities in May announced their first coronavirus case in a Somali found dead in a Sanaa hotel.
On Friday, footage released by the Houthis showed 44 bodies of those killed in the detention centre blaze, lined up in numbered body bags in a dusty cemetery being buried.

""Number 29!,"" called a burial supervisor as men lowered a body into a grave.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Work could finally begin on renovating the outside of Brussels landmark the Palais de Justice - but only after the scaffolding that has cloaked the courthouse since 1987 gets another full safety check.
The scaffolding has become as much part of the Belgian capital's landscape as the domed building itself and has already been changed twice after it rusted during the delays in the renovations caused by cash shortages and stability concerns.
Once 200 days of inspections on the metal skeleton are complete, then it could be full steam ahead on the long-awaited project.
""We are starting the first phase of the work after 40 years asleep,"" Mathieu Michel, secretary of state for administrative simplification and building management, told Belgian newspaper L'Echo.
The courthouse, designed by architect Joseph Poelaert and built between 1866 and 1883, was at the time the largest building constructed in Europe, larger than St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, according to the institution that manages state buildings, known as Regie des Batiments.
It was partly destroyed in September 1944 when German soldiers set the dome on fire.
The renovation of the outside of the building is due to cost 100 million euros ($120 million) and is due to end in 2030, Michel said.
Another 100 million euros would be needed for renovating the 81,000 square meters inside building, which Belgium hopes to complete by 2040.

France, along with Britain, Germany and the European Union, are working to try to bring the United States and Iran to the table for informal talks that would be a first step to reviving the 2015 deal, which lifted international sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs to its nuclear programme.
Both sides so far appear unwilling to compromise. The Iranian New Year this week and the presidential election campaign in Iran are also likely to complicate matters.
""There is a tactical problem and also an internal (issue) in Iran, which is in a particular situation because we are quite close to the presidential election in June,"" Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a hearing at the French Senate.
He did not say what the tactical problem was but added that, while there was a stated will to return to talks, tensions remained and it was urgent to move forward to calm the situation.
""We are sending signals to the Iranians so that we can have this return (to the nuclear deal), which would be the prelude to a wider discussion beyond the JCPOA (nuclear deal) on regional destabilisation, but also Iran's missile capacities,"" Le Drian said. ""The return to the JCPOA is just the starting point.""

Iran has ruled out broadening nuclear talks to other subjects. Since the United States quit the deal when Donald Trump was president, Iran has progressively reduced its compliance with the pact.

In the lowland city of Santa Cruz, the largest crowds gathered for a rally around a Christ the Redeemer statue waving Bolivian flags and carrying banners calling for a defense of democracy and freedom.
Bolivia's leftist government, which came back into power last November, has sought the arrest of a number of former officials, military and civil leaders it accuses of conspiring to oust long-term leader Evo Morales less than two years ago.
Morales, whose MAS party is now back in power, resigned in late 2019 amid widespread protests against his government and after the military urged him to step down. In a power vacuum, Anez, then a Senator, had taken over as interim President.
The arrests have prompted fears of a political crackdown, with criticism from human rights groups and the Organization for American States (OAS), which said the government was using the judiciary as a ""repressive"" tool.
Anez, a devout Catholic and conservative who led the country for less than a year, was transferred to a La Paz jail on Monday. Others from her government and former military leaders have been arrested too.
""To those prisoners, to those persecuted politicians, we will not abandon you,"" Luis Camacho, a civil leader and governor elect for Santa Cruz, said during the rally in the city. ""We will be firm because this is going to be a strong fight.""
Camacho, a prominent anti-government figure in 2019, also faces potential arrest according to a warrant seen by Reuters.
Bolivia's government, now led by Morales' ally and former economy minister Luis Arce, has repeatedly said the arrests are part of transparent investigations and that it is not persecuting its political opponents.
In the administrative highland capital La Paz, protesters marched through the streets, some with face masks saying ""fraud"" and a picture of Morales, a reference to allegations made by the OAS he rigged the presidential election in 2019.

""We have proven that this Venezuela-style government has no respect for the popular will,"" said protester Olga Flores. ""We do not want another MAS (socialist party) dictator in power.""

Market dealers said the Lebanese pound was trading at around 15,000 to the dollar, having lost a third of its value in the last two week to stand at barely a 10th of what it was worth in late 2019, when Lebanon's economic and financial crisis erupted.
Banks have blocked access to dollar deposits, and poverty is spreading - but fractious politicians have yet to launch a rescue plan that could unlock foreign aid. 
""Let them wake up now. Please have mercy on us, we're begging you!"" said one protester, Hussein Makieh. ""Look at us, we're starving. We're dying. The middle class is gone. There's 3% of the country, the thieves, living off it.""
Parliamentary committees discussed an emergency loan for the state-run electricity company after the energy minister warned that, without more money, the lights would go out across Lebanon by the end of the month. 
The lawmakers only managed to promise $200 million out of a requested $1 billion, and that amount now needs parliament's approval to go through. 
The caretaker prime minister, Hassan Diab, said there were efforts to secure credit as fuel for electricity generation was running out. He also said subsidies on basic goods were covered until June. 
The prospect that those subsidies could be scrapped has sparked fears of rising hunger and warnings of catastrophe from the United Nations. 
An official source who declined to be named told Reuters that $1.0-1.5 billion remained in the pot for subsidies, which cover items including wheat, fuel and medicine. 
The source said foreign reserves now stood at around $16 billion, compared to a central bank estimate of $19.5 billion in August. 
Lebanon's already dire predicament deepened last August when a blast at Beirut's port devastated large parts of the city, killing 200 people and prompting Diab's cabinet to resign. 
But his designated successor, veteran politician Saad al-Hariri, is at loggerheads with President Michel Aoun and has yet to form a new government, which must carry out reforms before it can unlock foreign aid.
""We're absolutely sick of this!"" yelled one protester, standing near a barricade of garbage trucks and bonfires blocking a road in the capital.

""We're hungry - we're finished!""

On a trip to a vaccination centre in north London, Camilla, 73, said she had received the AstraZeneca vaccine and had not been concerned whether she received that or another shot made by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech.
""I don't even ask because I hate injections so much that I shut my eyes ... so whatever comes out,"" said the duchess, who was vaccinated along with her 72-year-old husband last month.
Her comment came after the AstraZeneca vaccine was suspended by 13 countries across the European Union and several national regulators expressed safety worries about blood clots. 
The European Medicines Agency is investigating reports of 30 cases of unusual blood disorders among 5 million recipients, but said it itself did not see a reason to change its recommendation that the AstraZeneca vaccine remained safe.
More than 24 million people in Britain have so far received their first dose, with over 11 million having received the AstraZeneca shot. 

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said on Tuesday there was no evidence that blood clots were any more likely to occur after people had been given the AstraZeneca vaccine, citing the view of Britain's medicine regulator.

The country had previously been reducing its nuclear weapons stockpile, and in 2010, the government set a cap of 180 warheads for the mid-2020 period. Johnson scrapped the earlier limit and said the number would now rise to a maximum of 260. 
In its security and defence review, Britain said it faced risks from nuclear-armed states, emerging nuclear states and state-sponsored nuclear terrorism, and its nuclear deterrent was needed to guarantee its security and that of its allies. 
""Some states are now significantly increasing and diversifying their nuclear arsenals,"" the government said. ""The increase in global competition, challenges to the international order, and proliferation of potentially disruptive technologies all pose a threat to strategic stability."" 
The move was criticised by The Elders, a group of former global policymakers who campaign for peace.
""While the UK cites increased security threats as justification for this move, the appropriate response to these challenges should be to work multilaterally to strengthen international arms control agreements and to reduce - not increase - the number of nuclear weapons in existence,"" said Mary Robinson, chair of the group. 
Questioned over the policy in parliament Johnson said Britain was still committed to global nuclear arms reduction. 
Britain also said it planned to replace its current nuclear warhead with a new one which would be able to operate throughout the lifespan of four new submarines being built and due to enter service in the early 2030s. 
It will work with the United States to ensure the new warhead remains Trident-compatible. 
With its current submarines, Britain said it would stick to its existing policy of always having one submarine of its four nuclear deterrent submarines on continuous patrol.

Speculation in East Africa is rife that Magufuli, 61, a vocal COVID-19 sceptic, is ill with the coronavirus, though his vice president said on Monday that Tanzania was safe and citizens should ignore rumours from outside the country.
""It is important for the government to inform the public about the president’s health to reduce ongoing fear,"" Zitto Kabwe, leader of the ACT-Wazalendo party, said in a statement.
""The president's health is not supposed to be a secret,"" he said.
Kabwe said Tanzania's constitution calls for the speaker of the national assembly to make information public on the president's health. He recalled that Tanzanians received regular updates on the health of two former presidents, Benjamin Mkapa and Jakaya Kikwete, when they were abroad for medical treatment. 
""The public have not been informed about whether the president is performing his duties and whether the vice president has taken up the duties of the president,"" Kabwe later told Reuters by phone.
Government spokesman Hassan Abbasi did not return calls and messages seeking comment. 
Magufuli has mocked global panic over the COVID-19 pandemic and played down the virus' threat in Tanzania. He has denounced COVID-19 tests, denounced vaccines, and opposed mask-wearing, instead urging his people to put faith in prayer and try remedies such as steam inhalation.
Legal and constitutional affairs minister Mwigulu Nchemba said on Monday that anyone ""blathering, spreading misinformation"" were breaking the law and could be arrested.
Another opposition politician, Tundu Lissu, who lost an election last year to Magufuli, said last week from exile in Belgium that the president is in India receiving medical treatment for the virus and is in a serious condition. 
India's immigration service records do not show anybody by the name of John Magufuli entering the country, and air ambulance flight records do not show a flight from East Africa since Feb. 1, an Indian government source told Reuters on Tuesday.

Kabwe, the opposition leader, also called on the government to release people arrested for questioning the president's health. Police have arrested four people in the country since last week for allegedly spreading false information about the sickness of political leaders, according to the police, who did not mention the president's name when referring to the arrests.

Kurz's opponents have accused him of trying to deflect blame away from his government for the relatively slow pace of vaccinations.
The EU has a mechanism for redistributing doses left when others do not take up their full pro rata allocation, and the Commission has said it is up to member states to decide whether they want to go back to a strictly population-based method.
""It has to be possible here to develop a correction mechanism,"" Kurz told a news conference with his Bulgarian, Czech and Slovenian counterparts after a meeting that the leaders of Croatia and Latvia joined by video link.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel are working ""to find a solution"", Kurz added.

535,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 11:46AM ET</span>",Ex-officer on trial for George Floyd's death asks to show jury an earlier arrest,"By Jonathan Allen
(Reuters) - Almost exactly a year before George Floyd was killed in a deadly arrest by Minneapolis police officers in May 2020, he found himself in another encounter with police in which he became distressed as an officer pointed a gun at him.
On Tuesday, a lawyer for Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer on trial for murder charges for Floyd's death, asked the judge to allow the jury to see evidence of the earlier episode.
In the arrest of May 6, 2019, a panicking Floyd swallowed several opioid pain-killer pills as police approached. Eric Nelson, Chauvin's lead lawyer, has argued that the main cause of Floyd's death a year later, which was ruled a homicide, was the opioid fentanyl found in his blood at autopsy.
""The similarities are incredible, it's the exact same behavior in two incidents almost exactly one year apart,"" Nelson told the court before the resumption of jury selection, noting Floyd called out for his ""mama"" in both arrests, according to video footage.
Prosecutors opposed the move, saying the defense was seeking to dirty the character of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who died after being handcuffed by police on May 25, 2020. Video of his death in which Chauvin, who is white, pushes Floyd's head into the road with a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes ignited global protests against police brutality and racism.
Matthew Frank, a prosecutor in the Minnesota attorney general's office, said the request showed ""the desperation of the defense to smear Mr. Floyd's character by showing that when he is struggling with an opioid addiction, like so many Americans do, it's really just evidence of bad character.""
In body-worn camera footage from the 2020 arrest, white froth can be seen around Floyd's mouth as police order him out of his car on suspicion he used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes at a nearby grocery store. 
Nelson is seeking to show jury evidence supporting his argument that the froth was the result of Floyd swallowing one or more opioid pill. Pills containing fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in Floyd's car; semi-chewed versions of such pills were found in the back of the police squad car where officers had struggled to get Floyd to sit, Nelson told the court.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill, overseeing the trial on an upper storey of a heavily guarded tower in downtown Minneapolis, said he would take at least a day to consider Nelson's request.
Cahill said he might allow evidence about the paramedic's findings in the 2019 arrest, saying it could be admissible evidence of Floyd's ""bodily response"" to ingesting a large amount of drugs. 
But he said he would quickly quash any effort to tell the jury: ""Don't feel sympathy for him because he was taking drugs.""
Prosecutors argued the prior arrest and Floyd's blood pressure on a date more than a year earlier were not relevant to the charges, and that the police response, involving officers other than those who responded in 2020, was different. In the 2019 arrest, officers were able to speak calmly with Floyd, seat him in the squad car and have him transported to a hospital for medical treatment. 
""Mr. Floyd had a history of hypertension, there's no doubt about that,"" Frank, the prosecutor, told the court. But it was wrong to argue that ""he was on notice and so therefore he somehow gave up the right to be treated reasonably by police officers.""
The other three officers are due to go on trial later this year on charges of aiding and abetting Chauvin. The Minneapolis Police Department fired all four officers the day after the deadly arrest.
Chauvin, 44, is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He has pleaded not guilty, saying he followed his police training, and has spent much of the trial taking notes on a yellow legal pad.
The court has seated nine jurors since the trial began last week, and plans to have opening arguments commence on March 29.
However, the defense has asked the judge to reconsider a request to move the trial to a different county after the city of Minneapolis announced last week it would pay $27 million to Floyd's family to settle their federal wrongful-death lawsuit. Cahill said he is considering the request and concerns publicity around the announcement may influence jurors.

Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted on the most serious charge.

RABAT (Reuters) - Morocco is further ahead with its COVID-19 vaccination programme than any other African country, but undocumented migrants are not a part of its plans, potentially undermining efforts to come to grips with the disease.
The COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged Morocco's tourism sector, and led to a drop in industrial exports. The country hopes that the inoculation programme will help its economy recover.
Its vaccination rate of 14 doses per 100 people has outperformed that of much wealthier France and Italy.
So far, the programme has concentrated on medics, other key workers, older people and those with chronic ailments, but the government has a stated goal of reaching herd immunity this summer.
It has obtained 8.5 million doses, including 7 million from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and 1 million from China's Sinopharm, and is also expected to approve Russia's Sputnik vaccine.
Asked about the risks a failure to vaccinate undocumented migrants could pose, one health ministry official in charge of the inoculation campaign said there was no official decision on the issue yet.Tens of thousands of legal foreign residents had been vaccinated, he added.
""As demand for vaccines exceeds supply (globally), we made sure to anticipate our needs and maintain vaccine supply uninterrupted,"" said the official, Abdelhakim Yahyane.
Some groups promoting migrants' rights said that missing out undocumented migrants could prove costly.
""The cost of not including undocumented migrants in the vaccination campaign is higher than the cost of the vaccine,"" said Younes Faudel, head of the Papiers pour Tous group.
Lying 14 km (nine miles) from Spain across the Strait of Gibraltar, Morocco has long been home to a large community of African migrants seeking to reach Europe.
Although it has given residency to more than 50,000 of them since 2013 as part of a wider effort to build alliances south of the Sahara, large numbers remain without formal paperwork.
""We all take the same buses and taxis and go to the same restaurants and markets,"" said Franck Iyanka, a Congolese national at the ODT labour union, urging authorities to include undocumented migrants in their plans. 
His union is one of several groups in Morocco that joined together last week to call on the state to extend residency to more migrants by issuing temporary documentation. 
There are no official figures for the number of undocumented migrants in Morocco. Iyanka said there were at least 20,000. 
Conde Cema, a Guinean villa guard in Rabat who has already tried unsuccessfully to cross twice to Europe, said he wanted to be vaccinated but could not since his residence permit had expired and his employer had not renewed his work contract. 

""I am willing to take the vaccine but without a valid residency card number I cannot register for it,"" said the 36-year-old, who has an 11-month-old baby.

Save the Children said it had spoken to displaced families who described ""horrifying scenes"" of murder, including mothers whose young sons were killed. In one case, the woman hid, helpless, with her three other children as her 12-year-old was murdered nearby. 
""We tried to escape to the woods, but they took my eldest son and beheaded him,"" the 28-year-old, who Save the Children called Elsa, is quoted as saying. 
""We couldn't do anything because we would be killed too.""
Another mother, a 29-year-old Save the Children calls Amelia, said her son was just 11 when he was killed by armed men. 
Reuters could not immediately reach Mozambique police or government spokespeople for comment. 
Mozambique's northernmost province of Cabo Delgado has since 2017 been home to a festering insurgency, linked to Islamic State, that has escalated dramatically in the past year. 
While beheadings have always been a hallmark of the attacks, throughout 2020 the insurgents began regularly engaging the military to capture and hold key towns. Brutality also continued, with mass killings including the murder of around 52 people at once in the village of Xitaxi in April.
Altogether almost 2,700 people on all sides have died in the violence, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a consultancy that tracks political violence. Almost 670,000 people have been displaced, Save the Children said. 
The United States last week declared the Mozambique group a foreign terrorist organisation over its links to Islamic State, saying the group reportedly pledged allegiance to it as early as 2018. Islamic State claimed its first attack in Cabo Delgado in June 2019.
The U.S. embassy in Mozambique on Monday said U.S. special forces will train Mozambican marines for two months, with the country also providing medical and communications equipment, to help Mozambique combat the insurgency. 
Amnesty International found earlier in March that war crimes were being committed by all sides in the conflict, with government forces also responsible for abuses against civilians - a charge the government has denied.
Chance Briggs, Save the Children's country director in Mozambique, said reports of attacks on children ""sicken us to our core"". 

""The violence has to stop and displaced families need to be supported as they find their bearings and recover from trauma,"" Briggs continued.

UMM AL-FAHM, Israel (Reuters) - At Tel Aviv's Dizengoff Circle, buzzing on a Saturday afternoon, around a dozen young people suddenly began to collapse slowly and theatrically to the ground, to the shock and confusion of Israelis out shopping or enjoying a coffee.
""Did it scare you?"", flash mob organiser Mohamd Jabarin asked those watching, and proceeded to explain the intention - to draw attention to a surge of shootings within Israel's Arab community and accuse police of failing to tackle the violence.
At least 24 Arab citizens of Israel have been shot dead this year, mostly by unknown assailants from within their towns and villages. The shootings, most often crime and gang related, have become a defining issue for the 21% minority ahead of a March 23 national election. 
The largest expression of the frustration and anger felt by the community has come through anti-violence protests by tens of thousands in Umm al-Fahm and other Arab towns. 
But the flash mobs are an attempt to raise awareness of the shootings in the heart of Jewish Israeli towns.
Demonstrators accuse the police of turning a blind eye to the violence, which they say is a result of poverty and years of underinvestment in their minority communities.
Israel's police say they investigate all shootings and are continuing their work to gather illegal weapons, arrest all criminals and bring them to justice. 
""The only solution for the inaction of the police ... is to take to the streets and mobilise the Palestinian Arab people,"" said Enab Mhajne, 19, at the Umm al-Fahm protest on Friday.
Behind her protesters waved Palestinian flags, an unusual sight on the streets of Israel.
Israel's Arabs - Palestinian by heritage, Israeli by citizenship - are mostly descended from the Palestinians who lived under Ottoman and then British colonial rule before staying in Israel after the country's creation in 1948.
Some Arab politicians have advocated working with right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address the violence.
Posters of Netanyahu have begun appearing in Arab neighbourhoods of cities like Haifa with a slogan bearing the Arabic slogan ""We are with you"".
Netanyahu, who many Arabs accuse of discrimination against their community, has pledged 100 million shekels ($30.24 million) to combat violence in Arab localities.
But Luna Hasan, another one of the flash mob organisers, said Arabs should focus on collective action to address the shootings, rather than rely on any one politician. 
""Arabs are represented in every aspect of the economy, in almost every aspect of life in Israel ... we deserve safety, and we deserve protection,"" Hasan, 24, said.

The Vatican said on Monday that priests cannot bless same-sex unions and that such blessings are not valid, in a ruling that disappointed gay Catholics who had hoped their Church was becoming more welcoming under Pope Francis.
In some countries, parishes and ministers have begun blessing same-sex unions in lieu of marriage, and there have been calls for bishops to institutionalise de facto such blessings. Conservatives in the 1.3 billion-member Roman Catholic Church have expressed alarm over such practices.
""We members of the Parish Priests Initiative are deeply appalled by the new Roman decree that seeks to prohibit the blessing of same-sex loving couples. This is a relapse into times that we had hoped to have overcome with Pope Francis,"" the Austrian-based group said in a statement.
""We will -- in solidarity with so many -- not reject any loving couple in the future who ask to celebrate God's blessing, which they experience every day, also in a worship service.""
The Parish Priests Initiative led by Father Helmut Schueller has long been a thorn in the side of the Vatican. The group wants Church rules changed so that priests can marry and women can become priests. 
It has said it will break Church rules by giving communion to Protestants and divorced Catholics who remarry.
Founded in 2006 by nine priests, the initiative says it now has around 350 members from the ranks of the official Church and more than 3,000 lay supporters.
The Vatican in 2012 cracked down on Schueller, stripping him of the right to use the title monsignor and saying he was also no longer a ""Chaplain of His Holiness"". 

Schueller, a former deputy to Vienna archbishop Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, had been given the honorary title in his capacity as head of the Austrian branch of the Catholic charity group Caritas.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas defended the U.S. response to a surge of unaccompanied children seeking to enter the United States at the southwest border on Tuesday, saying the region was on track to see more people trying to enter than any time in the last 20 years.
The government is creating a joint processing center to transfer the children, as young as 6 years old, promptly into the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and is trying to find additional shelters for them, Mayorkas said in a statement. 
""The situation we are currently facing at the southwest border is a difficult one. We are tackling it,"" he said.
President Joe Biden's administration has been racing to speed up the processing of hundreds of youths under 18 who are crossing the southern border alone every day from Central American countries and Mexico.
Officials have warned ""the border is not open"" and said they are sending back adults and families who have tried to cross it illegally since Biden took office promising to reverse some of predecessor Donald Trump's hard-line policies.
Administration officials have acknowledged their messaging is being countered by people smugglers and human traffickers who profit from the dangerous illegal journeys. 
""The smugglers' message is very pervasive, they prey on people and they prey on their hope and they tell them things that simply aren't true,"" Roberta Jackson, a White House adviser on immigration, said in an interview with CNN on Tuesday. ""But we are fighting back.""
Nearly 4,300 unaccompanied children were being held by Border Patrol officials as of Sunday, according to an agency official who requested anonymity. By law, the children should be transferred out of Customs and Border Protection facilities to HHS-run shelters within 72 hours.
Mayorkas acknowledged that Border Patrol facilities are crowded and that the 72-hour time frame for their transfer to HHS is not always met. 
In the short term, the federal government is setting up additional facilities in Texas and Arizona to shelter unaccompanied children and families, and is working with Mexico to increase its capacity to receive expelled families, he said.
Authorities are creating joint processing centers so children can be transferred immediately from Border Patrol to HHS, which is getting additional facilities to house the children until they are placed with families or sponsors, Mayorkas said.
They also will work with Mexico and international groups to expand an online platform that children can access to register for entry into the United States without taking the dangerous trip, he said.
Longer-term solutions include developing a formal refugee program that includes processing centers in Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
The Biden administration will soon issue a new regulation and other asylum reforms, including shortening the time it takes to adjudicate an asylum claim from years to months, Mayorkas said.
While poverty, violence and corruption in the Northern Triangle and Mexico have led people to seek a better life in the United States for years, Mayorkas said the coronavirus pandemic and two hurricanes have made the situation worse.
Republicans in Congress on Monday stepped up attacks on Biden over a surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, but were criticized in turn by Democrats for their own immigration record, as well as Trump's policies.

""The prior administration completely dismantled the asylum system. The system was gutted, facilities were closed, and they cruelly expelled young children into the hands of traffickers,"" Mayorkas said on Tuesday. ""We have had to rebuild the entire system.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli archaeologists racing against treasure hunters to search caves near the Dead Sea have discovered a trove of artefacts, including fragments of a biblical text, the like of which has not been seen for decades.
The finds, preserved by the hot, dry air of the Judean desert, also include the 6,000-year-old partly mummified skeleton of a child, and a perfectly intact, finely woven basket dating back 10,500 years that the Israel Antiquities Authority said on Tuesday was likely to be the oldest in the world.
The Authority has overseen a survey of more than 100 km (65 miles) of cliffs and the caves carved or eroded into them.
The fragments of parchment, about 2,000 years old, bear biblical verse, written in Greek, and match a scroll discovered about 60 years ago called the ""Book of the 12 Minor Prophets"".
That scroll is one of a trove of ancient Jewish texts called the Dead Sea Scrolls that were found in 1947 by local Bedouin in the caves of Qumran, about 20 km east of Jerusalem.
The collection, which has come to include texts discovered elsewhere along the western shore of the Dead Sea, provided a window into Jewish society and religion before and after the time of Jesus.
A flurry of exploration followed their discovery but the search eventually petered out - until recently, when new pieces of scrolls and parchment appeared on the black market.
The likelihood that antiquities robbers had found a new trove spurred the Authority into action.
Since 2017, crews have been abseiling down marl and limestone cliffs and using drones to map hundreds of caves and hollows.
Many were filled with centuries of sand and debris, and about a dozen thought to be likely hiding places were excavated fully.
The new fragments of manuscript were found in the ""Cave of Horror"", which years ago yielded up the 1,900-year-old skeletons of Jewish rebels who had fought against the Roman Empire.
""These are new pieces of the puzzle and we can add them to our greater picture of the period and of the text,"" said Oren Ableman of the Antiquities Authority's Dead Sea Scrolls Unit.
""Even though these pieces are small, they did give us some new information that we did not know before.""

The fragments allowed the reconstruction of 11 lines of text, and provided insight into the parchment the text is written on.

The Federal Public Prosecutor General (GBA) identified the suspect as Bai L., under German privacy rules which bar releasing the surname of suspects.
It said the suspect had been a member of Jammeh's elite guard, known as ""the junglers"", for three years starting in December 2003, and on at least three occasions drove officers to locations where they fired on the president's opponents.
According to a German judicial official, one of those was journalist Deyda Hydara, a critic of Jammeh's government who was shot dead in 2004 on the outskirts of the capital Banjul.
A Gambian army officer, Malick Jatta, testified two years ago before a truth commission in Gambia that he and two colleagues had shot Hydara dead on the ex-president's orders.
Bai L. was also charged with being the driver in attacks against a lawyer in 2003, and against another unidentified opponent of Jammeh, probably in 2006.
Police had searched his apartment in the northern city of Hannover, the GBA said. It did not say whether his arrest had been requested by Gambia.
Jammeh fled to Equatorial Guinea in 2017 after losing a presidential election, bringing an end to 22 years in power marked by extrajudicial killings, torture and forced disappearances as well as the embezzling of state assets.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka said on Tuesday a call to ban the wearing of the burqa was ""merely a proposal"", following criticism from regional allies ahead of a crucial United Nations vote on human rights in the island nation. 
Sri Lanka's minister for public security, Sarath Weerasekera, said on Saturday it would ""definitely"" ban the full face covering worn by some Muslim women on national security grounds, pending cabinet approval.
But the foreign ministry said on Tuesday a decision had not yet been taken on what it described as ""merely a proposal... under discussion"". 
""The government will initiate a broader dialogue with all parties concerned and sufficient time will be taken for necessary consultations to be held and for consensus to be reached,"" it said in a statement. 
Muslims make up around a tenth of the population in majority-Buddhist Sri Lanka. 
The statement follows criticism from Pakistan's ambassador to Sri Lanka, Saad Kattak, who said in a tweet on Monday a ban ""will only serve as injury to the feelings of ordinary Sri Lankan Muslims and Muslims across the globe"". 
Ahmed Shaheed, a Maldivian diplomat currently serving as the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, said a ban was incompatible with international laws that protect religious belief and freedom of expression. 
Several Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh, are among the 47 nations that will vote on Sri Lanka's human rights record at a United Nations session in Geneva next week.
A UN resolution passed against Sri Lanka could allow for prosecutions of government and military officials involved in ending a decades-long civil war in 2009, and Colombo is sensitive to anything that may impact voting there, according to a person familiar with the developments. 
Almost a third of the 47 nations are members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which last year criticised a Sri Lankan policy to forcibly cremate coronavirus victims in the country, in violation of the Islamic tradition of burial.

The policy was repealed last month.

WINDSOR, England (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Philip, the 99-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth, left a London hospital on Tuesday after a four-week stay for treatment for an infection and to have a heart procedure.
Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, was admitted to the private King Edward VII's Hospital on Feb. 16 after he felt unwell and was given treatment for an unspecified, but not COVID-19-related, illness.
He was transferred briefly at the start of this month to a specialist cardiac centre at another London hospital, where he underwent a procedure for a pre-existing heart condition.
A Reuters witness said the duke left the King Edward hospital shortly after 10.30 GMT on Tuesday. He was taken to a waiting car in a wheelchair and has arrived at Windsor Castle, the royal residence west of London.
There was no immediate comment from Buckingham Palace.
Since being admitted, the duke has been publicly visited only by his eldest son Prince Charles, the heir to the throne.
The queen, 94, has remained at Windsor Castle where the couple have been staying during the coronavirus pandemic, and has continued to carry out her official duties by video.
Both she and Philip have received their first COVID-19 vaccine dose.
The Greek-born prince, who turns 100 in June, has required hospital treatment a number of times in the last decade for a recurrence of a bladder infection.
At Christmas in 2011 he had an operation to clear a blocked artery in his heart after being rushed to hospital with chest pains.
During his latest hospital stay, the royal family has been embroiled in a crisis after his and Elizabeth's grandson Prince Harry and his wife Meghan gave a televised interview to Oprah Winfrey.
During the interview, Meghan said a member of the royal family had made a racist comment while Harry criticised his relatives for failing to stand up to what he regarded as abusive press treatment of his wife.
Harry also said his father, Charles, had let him down and that he had felt trapped in his royal life.
The comments led Buckingham Palace to issue a statement on the queen's behalf saying she was saddened by what they had said, while Harry's elder brother William told reporters: ""We're very much not a racist family"".
Philip, who has been at the queen's side throughout her 69-year reign, has always been considered the patriarch of the royal family privately, while always deferring to his wife in public and over state affairs.

However, since he retired from public life in 2017 he has taken more of a backseat role, with Prince Charles and Prince William, both future kings, taking on greater responsibilities.

Novaya Gazeta, whose reporters have been subjected to numerous attacks since it was founded after the Soviet Union collapsed, reported a foul chemical smell at its Moscow editorial offices on Monday, which it described as a deliberate attack. No one was reported hurt.. 
Emergency service sources cited by Russian news agencies said nothing dangerous had been detected and that the smell appeared to have come from a basement sewer. 
But on Tuesday, Novaya Gazeta circulated a video published on social media that it said showed a hooded figure dressed as a Moscow food courier pausing by its office with a bicycle and spraying a substance for several seconds before walking off. 
Reuters could not independently verify the video's authenticity. 
Novaya Gazeta proposed conducting a joint investigation with the Moscow government.
""This can't be left like this. It's a threat to Muscovites,"" the newspaper said in a statement on its website. 

One of the newspaper's journalists, Anna Politkovskaya, was shot dead in Moscow in 2006 after exposing abuses in a war in the southern Russian region of Chechnya.

The political and economic crisis over the Feb. 1 ouster of the elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi could also soon mean hunger for the poor who are facing rising food and fuel prices across the country, the U.N. food agency warned.
Security forces shot dead at least 20 people on Monday after 74 were killed a day earlier, including many in a suburb of Yangon where Chinese-financed factories were torched, according to advocacy group the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP).
On Tuesday, a crematorium in Yangon reported 31 funerals, a mourner at one of the ceremonies said.
Hundreds of young mourners spilled out on to the street at the funeral of medical student Khant Nyar Hein who was killed in Yangon on Sunday, the bloodiest day of the protests.
""Let them kill me right now, let them kill me instead of my son because I can't take it any more,"" the student's mother was seen saying in a video clip posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Mourners chanted: ""Our revolution must prevail.""
Some families told media the security forces had seized the bodies of loved ones but they would still hold a funeral.
At least 184 people have been killed by the security forces in the weeks of protests, the AAPP said, with the toll rising on Tuesday as one protester was shot dead in the central town of Kawlin, a resident there said.
People held up pictures of Suu Kyi and called for an end to the repression during a small protest in the southern town of Dawei on Tuesday, the Dawei Watch media outlet reported. There was no report of violence. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was appalled by the escalating violence and called on the international community to help end the repression, his spokesman said, while the United States also denounced the bloodshed.
""The military is attempting to overturn the results of a democratic election and is brutally repressing peaceful protesters,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a news conference in Tokyo.
A junta spokesman did not answer telephone calls to seek comment and Reuters could not independently confirm all the casualties.
'STOP KILLING'
State broadcaster MRTV said martial law had been imposed in parts of Yangon and military commanders would take over administration of districts and courts.
The U.N. human rights office said some 37 journalists had been arrested, including 19 who remained in detention, while ""deeply distressing"" reports of torture in custody had emerged and five people were known to have died in detention.
""We call on the military to stop killing and detaining protesters,"" the office's spokeswoman, Ravina Shamdasani, told a briefing in Geneva.
The army said it took power after its accusations of fraud in a Nov. 8 election won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) were rejected by the electoral commission. It has promised to hold a new election but has not set a date.
The military ruled the former British colony for decades after a 1962 coup and cracked down hard on uprisings before beginning a tentative transition to democracy a decade ago. 
That has been derailed and instead the protests and a civil disobedience campaign of strikes are paralysing large parts of the economy and could undermine the ability of poor families to feed themselves, the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) warned.
The WFP said the price of rice was up as much as 35% in parts of the north and prices of cooking oil and pulses were also higher, while the cost of fuel had risen by 15% since Feb. 1.
""These rising food and fuel prices are compounded by the near paralysis of the banking sector, slowdowns in remittances, and widespread limits on cash availability,"" the WFP said.
Suu Kyi, 75, has been detained since the coup and faces various charges including illegally importing walkie-talkie radios and infringing coronavirus protocols.
Western countries have called for her release and condemned the violence while Asian neighbours have offered to help resolve the crisis, but Myanmar has a long record of rejecting outside intervention.
Authorities had detained an official from Open Society Myanmar, a group set up with the help of the foundation of billionaire philanthropist George Soros, and are looking for 11 other employees on suspicion they passed funds to opponents of the coup, a state-run newspaper said.

Sunday's arson attacks on 32 Chinese-invested factories in a Yangon industrial district prompted China's strongest comments yet on the turmoil in its neighbour. It urged the military to stop the violence, punish perpetrators and protect its people.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov made the remarks when asked to comment on a U.S. government report which appeared to show that the United States had tried to dissuade Brazil from buying Sputnik V.
The report, published on the website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), detailed the work of the U.S. Office of Global Affairs (OGA) in ""combating malign influences in the Americas"". 
The report outlined the agency's diplomatic efforts to counter what it described as attempts by countries, including Russia, to increase their influence in the region, to the detriment of U.S. safety and security. 
""Examples include using OGA's Health Attache office to persuade Brazil to reject the Russian COVID-19 vaccine,"" the government report said. 
Kremlin spokesman Peskov declined to comment specifically on the report but said Russia was against politicizing the situation around vaccines.
""In many countries the scale of pressure is quite unprecedented ... such selfish attempts to force countries to abandon any vaccines have no prospects,"" he said.
""We believe that there should be as many doses of vaccines as possible so that all countries, including the poorest, have the opportunity to stop the pandemic,"" Peskov said.

Yemen's Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik and other members of the internationally recognised government remain holed up inside the building, two Yemeni officials said.
Most of Aden is controlled by forces of the United Arab Emirates-backed separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), which had fought the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in the past.
Abdulmalik's cabinet was formed last year to unite the STC with Hadi's government and fulfil a Saudi aim of ending a feud among Riyadh's allies.
The two groups are the main Yemeni factions in a Saudi-backed alliance fighting the Houthis, who control the north, including the capital Sanaa.
Tuesday's protest broke out over public services and after the government failed to pay salaries of retired soldiers, the witnesses said.
Footage on social media showed Aden's security chief, Mathar al-Shaebe, negotiating with a group of protesters and asking them to leave the security perimeter of Maasheq Palace. 
The Houthis seized control of Sanaa in September 2014, forcing the then government into exile in Riyadh and Aden. In March the following year, the Saudi-led coalition launched a campaign to try to restore Hadi's government, carrying out thousands of air raids.
Tens of thousands have been killed, mostly civilians, and millions of Yemenis have been pushed to the brink of famine.

Everard, 33, was abducted as she walked home from a friend's house in south London on March 3, with her body later found in woodland around 50 miles away in southeast England.
Wayne Couzens, 48, a London officer whose role it was to guard diplomatic premises, appeared by videolink from prison at the British capital's Old Bailey central criminal court on Tuesday.
A provisional trial date was set for Oct. 25 and he is due to enter a plea in July. Wearing a red T-shirt, Couzens, who police said needed treatment for a head injury while in custody, had a noticeable cut on his forehead. 
He made no application for bail. 
The murder of Everard has provoked outpourings of anger from women who have recounted their own experiences and fears of walking the streets on their own at night, while the police have faced severe criticism for how they handled a vigil for the murdered woman on Saturday when officers scuffled with mourners.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson chaired a meeting on Monday night to discuss what reassurances women could be given, and the government promised more money for better street lighting and to pilot schemes where plain clothes officers would visit pubs and clubs to ""identify predatory and suspicious offenders"".

""The horrific case of Sarah Everard has unleashed a wave of feeling about women not feeling safe at night,"" Johnson said. ""We must do everything we can to ensure our streets are safe.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - The sister of North Korean leader, Kim Yo Jong, criticised ongoing military drills in South Korea and warned the new U.S. administration that the smell of cordite wafting over the border would not help bring peace, state news reported on Tuesday.
Kim's statement was the North's first public message to Washington since President Joe Biden took office in January. It was delivered a day before U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are due to arrive in Seoul for their first talks with South Korean counterparts.
""We take this opportunity to warn the new U.S. administration trying hard to give off powder smell in our land,"" Kim said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA. ""If it wants to sleep in peace for coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step.""
For all the imagery of Kim's words, the joint springtime military drill begun last week was limited to computer simulations because of the coronavirus risk as well as the ongoing efforts to engage with the North.
But her message was clear.
""War drills and hostility can never go with dialogue and cooperation,"" Kim Yo Jong said.
When asked about Kim Yo Jong's statement, Blinken told a briefing in Tokyo that he was aware of her comments, but that he was more interested in hearing what America's allies and partners think about North Korea.
Blinken and Austin are travelling in Asia this week for foreign policy and security talks with allies in Japan and South Korea, among other stops.
The new U.S. administration is expected to wrap up a review of North Korea policy in coming weeks. And Blinken said Washington is considering whether additional pressure on North Korea could be effective.
The timing of Kim's comments seems designed to ensure that North Korea will be at the top of Blinken and Austin's agenda when they land in Seoul, said Ramon Pacheco Pardo, a Korea expert at King's College London.
""Until now, the discussion was focusing on The Quad, dealing with China and the North Korea policy review,"" he said. ""Now Kim's statement will be central to discussions.""
North Korea has so far rebuffed entreaties from the United States to engage in dialogue, the White House said on Monday, as a chill in relations that began under then-President Donald Trump has extended into Biden's presidency.
Leader Kim Jong Un had three high-profile summit meetings with Trump and exchanged a series of letters, but the nuclear-armed state ended talks and said it would not engage further unless the United States drops its hostile policies.
'SHRUNKEN WAR GAMES'
Kim Yo Jong mocked South Korea for ""resorting to shrunken war games, now that they find themselves in the quagmire of political, economic and epidemic crisis.""
Boo Seung-chan, a spokesman for South Korea's Ministry of Defence, said the drills were routine and defensive in nature.
""The ministry's position is that North Korea must show a flexible attitude, such as responding to dialogue, to build a lasting and solid peace on the Korean Peninsula,"" he told a briefing.
The inter-Korean engagement that had improved in 2018 and is sought by South Korea ""won't come easily again"" and North Korea will be watching to see if there is further provocations, said Kim.
She said North Korea would consider pulling out of an inter-Korean military agreement aimed at reducing tensions along their shared border, and would review whether to dissolve several organisations aimed at cooperation with the South.

Kim's statement, as colourful as it is, is generally consistent with past North Korean statements expressing frustrations at disparities between words and actions, said Jenny Town, director of 38 North, a U.S.-based website that tracks North Korea.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - New Delhi was the world's most polluted capital for the third straight year in 2020, according to IQAir, a Swiss group that measures air quality levels based on the concentration of lung-damaging airborne particles known as PM2.5.
India was home to 35 of the world's 50 most polluted cities, according to IQAir's 2020 World Air Quality Report, which gathered data for 106 countries.
The findings were based on the country's annual average of particulate matter PM2.5, airborne particles with less than 2.5 microns in diameter. Prolonged exposure to PM2.5 can lead to deadly diseases, including cancer and cardiac problems. 
In 2020, New Delhi's average annual concentration of PM2.5 in a cubic meter of air was 84.1, the study said, more than double the level of Beijing, which averaged 37.5 during the year, making it the 14th most polluted city in the world.
Air pollution caused an estimated 54,000 premature deaths in New Delhi in 2020, according to a recent study by Greenpeace Southeast Asia Analysis and IQAir.
Despite an 11% reduction in the annual average of PM2.5 levels due to nationwide coronavirus lockdown curbs imposed last year, India emerged as the world's third most polluted country after Bangladesh and Pakistan.
""Air pollution in India is still dangerously high,"" the report said. 
In 2020, South Asia endured some of the world's worst air quality on record, it said. 
Last year, Delhi's 20 million residents, who breathed some of the cleanest air on record in summer months due to the lockdown curbs, battled toxic air in winter, following a sharp increase in farm fire incidents in the neighbouring state of Punjab. 

As the burning of crop stubble peaked, Delhi's PM2.5 levels averaged 144 micrograms per cubic metre in November and 157 micrograms per cubic metre in December, exceeding the World Health Organisation's annual exposure guideline by more than 14 times, it said.

SAMAWA DESERT, Iraq (Reuters) - ""Here it is, the truffle, a blessing from God!"" Zahra Buheir carefully digs out a desert truffle from the sandy earth and shows it off between her calloused fingers.
    ""Rain came, and then thunder, bringing truffles up to the surface,"" the 72-year-old said.
    Braving the harsh weather of Iraq's southern desert, as well as left-behind land mines, Buheir and her family of seven have spent weeks hunting for the seasonal truffles that have provided them with an income for generations.
    Fetching its hunters up to $7 a kilo this year, Iraq's desert truffle is cheaper than its rarer European cousins that can cost hundreds of dollars or more a kilo.
    But with Iraq's economy in crisis, the local variety are a big help to Buheir and her family.
    This year the rain came late and Buheir could only find about a kilo of truffles a day, one tenth of what she would dig up in a good year.
    Turning over stones and poking the earth with her bare hands, Buheir's granddaughter, 5-year-old Riyam, accompanied her parents to learn a trade and the desert lifestyle.
    ""When there is no work, truffles are a source of income. And we are happy here,"" said Riyam's father Mohsen Farhan, who cherishes the weeks he spends with his family in their tent in the desert. 
    Learning to hunt for truffles these days also involves understanding the desert's dangers.
    ""We are afraid of wolves, there are a lot here. And there are mines. A while ago, someone died,"" Farhan said.
    Remnants from the Gulf war in 1991, unexploded devices beneath the earth could be mistaken for truffles by the inexperienced eye.
    Every few days, Hussein Abu Ali, drives into the desert from the city of Samawa to take the truffles to market.
    There, Ali Tajj al-Din sells them at auction, each with a different name according to size.
    ""These are walnuts, eggs, oranges, and here is the pomegranate, the biggest one,"" he said.
    This year, scarcity has pushed up prices and truffles that don't sell locally are exported to wealthier Gulf countries.
    But customers at Samawa's ""Beit al-Hatab"" restaurant relish its weekly truffle speciality.

    ""We fry or grill them, but the favourite dish is truffles on rice,"" said restaurant owner Fawwaz Hatab.

JINGHONG, China (Reuters) - In the border district of Xishuangbanna in southwest China's Yunnan province, the global pandemic has put residents of the small ethnic minority village of Mandian under pressure to change old habits.
Behind a traditional homestead with a small garden of medicinal herbs and a veranda lined with beehives, a sign posted on the edge of the forest says, ""Do not enter the protected zone without authorisation.""
""Because of environmental protection, we aren't allowed to go in anymore,"" said local resident Yu Yao. 
She said inspectors come and visit every month to ensure the new restrictions are being enforced, adding that permission is needed even to fell a tree.
Home to around half of the country's protected animal and plant species, Yunnan is on the front line of China's efforts to redefine its relationship with nature and reduce health risks. 
Believed by many to be the source of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, the province aims to build a ""southwest ecological security barrier for the motherland,"" vice governor Qiu Jiang said at China's national session of parliament on March 6. 
It has already put nearly a third of its territory behind an ""ecological protection red line"" that restricts human activities. Much of that is in Xishuangbanna on the border with Laos and Myanmar. It's the home of China's last surviving elephant community, located in a sliver of forest about 5 miles from the Mekong river.
Experts say decades of deforestation in China and elsewhere have disturbed ancient ecosystems, destroyed habitats and let loose countless potentially lethal pathogens.
""We have an incredibly huge, unprecedented, human-animal interface across the planet,"" said Peter Daszak, zoologist and President of the OneHealth Alliance, a non-profit organisation. 
""There are deforestation events, and wildlife trade, and until we deal with that, we are going to see more and more pandemics.""
HARMONY WITH NATURE?
Acknowledging the role played by habitat destruction in the coronavirus outbreak, China last year imposed tough curbs on wildlife trading and drew up policies to better protect rivers, wetlands and forests. 
The policies are already having an impact. Though the 300 ethnic Dai inhabitants of Mandian village have subsisted comfortably off the forest for years, they are now unwilling to risk being fined, residents said.
Yunnan is also under pressure to enforce its so-called red lines more rigorously and crack down on the illegal occupation of protected land. Xishuangbanna also launched a campaign in December to stop local farmers from illegally expanding their tea plantations. 
A local wildlife protection officer told Reuters that he and his team have been inundated with work since the the start of 2020. 
""There's been a much bigger emphasis on protection and a greater awareness of the risks among the public and the government,"" said the officer, who did not want to be identified.
But Xishuangbanna has also struggled to find the means and the manpower to enforce the rules, he added.
""We are spending longer and longer inside the forest, but we need more facilities - and we need more Toyotas.""
Though signs warn against trespassing into protected areas, sites visited by Reuters still show considerable human activity, including farming and logging. 
The protection officer said it was impossible to track every encroachment in a region where total forest coverage - including rubber plantations - stands at 80%. Authorities have also struggled to prevent farmers from intruding on ecosystems to plant more crops.
""In some areas, the local residents would take one line of trees a year,"" said Alice Hughes, a botanist based at the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Gardens, a research facility and tourist attraction. 
URBAN SPRAWL
Beyond Yunnan's fragmented nature reserves, the churn of urbanisation continues. Xishuangbanna's population has doubled in 40 years, its ethnic minorities subsumed in an urban sprawl centred on Jinghong, the region's political centre. 
Scholars worry that while the ""red line"" scheme protects 30% of Yunnan's territory, little is being done elsewhere. 
A study published last year said existing schemes ""do not offer adequate protection"", with nearly 25% of the region's biodiversity hotspots not covered. Another 2020 paper showed Jinghong had lost a quarter of its tropical forest since 1999.
""Ecological red-lining has huge potential,"" said Hughes. ""But there's a lot of biodiversity that is falling through the cracks."" 
AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN
Scientists have long identified southeast Asia - with its vast bat populations and unregulated wildlife trading networks - as one of the most likely origins of a lethal viral spillover. 
Coronaviruses could have been endemic for years, but the range of human exposure has been vastly increased by the arrival of thousands of migrants and tourists, together with the construction of new high-speed road and rail links and the extension of wildlife trade networks into new ecological niches.
""The world has become a much smaller place,"" said Hughes. ""Local populations will often be immune to local pathogens because they've been exposed repeatedly at low doses."" 
""But if then their relatives from the big city or from overseas come, they have no immunity and that means they can contract it and they can spread it.""
In 2018, more than a year before COVID-19 was discovered in the city of Wuhan, Daszak and his team set out to explore the risks of zoonotic disease in rural southern China. They found that human-animal interactions were frequent and conducted with ""low levels of environmental biosecurity"". 

""It is not one person every 10 years that leads to an outbreak, but thousands of people, maybe millions every year,"" Daszak said.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's populist presidential front-runner Yonhy Lescano plans to renegotiate a fairer distribution of mining wealth if elected to lead the world's No. 2 copper producer and also allow imports of cheaper natural gas, he told Reuters less than a month before an April ballot.
Lescano, 62, a former lawmaker and leader of the Popular Action party, has emerged as the favorite in polls heading toward the April 11 first round vote. He will very likely face a second round run-off in June.
In an interview at his home in Surco, a quiet residential district of the capital Lima, the lawyer said the contrast between the Andean country's booming mining sector and relatively poor populace was ""a terrible contradiction."" 
""That wealth is not even reaching the inhabitants who are next to the mining sites, something is wrong here, we must correct that,"" Lescano said.
Copper, silver and gold mined from Peru's highlands and lowland Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) represent 60% of its exports and are vital to the economy. But protests are mounting as citizens demand greater benefits and tighter controls to ensure environmental and social sustainability. 
Mineral-rich Peru boasts a $56 billion waiting list of new mine projects at a time of soaring prices for copper and other metals. Lescano said this leaves room for negotiation to ensure more profits stay in Peru.
""We are not going to make order by supreme decree or by law, but rather we will sit at a table and renegotiate,"" he said.
POLITICAL POPULIST
Lescano, a populist who has risen quickly through the polls in the past month, is a father of three originally from Puno, an Andean city on the shores of the high-altitude Lake Titicaca. 
He is favored in southern Peru, a region that historically leans left, but also by older, more conservative Peruvians. 
Several of his policies are aimed at lowering costs for the country's poor and middle class citizens, who have been particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus crisis.
Lescano told Reuters he hopes to lower the cost of natural gas - which accounts for nearly half of country's energy supply - by ratcheting up competition and allowing gas imports. He said he would support the construction of a gas pipeline between Bolivia and Peru.
""If you allow Bolivian gas (into Peru), prices will fall, because Bolivia has much cheaper gas,"" he said.
The candidate said he would also improve access to credit by forcing private banks to reduce ""abusive"" interest rates and that he could encourage Peru's state Banco de la Nacion to enter the market and compete with private lenders.
Lescano holds conservative views on some social issues, including being opposed to abortion, same-sex marriage and education in schools around gender identity.
He said he would tackle rampant corruption that has seen five former presidents probed or prosecuted for corruption in just over two decades, by banning officials who accept bribes to ever work for the state, a punishment he called ""civil death"".
Lescano explained his political ideology was governed by three rules inherited from the Inca Empire that dominated the country prior to the arrival of Europeans: ""Ama sua"", ""Ama Llulla"" and ""Ama Quella"", Quechua phrases that mean ""don't be a thief"", ""don't be a liar"" and ""don't be lazy"".

Six university lecturers were also wounded during the attack in Baghlan province, said Sayed Hamid Rushan, a spokesman for the interior ministry said. 
The ministry blamed the Taliban for the attack, but the militant group denied involvement.
""The attack...has nothing to do with our mujahideen (fighters), we condemn the attack and consider it as a conspiracy of the enemy,"" said Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman.
On the other side of the country, unidentified gunmen attacked security forces guarding a dam in Herat, killing three, wounding one, according to officials in the western province. Four other members of the security forces were missing. 
Diplomats and advocates have become alarmed at the rising violence, including targeted attacks on government employees, journalists, academics and rights workers in recent months even as peace negotiations were being held in Qatar. 
Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a statement on Tuesday condemning the targeted killings, especially those against minority groups, women and journalists.
""Unidentified attackers have also gone after journalists, civil society activists, and professionals, killing many, driving some from the country, and leaving the rest to live in fear,"" said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at HRW.

Opponents of military rule launched a civil disobedience movement (CDM) of strikes to press the generals to reverse their coup, free detained government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and recognise her party's Nov. 8 election victory.
The military has responded with a crackdown on pro-democracy protests, killing more than 180 people over weeks, a human rights group said, while taking legal action against Suu Kyi and others.
The Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper, which has been for years a mouthpiece of the military, said the Open Society Myanmar (OSM) organisation transferred funds without seeking permission from the Foreign Exchange Management Department.
The group then exchanged $1.4 million into Myanmar's kyat currency ""without following the necessary rules and regulations"", the paper said. 
It then suggested that unidentified non-governmental organisations were ""providing cash assistance to CDM movements"".
The paper said the finance officer of Open Society Myanmar, Phyu Pa Pa Thaw, had been interrogated since last Friday about ""that cash flow into the CDM movement"".
Authorities were looking for 11 other OSM employees to interrogate them, it added.
On its website, the Open Society Foundations says it is the world’s largest private funder of independent groups working for justice, democratic governance, and human rights.
It provides grants through a network of national and regional foundations and offices, funding an array of projects.
It says the Myanmar foundation supports ""civil society and groups representing marginalized people to encourage a representative democracy to take root"".
Authoritarian governments regularly attack Soros and his organisation for its work, and he has been the target of conspiracy theories and social media misinformation for years.
The newspaper published a picture of Suu Kyi meeting Soros in 2016 in New York and of her meeting his son, Alexander Soros, in Myanmar, but it did not link Suu Kyi or the Open Society Foundations to any alleged irregular transfer of funds.
The Open Society Foundations did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

558,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 04:35AM ET</span>",Netherlands eases rules for mail-in ballots as election continues,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch government on Tuesday said that it would adjust rules for accepting mail-in ballots in an ongoing national election, after reports people had made a minor mistake in the proceedure.
The election, in which Prime Minister Mark Rutte's conservative VVD Party is expected to gain enough support to secure a fourth term, is running for three days, March 15-17, to allow social distancing room at polling stations. 
In addition, people 70 years and older were allowed to vote by mail for the first time.
An estimated 6% of voters cast a ballot in person on the 15th, with the lion's share expected to vote in person on the 17th. Mail-in votes have already been received but will not be tallied until the 17th, with roughly a third of eligible seniors expected to vote by mail.
After reports of mistakes, Interior Affairs Minister Kasja Ollongren said in a letter to parliament on Tuesday that ballots from voters who had included their voting pass in an inner envolope, rather than outside it in a second envelope as instructed, would be counted anyway.
Five polls released this week showed Rutte's conservative VVD taking 21-26% of the vote, compared with 11-16% for its closest rival, Geert Wilders' anti-Islam Freedom Party. A member of Rutte's current coalition, the pro-European D-66 Party, has pulled level with Freedom in recent polls.
With a ban on public gatherings, the election campaign focused on a series of televised debates in which Rutte maintained his image as a steady hand during a time of crisis.

But coronavirus infections in the Netherlands are rising at the fastest pace in months, and the National Institute for Health (RIVM) has advised against easing lockdown measures, saying that hospitals could still be overwhelmed in a third wave of the pandemic driven by more contagious variants.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A proposed new law that tightens patriotic loyalty tests for Hong Kong politicians could also ensnare the city's judges, further threatening its vaunted judicial independence, say legal scholars, lawyers and diplomats.
They warn that the so-called ""negative list"" - which proscribes unpatriotic acts - under the oath-taking bill is far too vague and could put judges under intense pressure if their rulings and judgments are viewed as challenging the government.
The bill, launched last month and due to be debated in the city's legislature this week, is part of a new drive by the Chinese and Hong Kong governments to ensure only ""patriots"" govern the city.
Long seen as the bedrock on which Hong Kong's freedoms and international financial status are built, the city's independent judiciary and common-law-based legal system have grown in importance since the imposition of a sweeping national security law in June.
Diplomats, businesspeople and activists say that as various Hong Kong institutions crumble, including the legislature, local media and academia, the judiciary is the key remaining check on Beijing's tightening authoritarian grip on its freest city.
Much of the bill involves ways that legislators and community-level district councilors can be disqualified if their oaths are deemed insincere. Such moves are expected to pave the way for mass disqualification of the pro-democracy politicians who humiliated the pro-Beijing camp when they won district polls by a landslide in 2019.
But as the city's ranks of judges, including leading foreign jurists, must take oaths to Hong Kong under long-standing requirements, they also come under the sweep of the legislation.
'HOLISTIC LOVE'
Launching the bill last month, Hong Kong's Secretary for Mainland and Constitutional Affairs Erick Tsang said the law fulfilled ""the constitutional responsibility of the government"".
Tsang defined patriotism as a ""holistic love"" that included the leadership of China's ruling Communist Party.
Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong law school, said the vague nature of some of the elements of the negative list could spark intense scrutiny and complaints.
He singled out references to acts that had a ""tendency"" to undermine the order of the political structure or the ""overall interests"" of Hong Kong.
""These references are extremely vague and it creates more possible complications for how the judiciary itself has to regulate judges against these new standards,"" Young told Reuters. ""There is still time to clarify things... the point is we should not be defining these specific parameters of the oath in such vague ways with such over-reaching scope that it could undermine judicial independence.""
A spokesman for the judiciary said that because of judicial independence, it was inappropriate for it to comment on any legislative proposals. The Hong Kong government did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters. 
The spokesman added that it had been stated in ""express terms"" that Hong Kong's courts ""shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference"".
""As reflected in their judicial oath, in exercising their judicial power, judges are required to determine and handle cases strictly in accordance with the law and legal principles,"" the judiciary spokesman said.
The legislation would still have to comply with the Basic Law, which outlines judicial independence, including legal immunity for judges.
Senior lawyers warned the proposals added a new layer of outside political scrutiny and could complicate long-standing arrangements involving the appointment and disciplining of judges.
""The shift here is that you are not swearing to uphold a constitutional principle or value, but are expected to effectively make an oath to a party or an individual,"" one veteran lawyer said.
A senior Western envoy said that the city's once-extensive autonomy was ""hanging by a thread"" and that the ""judges are all that is left.""

""We are telling the Hong Kong and Chinese governments not only that we and our business communities are watching closely, but that we are all deeply concerned at the prospect of what Beijing is styling as reforms putting extra pressure on the legal system,"" the envoy said. ""The judiciary must be left alone to do its work.""

AMMAN (Reuters) - In the back alleys of the old city of Damascus, Yaseen al-Obeid carries sacks of bricks to make some extra cash and supplement his monthly foreman's salary of $15.
Like many other Syrians, one job is not enough; the 52-year-old has to find money to feed his wife and six children.
""Every time I go to bed I say to myself that I hope a rocket comes and kills me and rids me of this life,"" he told Reuters via video link from his home in a run-down part of the Syrian capital.
Obeid's problems are common among the estimated 17 million people left in Syria after a decade-long civil war that decimated the economy, killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced more than 11 million, or around half the pre-war population.
President Bashar al-Assad, who with the help of Russian and Iranian forces has all but crushed the insurgency, faces a challenge that may be just as daunting - rebuilding a country from the rubble when economic headwinds are gaining strength.
The country is not yet at peace. Hostile Turkey controls territory in the northwest where many of the four million people who fled Assad's bombing see Ankara as their protector.
The United States has a small military presence in the northeast that underpins Kurdish forces in a region where major oilfields are located and much of the country's wheat was grown.
And now, with tightening U.S. sanctions, neighbouring Lebanon's financial collapse, COVID-19 hitting remittances from Syrians abroad and allies Russia and Iran unable to provide enough relief, the prospects for economic recovery look poor.
""You don't have sources of foreign currency, neither oil nor wheat - all of it we are paying from scarce hard currency. The government's resources are limited,"" said leading Damascus-based Syrian businessman Khalil Touma.
The government did not respond to questions about its economic record and about dissatisfaction over people's worsening financial situation.
In televised speeches over the last year, Assad has blamed Western sanctions for Syria's economic woes, and late in 2020 also pointed to the Lebanese banking crisis that has frozen Syrian depositors out of their accounts.
A cumulative total of $226 billion in gross domestic product was lost due to the civil war from 2011 to 2016, according to the World Bank.
More recently, purchasing power has collapsed along with the Syrian pound, which began to slide in late 2019 and hit a new low of 4,000 to the dollar this month.
A new 5,000 Syrian pound note issued in January was a reminder to some of the threat of hyperinflation, although the government said that was not the reason for the new note.
The pound's fall has wiped out much of Obeid's income. His salary was worth far more when it traded at 47 to the dollar before the conflict.
What hurts most is hearing his children tell him they go to bed hungry.
""My son tells me 'I have not filled my stomach'. They sleep without eating.""
QUEUEING FOR BREAD
The country's food subsidy system used to supplement Obeid's salary, guaranteeing cheap bread. But cracks have begun to show, with residents saying that queues for bread across government-controlled areas can run up to five hours long as wheat imports dwindle.
Witnesses said fights had broken out, although open dissent against the authorities is still relatively rare amid fears that they will crack down to quell it.
The government did not respond to questions about whether it sought to stifle dissent.
Memories are still fresh of how peaceful protests in 2011 were met with deadly force, fuelling an insurgency against Assad's government that became a multi-sided war.
Another uprising against him looks unlikely, ahead of elections later in 2021 which he appears certain to win.
The government has reduced bread and gasoline allowances in an attempt to cut waste, but some businessmen say not all of its economic policies are working.
""There are a lot of decisions taken by the government that actually put up obstacles rather than make matters easier,"" Touma said.
In Damascus, some residents say that signs of economic strain are everywhere, including beggars and homeless people roaming the streets of more affluent areas.
Meanwhile, the lifestyle of Syria's elite appears relatively untouched behind the gated compounds of Yafour neighbourhood close to the Damascus-Beirut highway.
Smart restaurants are teeming with customers.
""There is extreme spending on luxuries by a group who pay in foreign currency ... This is not the time,"" Touma told Reuters.
Syria's educated middle class is also suffering.
Some have lost thousands of dollars of savings they invested in banks in Lebanon, once a safe haven amid war and sanctions.
Garment trader Ibrahim Shahloub used to go to Beirut regularly to collect the interest on his savings and keep his family afloat.
With Lebanon's banks freezing depositors out of their accounts as the country went into financial meltdown, he cannot access his money.
""The only hope we had was to go to Europe and we did not. The hope has gone, it has died, it has been buried,"" he said.
LOYALISTS UNHAPPY
Salary increases for war veterans and the military establishment cannot keep up with spiralling prices, and even in Jabla in the Mediterranean province of Latakia - an Assad family stronghold - some Syrians say they are unhappy.
Iskander Najoum, a former fighter for a pro-Assad militia, has adorned his walls with pictures of the leader and a fallen brother Ali. He talks with pride about Assad's visit to his hometown last October after it was hit by forest fires.
But despite the veneration, Najoum is angry with officials he says have stolen funds meant to compensate farmers for the fires that swept the coastal province, the worst in decades. 
""How are we going to fight corruption and bribery? How can an employee live on 60,000 pounds?"" asked Najoum, who lost his left hand in the fighting. ""Is this our reward for standing up to terrorism for 10 years and giving everything?""
The government did not respond to a question about people's perception of corruption among officials.
Rare protests over eroding living conditions in government-controlled areas fizzled out last year, but frustration remains over dwindling supplies of bread and fuel.
Keeping a tight lid on dissent is a priority ahead of presidential elections, Syrians familiar with official thinking said.
Some activists say fear of arrest has already muzzled a once vocal social media, after dozens of students, civil servants, a judge and prominent journalists were detained for speaking out about poor living conditions and alleged corruption.
In a recent case, Hala Jerf, 54, a prominent television presenter and long-time supporter of Assad, was arrested at a checkpoint near Damascus in January on her way to work after she posted Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts critical of the government.
""Putting the spotlight on corruption and the corrupt is a bigger crime than corruption itself,"" said Rajaa Jerf, Hala's sister.
The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Jerf's case.
Suhaib Ibrahim, a former university student, joined peaceful demonstrations and later fought for the rebels after losing his mother and sister in airstrikes on Jobar, 2 km northeast of the old city walls of Damascus.
He, for one, saw little chance of renewed protests.

""They have not changed anything and things only got much worse,"" he said. ""We paid dearly.""

Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted the elected government and detained its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, with protests and a civil disobedience campaign of strikes paralysing parts of the economy.
The World Food Programme (WFP) said food prices were rising with palm oil 20% higher in some places around the main city of Yangon since the beginning of February and rice prices up 4% in the Yangon and Mandalay areas since the end of February.
In some parts of Kachin State in the north, the price of rice was up as much as 35%, while prices of cooking oil and pulses were sharply higher in parts of Rakhine State in the west, the WFP said in a statement.
The cost of fuel had risen by 15% nationwide since Feb. 1, raising concern about further food price increases, it said.
""These rising food and fuel prices are compounded by the near paralysis of the banking sector, slowdowns in remittances, and widespread limits on cash availability,"" the WFP said.
The agency's country director, Stephen Anderson, said the signs were troubling: ""Coming on top of the COVID-19 pandemic, if these price trends continue they will severely undermine the ability of the poorest and most vulnerable to put enough food on the family table.""
A spokesman for the ruling military council did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment. State media has this week reported farmers expecting good prices for their crops of onions and chickpeas.
The WFP is helping to support more than 360,000 people in Myanmar, most of them displaced by conflict over the past decade.
The agency reiterated a call from the U.N. secretary-general for the will of the Myanmar people expressed in November elections to be respected, Anderson said, adding: ""At WFP we know all too well how hunger can quickly follow when peace and dialogue are sidelined.""
The military defended its coup saying its complaints of fraud in a November election won by Suu Kyi's party had been ignored. The election commission said the vote was fair.
A total of 183 people have been killed by security forces in protests against the coup, a rights monitoring group said.
Myanmar, once Asia's main rice basket, was among the region's poorest countries after the military seized power in a 1962 coup and imposed an autarchic ""way to socialism"".

The economy boomed after the military began to withdraw from politics a decade ago.

Only those aged 18-65 years old will be allowed out of their homes, the Metro Manila Development Authority said in a statement, citing an agreement among mayors.
The Philippines late last year started easing one of the world's longest and strictest lockdowns though a rule that anyone under 15 must stay indoors in Manila remained in place. 
The Southeast Asian country has seen a surge in COVID-19 cases this month, recording the largest daily increase since mid-August on Monday with 5,404 new infections.
Nighttime curfews have been reimposed since Monday for two weeks in Metropolitan Manila, the country's coronavirus hotspot that is home to more than 12 million people.
Additional measures such as liquor bans and localised lockdowns in areas with high infection rates have also been put in place.
The extended age limit comes five months after authorities allowed people from 15 to 65 years of age to go out as part of efforts to revive an economy that suffered the worst slump on record last year.
Facing criticisms about a slow-moving vaccination drive, coronavirus strategy chief Carlito Galvez said more doses should arrive soon.
Nearly 2.4 million doses are expected by early April, comprising 979,200 doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine through the COVAX facility and 1.4 million Sinovac shots including 400,000 donated by China, he said.
Galvez said there was no plan to halt the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine to inoculate healthcare workers, even though several European countries have paused administering it after reports of possible serious side-effects.

The government has also signed an agreement with the Serum Institute of India for 30 million  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) vaccine doses, due to arrive in the third or fourth quarter of the year, said Galvez.

In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, the U.S. president's Indo-Pacific coordinator, Kurt Campbell, said China's ""economic coercion"" of Australia had been raised in every meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials and ""will be underscored in interactions in Anchorage later this week"". 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and State Councillor Wang Yi on March 18 in Alaska, the first high-level in-person contact between the two countries under the Biden administration.
""We have made clear that the U.S. is not prepared to improve relations in a bilateral and separate context at the same time that a close and dear ally is being subjected to a form of economic coercion,"" Campbell told The Sydney Morning Herald in an interview published on Tuesday.
Campbell said Biden had told Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison ""that we stood together on this"" during the meeting of the Quad group of leaders, which also included Japan and India, on Friday.
""We are fully aware of what's going on and we are not prepared to take substantial steps to improve relations until those policies are addressed and a more normal interplay between Canberra and Beijing is established,"" said Campbell.
Tensions between Australia and China have been high for the past year after Canberra called for an international investigation into the source of the COVID-19 pandemic and Beijing responded with trade reprisals on Australian coal, wine, barley, live seafood, beef and timber.

Campbell told the newspaper it was not only Australia that had been a target of ""these undeclared kind of steps"", but also the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan.

The Washington Post, which first reported the story, said a congressional aide saw a printed copy of ""The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion"" at a checkpoint inside the entrance of a congressional office building.
The tract, originally published in the early 20th century, is described by the Anti-Defamation League as ""a classic in paranoid, racist literature.""
The officer is suspended pending an internal investigation.
""We take all allegations of inappropriate behavior seriously. Once this matter was brought to my attention, I immediately ordered the officer to be suspended until the Office of Professional Responsibility can thoroughly investigate,"" said Acting Capitol Police chief Yogananda Pittman in a statement.
Scrutiny on U.S. Capitol Police has been high since Jan. 6, when hundreds of supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the building and overpowered Capitol Police officers in a bid to block the certification of President Joe Biden's victory.

Excessive sand mining on the Yangtze, which provides water for a third of the Chinese population, is believed to be responsible for the abnormally low levels of water during the winter drought season in recent years.
Sand mining in the river and its connecting lakes and tributaries has also affected shipping routes and made it harder for authorities to control summer floods. 
According to a notice issued by the water, public security and transportation ministries on Monday, the ""comprehensive rectification"" of mining activities on the Yangtze will help authorities improve flood control and ensure water supplies.
Local authorities have been ordered to draw up plans to regulate sand mining more effectively, and to ban or restrict operations in sensitive regions. They must also crack down heavily on illegal mining and take action against illegal gangs involved in the business.
However, the notice fell short of an outright ban on the activity, which is a lucrative source of income in a region already hit by a river-wide ban on fishing activities. 
Sand mining is believed to have lowered the bed of the Poyang Lake - a Yangtze river flood outlet and one of the world's largest sources of sand used in construction - by at least 20 metres (60 feet). Large parts of the lake now dry up in the winter season.

The provincial government of Jiangxi, which oversees the lake, also announced plans in January to build a dam on the Poyang to try to better regulate water flows, but experts said it could make the problems worse.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain wants to expand its influence among democratic nations in the Indo-Pacific region while preserving strong ties with the United States, a document laying out the country's post-Brexit foreign policy priorities will say on Tuesday.
Putting Britain at odds with China, the biggest review of British foreign and defence policy since the end of the Cold War three decades ago will set out how Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to be at the forefront of a reinvigorated, rules-based international order based on cooperation and free trade.
Calling the Indo Pacific ""increasingly the geopolitical centre of the world"", the government highlighted a British aircraft carrier deployment to the region and announced a previously postponed visit to India will go ahead in April.
Since completing its exit from the European Union at the end of last year after an acrimonious divorce, Johnson's government has vowed the ""Integrated Review"" will show Britain still had clout on the world stage and define a new era for the country. 
""I am profoundly optimistic about the UK’s place in the world and our ability to seize the opportunities ahead,"" Johnson will say in a statement to parliament.
Britain holds two influential roles this year: hosting the first post-pandemic G7 summit in June, and the COP26 climate conference in November.
But the 100-page document, due at 1130 GMT, will be closely scrutinised for concrete measures showing how the government will deliver on Johnson's rhetoric at a time when the country is struggling to come to terms with the realities of Brexit and has suffered more deaths than its peers from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Relations with China, which is on course to become the world's largest economy, have frayed badly over issues including Beijing's handing of former British colony Hong Kong, increasingly vocal criticism of China state-subsidised industry and security concerns around Chinese investment in Britain.
The Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier's long-planned deployment is expected to raise military tension in the South China Sea. 
A statement previewing Tuesday's report listed ""the importance of our relationship with the U.S."" alongside the defence of democracy and human rights, and safety from terrorism as fundamental components of British policy.

Britain is seeking a trade deal with the United States and reassurance over where it sits in President Joe Biden international priorities.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan used tear gas on Monday to suppress protests against a curfew imposed to stem a severe outbreak of COVID-19, witnesses and residents said.
Police took action after hundreds of protesters in several cities including Amman demonstrated for a second day and defied a night curfew which was extended last week, they said.
Many of the protesters called on the government to resign and demanded an end to emergency laws in place since the outset of the pandemic, which civic groups say violate civil and political rights.
Others were angry after nine people, mostly COVID-19 patients, died on Saturday when medics in a government hospital allegedly ignored depleted oxygen supplies on respirators for at least two hours.
Authorities deployed several thousand anti-riot police to disperse protesters as dozens of activists were rounded up in several cities and towns, witnesses said.
Tear gas was used to disperse crowds in several cities including the teeming Jabal Nazal neighbourhood of the capital, a resident said. 
The authorities blocked certain Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) applications that allow live broadcasting from demonstrations, users and sources within the telecommunications sector told Reuters. The outage lasted several hours.
There was no immediate comment from the government.
The curfew has been extended several times since it was imposed a year ago, most recently on Saturday amid a surge in COVID-19 infections.
Jordan reported 9,417 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours, officials said on Monday, its highest one-day tally since the pandemic began. The country of 10 million people has recorded 5,428 deaths from the virus.
Jordan's King Abdullah said in comments broadcast on state media he understood that people were frustrated over worsening living conditions. Jordan last year suffered its worst recession in decades as a result of the pandemic.
But he warned his countrymen not to be swayed by dissidents, saying they sought ""to sow internal strife"".
Anger with the authorities over worsening living standards and corruption has in the past triggered major civil unrest in Jordan.
Many of the protesters were a mix of the country's traditional Herak opposition who demand radical political change and self-employed wage-earners hurt by the shutdowns.

NOKDO, South Korea (Reuters) - At 10 years old, Lyoo Chan-hee wishes he wasn't one of the last three schoolkids left playing on the beaches of Nokdo island.
    ""It would be great if I have more friends here because I can have more options to play,"" said Chan-hee. Instead, he often plays with Kim Si-young - aged 66, and one of the last 100 or so residents of a once-vibrant fishing village emblematic of the demographic crisis unfolding in South Korea.
""He (Kim) always calls me and shares whenever he is having something delicious,"" Chan-hee told Reuters on a wind-blown day earlier this month as the pair shared grilled oysters.
""That's no lie,"" said Kim. ""I also play ball and badminton with Chan-hee. I always lose though.""
Away from the beach and Chan-hee, Kim leafed through a photo album showing a sun-splashed school sports day - images of hundreds of people toasting children with rice wine that brought tears to his eyes. The prints are 40 years old and fading, just like the prospects for Nokdo, about a 75-minute ferry ride off South Korea's west coast.
After decades of national urbanisation, and a long-gone birth control drive, Nokdo's school is long shut. ""I cried so much (when the island school closed in 2006),"" said Kim.
""I want to protect Nokdo but it's depressing to see fewer and fewer people here.""
Nokdo's decline encapsulates the demographic slump in Asia's fourth largest economy. It has become the world's fastest-ageing society with the lowest birth rate anywhere in 2020, according to the World Bank. 
""So many little towns are at risk of disappearing,"" said demographics researcher Choi One-lack at the Korea Economic Research Institute (KERI). ""The pace of ageing and birth declines is the worst here among the OECD."" 
FAMILY PLANNING
The nation's fertility rate slid to just 0.84 in 2020 from 4.5 in 1970, Statistics Korea data showed. Amid the nation's economic rise since the 1970s, producing world-class manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and Hyundai Motor, more women began to enter the workforce as family planning campaigns, including sterilisation, took effect in the 1970s and 1980s. ""When we went for (national service) military training some of us used to undergo vasectomy to curb population growth,"" said Nokdo's Kim. ""Some got their wives to get it done."" 
More recently, soaring home prices in Seoul metropolitan area, where almost half of the nation's 51 million population now live, have been blamed for fewer babies in the country, while last year the coronavirus pandemic also discouraged couples from marrying and having babies. The Bank of Korea expects the nation will overtake Japan as the oldest society in the world sooner than 2045 - its earlier projection - as its ""fertility rate is declining at a much faster pace than expected"" amid the pandemic, the bank said in a December report. 
Some predict serious labour shortage problems.
""Losing workforce will be a bigger hit for countries like South Korea, than say Australia or other resource-rich nations, because the very backbone of the growth engine here has been manpower and technologies,"" said KERI's Choi.
To replenish the workforce, the government plans to encourage more women and senior citizens to work, and create new visas to attract foreign professionals. 
'HEAVENLY PLACE'
Back in Nokdo, Chan-hee's father Lyoo Geun-pil, 42, is one of the island's younger residents, working as a pastor at the island's only church since 2016. 
Lyoo described Nokdo as a ""heavenly place"" as his three children can run around freely, worrying only about where to find wild goats or gulls to chase, rather than look out for traffic. 
He plans to stay in Nokdo as long as his pastoral position allows him to, but knows the family can't stay here forever, not least because learning facilities are restricted to a single makeshift mini-classrom and a teacher dispatched from the mainland.
""I'm also worried this place might disappear soon,"" he said, expressing the sense of foreboding that's troubling hundreds of rural towns all across South Korea.
""My first one (Chan-hee) needs to go to a middle school in two years ... I want to give some hope (to folks on the island) by finding a way to give middle school education to Chan-hee from here,"" Lyoo said.
For Chan-hee, Nokdo is the place to be, even without extra friends.
""Seoul is so crowded, noisy and the air is not good,"" said Chan-hee. ""Nokdo has no traffic, isn't noisy and the air is clean. I can play outside more actively, so I like it here.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Further cuts in aid to Afghanistan by the United States and other donors could cause the government to collapse and return the country to chaos similar to the 1990s, a U.S. government watchdog said on Monday. 
The warning by John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, came as the United States, Russia and other countries strive to kickstart stalled Afghan peace talks and President Joe Biden faces a May 1 deadline for withdrawing all remaining U.S. troops.
“Eighty percent of Afghanistan’s budget is funded by the U.S. and the (other international) donors,” Sopko said in a Reuters interview. “If, for whatever reason, the donors keep drawing down funding ... that could bring the sudden demise of the Afghan government as we know it.”
He warned of “history repeating itself,” referring to the anarchy that convulsed Afghanistan after the Soviet Union ended its 1979-89 occupation and cut its assistance to the Kabul government.
The chaos paved the way for the Taliban’s takeover. The group provided Osama bin Laden with the sanctuary in which al Qaeda planned the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The subsequent U.S. invasion of Afghanistan ended Taliban rule.
International annual development aid to Afghanistan has decreased from a high of $6.7 billion in 2011, hitting $4.2 billion in 2019, according to World Bank data.
Sopko testifies on Tuesday before the House of Representatives Oversight and Reform Committee on his latest report.
The report noted that donors at a November conference pledged at least $3.3 billion in civilian assistance for a year. If their annual commitments remain at that level until 2024, funding would be 15% below 2016 pledges, it said.
The United States, which steadily has been reducing aid for Afghanistan, pledged as much as $600 million for a year, but made half contingent on progress in the peace talks between the Taliban and a delegation that includes government officials.
If the funding disappears, Sopko said the Afghan government would be hard-pressed to fight on and succeed against the Taliban and other extremists in the absence of a peace deal.
If a peace pact is reached, he noted that the World Bank found the country would need a further $5.2 billion in civilian aidthrough 2024 to sustain peace.
“Even the Taliban recognizes they really need foreign support,” he said. “Without it, the government falls.""

Pazuello's job is on the line after the most deadly week in Brazil since the coronavirus pandemic began. More than 279,000 Brazilians have died in a worsening outbreak that killed more people in Brazil than any other nation last week.
""The President is thinking of a replacement in the ministry and is evaluating names,"" Pazuello told reporters in a news conference. He said he would not resign and that the change could come ""in the short-, medium- or long-term.""
Pazuello, an active duty Army general without a medical degree, has been criticized for lacking public health expertise and supporting Bolsonaro's push to use unproven drugs to fight COVID-19, while downplaying the need for social distancing.
Pazuello's two predecessors resigned in roughly the span of a month last year, in part because as physicians they would not fully endorse treating COVID-19 patients with the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. 
Pazuello expanded access to hydroxychloroquine, which is unproven as a COVID-19 treatment, and allowed it to be prescribed to virtually anyone testing positive for the novel coronavirus.
His failure to secure timely supplies of vaccines for the country has led to calls for an inquiry in Congress, while the Supreme Court is investigating his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the northern city of Manaus, which ran out of oxygen.
Bolsonaro met on Sunday with Ludhmila Hajjar, a doctor who has been at the forefront of COVID-19 treatment and research in Brazil, but disagreed on how to approach the crisis.
Hajjar told CNN Brasil that she declined the job, saying that as a doctor she had to ""remain above ideology.""
Hajjar has publicly criticized the government's COVID-19 strategy and contradicted the far-right president's insistence on the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus patients.
Brazil has vaccinated too few people and the result has been ""catastrophic,"" Hajjar, a cardiologist, said in a recent interview.

""Brazil is doing everything wrong in this pandemic and it is now paying the price,"" she told Sao Paulo newspaper Opçao.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea so far has rebuffed entreaties from the United States to engage in dialogue, the White House said on Monday, as a chill in relations that began under then-President Donald Trump has extended into Joe Biden's presidency.
Nuclear-armed North Korea gave up on diplomacy with Trump even though he and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had three high-profile summit meetings and exchanged a series of letters.
Trump had refused North Korean entreaties to relax sanctions against Pyongyang unless Kim took steps to dismantle his nuclear program, which he refused to do.
Biden White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that U.S. officials have reached out to North Korea through a number of channels since taking office nearly two months ago.
""Our goal is to reduce the risk of escalation. But to date we have not received any response,"" Psaki said.
She did not elaborate on what type of escalation the United States was concerned about. North Korea conducted six nuclear tests between 2006 and 2017.
Psaki said the administration was consulting former U.S. government officials who have been involved in North Korea policy from past administrations while also seeking input from allies Japan and South Korea.
""This follows over a year without active dialogue with North Korea despite multiple attempts by the U.S. to engage...You can all anticipate that there will be a continued expansion of engagement with partners and allies in the region,"" she said.
A senior Biden administration official told Reuters on Saturday there had been efforts to reach out to the North Korean government through several channels starting in mid-February.

The Pentagon expressed concern early this month about a U.N. report indicating possible reprocessing of nuclear fuel for bombs by North Korea.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden sounded doubtful on Monday about former President Donald Trump playing a role in helping to persuade hesitant Republicans to get coronavirus vaccine shots.
Biden and his team have been trying to figure out how to vaccinate more Republicans as polls show some supporters of the former president have not wholeheartedly accepted the idea of getting vaccine shots.
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Biden said he had discussed the issue with his advisers.
""I discussed it with my team and they say the thing that has more impact than anything Trump would say to the MAGA folks is what the local doctor, what the local preacher, what the local people in the community say,"" Biden said.
MAGA is the acronym for Trump's signature slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""
Trump has said little to his supporters about getting vaccinated, after quietly getting the vaccine himself in January. ""Everybody, go get your shot,"" he told the Conservative Political Action Conference late last month in Florida.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Trump could help but did not necessarily expect him to do so.
""If former President Trump woke up tomorrow and wanted to be more vocal about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, certainly we'd support that,"" Psaki said. 
Health officials are contacting evangelicals and other conservatives to reach Republicans, she told reporters at her daily briefing.
""The president’s goal is to vaccinate all Americans, not just those who voted for him,"" Psaki said. ""We know that we need to meet everyone where they are, and that includes conservatives, and ensure there are trusted messengers who lead the way in those engagements.""
In a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll released last week, about half of U.S. men who identified themselves as Republicans said they had no plans to get the vaccine.
Eighty-one percent of Republicans said they would trust their own doctor’s advice on a COVID-19 vaccine, Psaki said Monday, and that's one area where the White House is concentrating. 
The other living former U.S. presidents - Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter - are set to appear in two public service announcements for the coronavirus vaccine alongside their wives, without Trump.

Other presidents ""have participated in public campaigns"" on the vaccine, Psaki said Monday. ""They did not need an engraved invitation to do so,"" she added.

578,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 06:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mexico focuses vaccine loan request on U.S. stockpile of AstraZeneca doses,"By Adriana Barrera and Frank Jack Daniel
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has asked the United States to share doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine it has in stock, a senior diplomat said, following up on a request made by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to his counterpart Joe Biden. 
Deputy foreign minister for multilateral affairs Martha Delgado said that since the United States had not yet approved the AstraZeneca vaccine it would be a good candidate to offer to Mexico, which has started using it already. 
""The possibility exists of being able to have access to some AstraZeneca batches they have,"" Delgado said in an interview with Reuters late last week, saying Mexico had made the request in diplomatic conversations since Lopez Obrador spoke to Biden on March 1.
""That vaccine is already authorized in Mexico, but doesn't have authorization at the moment in the United States,"" she said. ""They could release it.""
Lopez Obrador asked Biden for a vaccine ""loan"" during the virtual meeting, after Mexico's vaccine strategy was knocked off course by a delay in deliveries of the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). 
Delgado, who leads Mexico's diplomatic effort to get vaccine supplies, said the United States had not said whether it would meet the request for AstraZeneca and other vaccines, which she said included those from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc. The Novavax shot also is not yet authorized in the United States.
A U.S. official, who asked not to be named, said the United States had not agreed to loans or distributions of AstraZeneca vaccines at this time. The person said the United States was not currently in a position to share doses but had already committed to doing so once the supply issue is dealt with domestically.
The U.S. State Department referred inquiries to the Mexican government and vaccine companies. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A top U.S. health official told Reuters on Monday that AstraZeneca's vaccine could be authorized by U.S. regulators in about a month. 
The request for AstraZeneca doses is notable because the British-developed drug is the backbone of Mexico's vaccine strategy, under a shared production deal with Argentina in which Mexico is due to bottle the doses for Latin America.
'MEXICO WILL NEVER FORGET' 
Delays in the Mexican regulatory process mean the first doses will now not be shipped until the first week of May, Delgado said. Originally, the hope was for production by March, which had already slipped into April.
Delgado said Mexican diplomats also had to overcome delays in delivery of laboratory filters essential for vaccine production from U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co. That situation has not affected the production timeline, she said. 
Under the deal with Argentina, the vaccine is produced in bulk in the South American country and shipped to Mexico for bottling. Two shipments of 6 million doses each were sent in January and early February. 
Last month, Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that delays at the Mexican laboratory, Liomont, led the Argentine manufacturer to divert the equivalent of 12.8 million doses of vaccine material to a U.S. AstraZeneca bottler. 
Delgado said she was not aware of such a diversion, adding that a new shipment from Argentina was due to arrive in Mexico ""very soon."" 
A senior Argentine government official denied vaccine material was sent to the United States. 
""There is no plan of sending them to other places. What did happen is that the U.S. was not exporting some goods that the Mexican lab needed to finish the process,"" the official said, requesting anonymity to speak freely. 
The delays in U.S. and European vaccines have pushed Mexico toward deals with Russia and China.

ROME (Reuters) - Steve Bannon, the former adviser to ex-U.S. President Donald Trump, has lost a legal battle to set up a right-wing Catholic political academy in an abbey in Italy.
The Council of State on Monday ruled against the Dignitatis Humanae Institute (DHI), backed by Bannon, which wanted to start the school in an 800-year-old monastery south of Rome.
The case has been in the Italian court system for years, with suits and counter-suits between the DHI on one side and the culture ministry, which owns the property on the other, along with a group of local environmental and civic organisations.
Bannon, a Catholic, was helping to craft the curriculum for leadership courses aimed at right-wing Catholic activists at what was to be the Academy for the Judeo-Christian West in the town of Trisulti.
Bannon in a statement on Monday vowed to fight the decision.
""We intend to appeal and win,"" he said. ""Trisulti is an Italian treasure and we will fight for it.”
Many residents opposed the school. In 2019, the ministry withdrew a 19-year lease, citing violations of contractual obligations. The institute appealed to the regional tribunal saying the move was politically motivated and won the appeal last year.
The institute’s founder, Benjamin Harnwell, confirmed Monday's decision against the DHI in a telephone call with Reuters but said he had no immediate further comment. He said lawyers were still studying the ruling.
During the Trump administration, the project for the institute found support among Italy's populist right-wing politicians, such as former interior minister Matteo Salvini.
Over the years the project lost support of key Roman Catholic conservatives, including American Cardinal Raymond Burke, who for years strongly backed Bannon and was a honorary president of the institute.
Burke yanked his support after Bannon said he wanted to make a film from a book alleging homosexuality in Vatican.
Days before leaving office in January, Trump granted clemency to Bannon, a key adviser in his 2016 presidential run.

Bannon was charged last year with swindling the president’s supporters over an effort to raise private funds to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. He pleaded not guilty.

Everard, 33, was abducted as she walked home in south London on March 3 and a police officer has been charged with her kidnap and murder, provoking a national debate over how British society deals with male violence against women.
Protesters gathered outside parliament in Westminster, where lawmakers started debating a bill on Monday that opponents said would give police too much power to restrict peaceful protests, days after police were criticised for using excessive force at a vigil for Everard.
The protesters briefly blocked traffic on nearby Westminster Bridge before gathering outside New Scotland Yard, the headquarters of London's Metropolitan Police, and moving on to Johnson's Downing Street office.
Holding signs reading ""Educate your sons"" and ""End violence against women"", protesters stood opposite a line of police outside New Scotland Yard, chanting ""Sisters united will never be defeated"" and ""Who protects us from you?""
Political focus has shifted onto London's Metropolitan Police after officers tried to disperse a vigil for Everard on Saturday, saying it breached COVID-19 lockdown rules. They scuffled with mourners and dragged women away in handcuffs.
Monday's protest proceeded for several hours without the same heavy-handed police tactics, following widespread criticism of Saturday's events and calls for the Met's chief to resign. 

""They came with flowers, you came with force,"" read one protester's sign.

Kevin McCarthy, the House of Representatives minority leader, visited border facilities in El Paso, Texas, with a dozen fellow Republicans to blame Biden for the suffering of migrants arriving at the border and to warn about potential health and security risks to the United States.
Biden's efforts to reverse some of former President Donald Trump's restrictive border policies have been accompanied by an upswing in border arrivals. As of Friday, the Department of Health and Human Services' refugee office had about 8,800 unaccompanied children in custody.
Republicans in both the House and Senate say the Biden administration sparked the surge by promising to unwind Trump policies. They turned to the border security issue, which strongly appeals to their base supporters, as Democrats talked up Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief measure, which passed Congress without a single Republican vote.
""I came down here because I heard of the crisis. It's more than a crisis. This is a human heartbreak,"" McCarthy said from a podium set up on the sandy Texan terrain days before the House is due to take up immigration reform legislation. 
""It didn't have to happen. This crisis is created by the presidential policies of this new administration.""
Even before he began speaking, McCarthy had been pre-empted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who targeted the California Republican as part of a new Democratic messaging campaign aimed at promoting the benefits of the COVID-19 legislation. 
""McCarthy is desperately trying to distract Americans from the fact that every single House Republican voted to block a relief bill that delivers vaccines in arms, money in pockets, children back in school safely and people back in jobs,"" Pelosi's office said in a statement highlighting media reports about $1,400 stimulus checks and canceled job furloughs in his district. 
Democratic Representative Veronica Escobar, whose district includes El Paso, said McCarthy and his colleagues used the border as a political prop to deliver a dated, xenophobic message about immigrants.
""We saw my Republican colleagues stoke fear and anger toward immigrants, fueling that xenophobia. You know, the whole immigrants-bringing-diseases-into-our-country kind of thing,” she told an online news conference.
""They said that we should do nothing,"" Escobar added. ""That was their approach, we know, toward COVID … and they're now advocating the same approach toward immigration.""
The White House also pushed back on Republican charges that Biden was not taking the border issue seriously and laid the blame for the current surge at the feet of Trump. 

""We recognize this is a big problem. The last administration left us a dismantled and unworkable system. And like any other problem, we are going to do everything we can to solve it,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.

In a separate press conference, Norwegian Health Minister Bent Hoeie announced that the government is introducing stricter measures for 52 municipalities surrounding the capital region, including the closure of non-essential shops and in-restaurant dining, although schools will remain open. 
The government said last week that tougher national restrictions could be imposed unless local authorities managed to curb the COVID-19 outbreak.
The Nordic country has maintained one of Europe's lowest rates of infection but now faces a third wave of the disease.
""There is no doubt now that we are in a third wave,"" said Oslo Governing Mayor Raymond Johansen, adding the reproduction rate, which measures the number of people infected by each positive case, had risen to 1.5 in Oslo.
""These measures are on top of all the existing ones and, in summary, will be the most invasive measures introduced in Oslo since the start of the pandemic,"" he told a news conference. 
Kindergartens and elementary schools remain open, but areas of the capital where infections are highest will switch to digital learning for older children attending elementary schools.
In the capital, where the more contagious variant first identified in Britain as B.1.1.7 dominates, local authorities have closed non-essential stores and some schools, and limited restaurants to providing takeaway food. 
Most new infections occur among children, authorities have said. 
During the first lockdown that began in March last year, schools and nurseries closed along with many services such as hair salons, but shops and restaurants remained open.

As of March 14, the nation of 5.4 million had vaccinated almost 448,000 people with a first dose, and more than 256,000 had also received a second dose, data from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health showed.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A United Nations body working to ensure justice for war crimes committed by all sides in Syria has provided information and evidence to 12 national jurisdictions, its chief disclosed on Monday as the country marked a decade of war.
Videos, photos, satellite imagery, ""exfiltrated documents"", witness statements and forensic samples constitute ""the best documented situation since the end of World War Two"", said Catherine Marchi-Uhel of the International Impartial and Independent Mechanism investigating the most serious crimes in Syria. 
""It doesn't make the justice path easy, but it makes it possible,"" Marchi-Uhel , a former French judge, told a panel event hosted by Britain. 
Her small team in Geneva is building a repository of the large amount of evidence and information and corroborated it in accordance with international criminal law standards, she said.
""We are cooperating with and assisting investigations and prosecutions in 12 different jurisdictions. We have received 100 requests for assistance in relation to 84 distinct investigations and prosecutions,"" Marchi-Uhel said. It had shared information and evidence for 39 of the 100 investigations.
Marchi-Uhel, referring to the 12 jurisdictions, later told Reuters: ""A large proportion are in Europe"".
A court in the German city of Koblenz last month sentenced a former member of Syrian President Assad's security services to 4-1/2 years in prison for abetting the torture of civilians, the first such verdict for crimes against humanity in the Syrian civil war. 
Paulo Pinheiro, who heads a separate panel of U.N. war crimes investigators that keeps a confidential list of suspects, told Monday's event: ""To date, the Commission of Inquiry has compiled initial information on more than 3,200 alleged individual perpetrators. 
""That includes individuals from all sides of the conflict, including government and pro-government forces, anti-government armed groups, and United Nations-listed terrorist organisations, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and ISIL,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York communications consultant who lost her job during the pandemic has used her free time to help people secure COVID-19 vaccine appointments.
Carrie Driscoll's efforts started when her mother in Florida struggled to sign up for her appointment. So 42-year-old Driscoll put her research skills to work from her apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea.
She spent a week familiarizing herself with the appointment sites, focusing on the fastest way to book an appointment when slots became available.
""A lot of the fields that you enter are not required so you can skip them and finish a lot faster than other people and get that appointment,"" she said. After helping her mother and her network of friends she began branching out. ""I saw a news story about a gentleman who needed help. And I thought, why not?'""
The beneficiaries of her vaccine activism include New Yorkers over 100 years old, those who recently had surgery and Haitian migrants who struggle with the English language, she said.
Marie Deolall, a 52-year-old home health aide in New York, said she had been unable to find an appointment. After Driscoll saw Deolall appear on a local news channel, Driscoll called her up, said Deolall.
""She took my name, my age, and then, boom, everything was settled. I was very, very happy.""

Around 37 million people, or 11% of the population, had been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus as of Sunday in the United States, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden said on Monday he intends to nominate Todd Kim, former solicitor general for the District of Columbia, to lead the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division as its assistant attorney general.
If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Kim would become the department's top attorney overseeing its criminal and civil cases to enforce the nation's environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
The position was held during the Trump administration by Jeffrey Bossert Clark, an attorney who once represented oil company BP (NYSE:BP) Plc in the aftermath of the company's 2010 drilling rig explosion.
Clark is now at the heart of a probe by the department's inspector general over whether he improperly sought to alter the 2020 election results by plotting with former President Donald Trump in a failed attempt to oust then-acting Attorney General Jeff Rosen so that he could launch an investigation of alleged voter fraud in Georgia.
Kim will likely face pressure from progressives to step up the Justice Department's enforcement of environmental laws, an area that activists say was lax during the Trump administration.
He previously worked as an appellate attorney within the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division and has also been a partner with the law firm Reed Smith LLP.
Kim recently started working as deputy general counsel for litigation, regulation and enforcement at the U.S. Department of Energy, and he is now the fifth person nominated by Biden to serve in a top role at the Justice Department.
Attorney General Merrick Garland was sworn into his new post last Thursday, while the Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote soon on the nominations of Lisa Monaco to serve as deputy attorney general and Vanita Gupta as associate attorney general, the No. 2 and No. 3 jobs, respectively.
Kristen Clarke, Biden's pick to lead the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, has yet to have her confirmation hearing.

Biden has not yet nominated people to other top Justice Department posts, such as solicitor general or the heads of the criminal and civil divisions.

Cyprus' inoculation programme with vaccines from Pfizer/BioNtech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) will continue, the health ministry said. There have been no publicly reported cases of any side effects from the AstraZeneca vaccine in Cyprus.
Norway and Denmark stopped giving AstraZeneca shots last week after reporting isolated cases of bleeding, blood clots and a low platelet count. Iceland and Bulgaria followed suit and Ireland and the Netherlands announced suspensions on Sunday.
Spain will stop administering the vaccine for at least 15 days, Cadena Ser radio reported, citing unnamed sources. 

The top WHO scientist reiterated on Monday that there have been no documented deaths linked to any COVID-19 vaccines.

588,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 04:10PM ET</span>",Immigration raids sweep Mexico as Central American exit grows under Biden,"By Lizbeth Diaz and Laura Gottesdiener
APIZACO, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexico has stepped up immigration raids -- hauling hundreds of people off trains in recent weeks -- to stem an increase in Central American migrants heading for the United States since President Joe Biden took office, according to advocates and data from immigration authorities.
    The crackdown by immigration agents backed by the military and police marks an escalation of Mexico's efforts to control migration across its territory.
While Mexico has welcomed Biden's pledge to tackle the root causes of migration from Central America, it is concerned that the new administration's efforts to make it easier for people to claim asylum in the United States is encouraging migration and putting a burden on Mexico.   
    Some 1,200 migrants from Central America - including more than 300 children - were swept up in raids between Jan. 25 and Feb. 16 along train routes in six southern and central Mexican states, as well as in the capital, Mexico's immigration agency said in a statement.
    More than 800 migrants were also detained while traveling northward in buses or tractor trailers in recent weeks, according to figures from immigration authorities tallied by Reuters. 
    Mexico's National Migration Institute said the decision to launch the train raids was not at the behest of the United States and it had not made such detentions in recent years because fewer migrants had used trains previously to travel northwards. 
It did not provide comparative data for the total number of migrants swept up in raids in previous years. 
But Tonatiuh Guillen, the head of Mexico's immigration agency until 2019, told Reuters the frequency and scale of the current detentions were unprecedented. Guillen said that previously raids had been occasional but now they were common practice.
The White House has said the administration has not discussed with Mexico how it deploys security forces on its own soil. The administration has talked with Mexico about management of its southern border with Central America, a U.S. official said. 
""It’s not a question of lists of demands or asking people to do more,"" the official said. ""It's really much more of a question of sitting down and figuring out 'What can we do?'” 
Biden took office in January pledging to undo many of the restrictive immigration policies of former President Donald Trump. He has begun allowing unaccompanied minors arriving at the border to enter the country to pursue asylum claims. They had previously been rapidly deported.
Biden also rolled back a Trump-era program that had forced mostly Central American asylum seekers to wait in Mexico rather than in the United States while their claims are processed.
Republicans say the moves by Biden, a Democrat, have encouraged illegal immigration.
TRAIN HALTED
One evening in late January, a northbound freight train unexpectedly screeched to a halt in the central Mexican town of Apizaco. 
    Dozens of police, security forces and immigration officers swarmed the railroad tracks, according to witnesses. Buses to transport captured migrants were parked nearby.
    Frightened, Honduran migrant Alejandro - who asked not to use his last name for his safety - said he jumped off the top of the train and scurried to take cover in the tall grass. He injured his leg and arm.
    ""I hid there nearly until morning because I heard so much screaming,"" said Alejandro, 28, who swore to avoid using trains henceforth on his journey northward.
    More than 100 migrants were captured in the operation, said Elias Espinoza, director of the Sagrada Familia migrant shelter near where the raid occurred.
It was the largest raid he had seen in eight years at the facility. It was followed about a week later by a second operation there by immigration authorities backed by special forces, Espinoza said. 
Migrants run the risk of detention and deportation if they do not have the proper documentation to be in Mexico, even if they plan to seek asylum at the U.S. border.
""Mexico is playing the role of stopping immigration to the United States,"" said Sergio Martin, head of operations in Mexico for humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders.
Human rights groups have raised concerns about increased enforcement activities, saying Mexican and Central American security forces often infringe migrants' right to seek asylum. 
Despite the Mexico raids, U.S. border agents conducted 100,441 apprehensions or expulsions of migrants at the Mexican border in February, the highest monthly total since a border crisis of 2019. The rise was driven by migrants from Central America. 
Asked about the raids and whether the U.S. administration supports Mexico stemming migration flows, a State Department spokeswoman said the United States works to promote ""safe, orderly, fair, and humane migration globally."" 
    Mexico's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to questions. It has said orderly migration is in the national interest and it has told the new U.S. administration that it will maintain enforcement efforts aimed to control illegal immigration. 
Central American migrants are fleeing criminal violence, economic collapse and a growing hunger crisis, exacerbated by devastating storms. 
Pandemic-related lockdowns and back-to-back hurricanes in November have devastated fragile Central American economies, particularly that of Honduras.
Fewer Central American migrants can now pay smugglers to spirit them across Mexico and into the United States, a trip that costs thousands of dollars per person.
    Instead, more migrants are making their way on their own, smugglers say, exposing them to both powerful drug cartels and the immigration raids.
   Some migrants are opting to trek hundreds of miles through harsh terrain, rather than risk being swept up in raids.
    Honduran migrant Pablo Sordo, in the Mexican state of Veracruz, said he had already been stopped once by Mexican authorities at a checkpoint and that he did not intend to board the train out of fear that he would be stopped again. 

    ""You have to travel undetected: otherwise you'll either run into immigration or you'll run into thugs, and if you don't have money to pay they'll leave you barefoot,"" Sordo said.

Perez alleges that the February vote - in which he placed third behind leftist economist Andres Arauz and conservative banker Guillermo Lasso - was marred by fraud. He had lagged Lasso by a narrow margin, according to official results.
""We will remain firm in our vision of resistance, and we will establish other mechanisms of struggle to bring forward the country's popular and social demands,"" Ecuador's CONAIE indigenous grouping said in a statement. 
The move could complicate efforts by Arauz, an ally of former president Rafael Correa, and Lasso to win support from the Andean country's indigenous voters.
If the number of spoilt, or invalidated, ballots exceeds the total number of votes received by the two candidates in the runoff, the whole election is declared null and void under Ecuadorean law.
Perez had asked an electoral court to recount some 20,000 vote tally sheets that he said contained inconsistencies. The court declined his request, arguing it lacked a legal basis.
Official results from the first round showed Arauz won 32.7% of the vote, while Lasso received 19.74% and Perez lagged just behind, on 19.39%. Some 10% of votes cast were declared invalid.
Enrique Pita, vice president of the National Electoral Council, told reporters he did not think the move by Pachakutik, the political arm of CONAIE, would impact the vote. 

Indigenous groups in 2019 led mass protests against President Lenin Moreno's market-friendly reforms.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Icelanders are yearning for some undisturbed shut-eye after tremors from tens of thousands of earthquakes have rattled their sleep for weeks in what scientists call an unprecedented seismic event, which might well end in a spectacular volcanic eruption.
""At the moment we're feeling it constantly. It's like you're walking over a fragile suspension bridge,"" Rannveig Gudmundsdottir, a lifelong resident in the town of Grindavik, told Reuters. 
Grindavik lies in the southern part of the Reykjanes Peninsula, a volcanic and seismic hot spot, where more than 40,000 earthquakes have occurred since Feb. 24, exceeding the total number of earthquakes registered there last year. 
Located between the Eurasian and the North American tectonic plates, Iceland frequently experiences earthquakes as the plates slowly drift in opposite directions at a pace of around 2 centimetres each year.
The source of the past weeks' earthquakes is a large body of molten rock, known as magma, moving roughly one kilometre (0.6 mile) beneath the peninsula, as it tries to push its way to the surface. 
""We've never seen so much seismic activity,"" Sara Barsotti, volcanic hazards coordinator at the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) told Reuters. 
Some of those quakes clocked in at magnitudes as high as 5.7. 
""Everyone here is so tired,"" Gudmundsdottir, a 5th grade school teacher, said. ""When I go to bed at night, all I think about is: Am I going to get any sleep tonight?"". 
Many in Grindavik have visited relatives, spent time in summer houses, or even rented a hotel room in Reykjavik, the capital, just to get a break and a good night's sleep.
Authorities in Iceland warned of an imminent volcanic eruption on the peninsula in early March, but said they did not expect it to disturb international air traffic or damage critical infrastructure nearby. 
Unlike the eruption in 2010 of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, which halted approximately 900,000 flights and forced hundreds of Icelanders from their homes, the eruption on the peninsula is not expected to spew much ash or smoke into the atmosphere. 
Experts are expecting lava to erupt from fissures in the ground, possibly resulting in spectacular lava fountains, which could extend 20 to 100 metres in the air. 
Already last year authorities put an emergency plan in place for Grindavik. One option includes putting locals on boats in the North Atlantic, if an eruption shuts roads to the remote town.

""I trust the authorities to keep us informed and evacuate us,"" Gudmundsdottir said. ""I'm not scared, just tired.""

PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haitians used flaming tires, trucks and debris to barricade some of Port-au-Prince's main roads on Monday to protest the insecurity wracking the country in the wake of the deaths of police officers in a botched raid on a gang stronghold.
Kidnappings and murders in the poorest country in the Americas have surged over the past year as gangs have gained power amid a deepening economic and political crisis, even creating a broad federation of gangs. 
At least four police officers were killed and eight injured on Friday in an attempted raid on the Village de Dieu slum in the capital, where kidnapping victims are often kept and which has become a no-go area in recent years, authorities said. 
Videos circulating on social media showed gang members dragging and beating the bodies of SWAT officers, brandishing the heavy weapons, ammunition and armored vehicles they commandeered from them.
President Jovenel Moise denounced the acts as ""a declaration of war against society,"" called on security forces to continue working to free Village de Dieu and announced three days of national mourning. 
Human rights activists, though, accuse his government of fostering gang activity. The alleged perpetrators of massacres that have taken place during his administration in opposition strongholds remain free and the cases against them appear to have stalled.
Although the government agreed to raise funding for Haiti's' police force this year, it remains ill equipped and understaffed to face off the gangs that have proliferated in recent years, making swaths of the capital no-go areas. 
Friday's debacle has added more fuel to calls for Moise, who has been ruling by decree since parliament dissolved more than a year ago, to either step down or hold elections immediately, with the new hashtag #FreeHaiti trending in recent days. 
But Moise blames chronic unrest on the opposition and oligarchs who he says want to force him out undemocratically. 
He says he wants to reform the constitution to ensure an end to the political instability that has plagued Haiti since the return of democracy 35 years ago before holding new parliamentary elections.
Critics say he will only amass more power through the reform and appears to be trying to install a dictatorship. They hope the United States, Haiti's main donor, will stop backing Moise under President Joe Biden.
The U.S. administration has started expressing increasing concern over Moise's rule by decree. 

""I share concern about some of the authoritarian and undemocratic actions that we've seen,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a congressional hearing last week, a statement the U.S. embassy in Haiti retweeted on Monday.

The decision by President Joe Biden's administration to send Khalilzad to Moscow signals that the United States and Russia, which both favor the creation of an interim government, may cooperate on ending the strife in Afghanistan despite their deep disagreements on other issues. 
The Moscow conference will ""compliment all other international efforts to support the Afghanistan peace process and also reflects the international community's concerns about progress to date,"" deputy State Department spokeswoman Jalina Porter told a news briefing.
The Taliban and the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani have agreed to attend the conference. China and Pakistan also were invited.
The meeting is one of a series of international gatherings called to try to break an impasse in talks in Doha between the Taliban and a delegation that includes government officials on a political settlement to decades of war.
The United States faces a May 1 deadline to withdraw its remaining troops from Afghanistan under a February 2020 deal with the Taliban reached under former President Donald Trump. U.S. troops have been in Afghanistan since 2001.
The United States this month floated a proposed peace accord that would replace the Ghani administration with an interim government to which the Taliban and the government would name members, and establish a nationwide ceasefire.
Under the plan, presidential and parliamentary elections would be held after the adoption of a new constitution.
Khalilzad shared the proposal with the sides and has been soliciting their views as he shuttles around the region.

Russia also has advocated the establishment of an interim government as part of a peace deal. Ghani has rejected the idea, saying elections should decide a change in government. The Taliban oppose a ceasefire and the holding of elections.

The decision came after the country's recently re-elected President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, a conservative, asked the court to evaluate the legislation on the grounds that it appeared to contain ""excessively undefined concepts"". 
Under the bill approved by parliament in January, people aged over 18 would be allowed to request assistance in dying if they were terminally ill and suffering from ""lasting"" and ""unbearable"" pain - unless they were deemed not to be mentally fit to make such a decision.
Rebelo de Sousa had previously said he would respect the parliament's vote but he still decided to send it to the Constitutional Court for review. 
Judge Pedro Machete told a news conference the law was unconstitutional because some of the clauses posed a threat to the principle of ""inviolability of life"".
Parliament can now review the legislation again in a bid to address the court's concerns and get Rebelo de Sousa's stamp of approval to legalise the practice. 

Portugal, a Catholic-majority country which spent a large part of the 20th century until the 1974 Carnation revolution ruled by a fascist regime, has since implemented many liberal reforms. It legalised abortions in 2007 and allowed same-sex marriage in 2010.

""We decided to continue the current practice in our cities in today's meeting and to closely follow the developments,"" Erdogan told reporters after a Cabinet meeting.
Turkey eased pandemic measures two weeks ago on a province-by-province basis, and said the measures would be evaluated every two weeks.
Provinces are ranked on a scale of low to very high risk based on average daily cases per 100,000 people. Although average daily cases in some provinces have risen above the cut-off for their current risk group, no changes to the provinces' status were announced.
""I think that our people were not able to show the necessary attention to abiding by the rules with the first excitement of normalisation,"" Erdogan said. 
""God willing, by acting much more consciously and carefully from now on, we will overcome this issue all together,"" he added.
Turkey, with a population of 83 million, has administered about 11.5 million vaccine doses in a campaign that began in mid-January. More than 7.93 million people have received a first shot and nearly 3.57 million a second dose of the vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech.

A total of 2,894,893 COVID-19 cases have been recorded since the beginning of the pandemic, the data from the Health Ministry showed on Monday. In the space of 24 hours, 63 people died due to COVID-19, bringing the cumulative death toll to 29,552.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil could begin full production of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc's COVID-19 vaccine by July if regulators allow, an official at biomedical center Fiocruz said, moving up by 100 days the timeline to produce shots without imported ingredients.
Fiocruz Vice President Marco Krieger told Reuters that, if health regulator Anvisa waives some controls, the biomedical institute could move up the Sept. 30 target date for 100% local production of the shot by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.
""This would be important at a time when Brazil is facing vaccine shortages,"" Krieger said in an interview on Friday.
Delays in getting supplies from India and China have slowed Fiocruz's finishing line and Brazil's vaccination program. Only 6% of Brazil's adult population has had their first of two shots.
Federally funded Fiocruz, based in Rio de Janeiro, has delivered 4 million ready-made vaccines from India and is filling and finishing shots with active ingredients from China. Delivery of those doses, starting this week, is expected tototal 100.4 million by July. Fully local production of the vaccine is scheduled for September, when Fiocruz plans to start delivery of 110 million doses for Brazil's immunization program.
Given the urgent need for vaccines in Brazil, which lost more than 12,000 lives to the pandemic last week alone, Krieger said he hoped Anvisa would help to shorten that timeline.
As the vaccine is already in use in Europe and elsewhere, Krieger said Fiocruz may be able to get Anvisa's approval after the regulator supervises production of just one batch, rather than the customary three batches.
Along with the 4 million AstraZeneca doses, Brazil's government has received 20.6 million doses of CoronaVac, made by China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd and bottled by Sao Paulo's Butantan Institute with active ingredients from China.
On Friday, Anvisa granted final approval for AstraZeneca's vaccine. CoronaVac has been approved for emergency use.
Krieger said output from Fiocruz should reach 1 million doses a day by the end of March. By then, Fiocruz will have received another shipment of ingredients from China to make 30 million doses, he said.
Krieger did not address the British vaccine being halted last week in Denmark, Norway and Iceland over bleeding and clotting issues.

AstraZeneca said on Sunday a review of safety data of people vaccinated with its COVID-19 vaccine has shown no evidence of increased risk of blood clots.

The Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board said in a statement it had advised a halt after learning of several cases in Norway and Denmark in which people younger than 65 had developed blood clots or a low blood platelet count after receiving the vaccine.
That ""does not mean that we are bypassing the EMA"", the Board said. ""Our advice was made pending the appraisal by EMA.""
The European Medicines Agency has said there is no indication that cases of blood clotting cases were caused by the vaccination.
It said on Monday its safety committee would meet on March 18 to review evidence, including evidence from Britain, where 11 million people have received the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The Dutch government pause its use of the vaccine on Sunday, hours voting began casting votes in a national election seen as a referendum on the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

The decision meant 43,000 vaccination appointments had to be cancelled at short notice, health authorities said. AstraZeneca's vaccine is set to account for 30% of the Dutch vaccination programme through to mid-April.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican said on Monday that priests cannot bless same-sex unions and that such blessings are not valid, in a ruling that greatly disappointed gay Catholics who had hoped their Church was becoming more welcoming under Pope Francis.
In some countries, such as the United States and Germany, parishes and ministers have begun blessing same-sex unions in lieu of marriage, and there have been calls for bishops to de facto institutionalise these.
But conservatives in the 1.3 billion-member Church have expressed alarm over these practices, particularly those in Germany where at least two bishops, including Cardinal Reinhard Marx of Munich, one of the pope's top advisers, have shown support for some kind of ""pastoral"" blessing.
In response to formal questions from a number of dioceses on whether the practice was allowed, the Vatican's doctrinal office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), issued the ruling: ""Negative"".
Pope Francis approved the response, the CDF said, adding that it was ""not intended to be a form of unjust discrimination, but rather a reminder of the truth of the liturgical rite"" of the sacrament of marriage and the blessing associated with it.
Francis DeBernardo, executive director of the gay Catholics group New Ways Ministry, said ""It is not surprising, but still disappointing, that the Vatican has responded 'no'.""
Marianne Duddy-Burke, executive director of DignityUSA, which also supports gays in the Church, said the denial ""will exacerbate the pain and anger of LGBTQI Catholics and our families"" and hurt ""couples who live deeply loving and committed relationships"".
From the time he was archbishop in his native Argentina, Pope Francis has supported the right of gay couples to have civil legal protections but has always opposed gay marriage.
He also has had meetings with gay couples and in 2013 made the now famous remark ""Who am I to judge"" about gays trying to live by the Church's rules.
The Church teaches that being gay is not inherently sinful but forbids same-sex sexual activity.
The head of the German bishops' conference, Georg Baetzing, said the Church there had reflected ""on the living situation of people today"" in what he called ""successful relationships"" and that the Vatican ruling would be part of future discussions.
""There are no easy answers to such questions,"" he said in a statement.
INDIVIDUAL BLESSINGS
A separate explanatory note from the CDF said that while the blessing of same-sex couples was not licit, the decision ""in no way detracts from the human and Christian consideration in which the Church holds each person"".
It also said that Church could bestow blessings ""to individual persons with homosexual inclinations who manifest the will to live in fidelity to the revealed plans of God as proposed by Church teaching"".
A Pew Research survey last year showed that a majority of Catholics in the United States and Western Europe approved of gay marriage while a majority in Eastern Europe and former Soviet-bloc countries opposed it.
Churches in Africa and Asia also strongly oppose gay marriage. Conservatives have warned that debates on homosexuality have spawned debilitating divisions in other Christian Churches, such as the Anglican communion. 
Last year, the Vatican had to move to clarify comments attributed to Pope Francis on civil union laws in a documentary, saying they were taken out of context and did not signal a change in Church doctrine on gay people or support for same-sex marriage.
The comments attributed to the pope in the film alarmed conservatives and they applauded the Vatican's clarification.

Reporters later discovered that two separate quotes in response to separate questions were spliced to appear as one, deleting the intervening context and questions.

600,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 02:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Ocugen plans to sell 100 million Indian vaccine doses in U.S. in 2021,"By Krishna N. Das
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Ocugen (NASDAQ:OCGN) Inc plans to sell 100 million doses of India's state-backed COVID-19 vaccine in the United States this year, the U.S. firm's chief executive Shankar Musunuri told Reuters on Monday.
Musunuri said Ocugen, a Pennsylvania-based biopharmaceutical firm, was aiming to launch the Indian-developed vaccine in the United States in the second quarter of 2021, initially with imported shots before beginning production there.
The United States has already authorised COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) for emergency use.
India's two-dose COVAXIN has been found to be 81% effective in an interim analysis of late-stage trial data on some 26,000 people in India, its developers Bharat Biotech and the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research said this month.
Bharat Biotech says as many as 40 countries are interested in COVAXIN and it has already sought emergency approvals in Brazil and the Philippines. Cracking the U.S. market would be a significant milestone for the company and India's vaccine industry, which is the world's largest.
Musunuri said Ocugen had held initial talks with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and planned to seek emergency use authorisation in April.
""They're fine with the way the interim analysis is being done,"" Musunuri said, adding that Ocugen had ""a regulatory path"" to take the process forward.
Musunuri said COVAXIN had the potential to work against COVID-19 variants and Ocugen could initially focus on children as it was likely to be safe for those over the age of 12, while shots produced by other drugmakers targeted adults.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine has been authorised for emergency use in the United States for individuals 16 years and older, with the other two given authorisation for emergency use in people 18 years and above.
""Like a polio virus given to babies, this could be safe for all children, high-risk groups, pregnant women and people with comorbidities,"" Musunuri said of COVAXIN.
BOOSTER SHOT
He said Ocugen was expecting more data from Bharat Biotech on COVAXIN, following up on a study by the Indian company in January which showed the shot was likely to be effective against the British strain of the coronavirus.
India's drug regulator approved COVAXIN for emergency use in January for people above 12, saying it could act against the whole body of a virus instead of just its ""spike-protein"" tip, potentially making it more effective in case of mutations.
Musunuri said this could mean it could be used as a booster for people already vaccinated with a first dose of other shots.
He said Bharat Biotech would export ""tens of millions of doses"" to Ocugen, which is also finalising U.S. contract- manufacturers for the product.
Ocugen will have the U.S. rights to the vaccine and will be responsible for its clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialisation there. Bharat Biotech will also transfer its technology, and keep 55% of the profit.
Shares in Ocugen have nearly tripled this year, taking it close to a $2 billion market capitalisation, helped by a spike when Bharat Biotech announced its late-stage trial results.

COVAXIN has been given to more than 2 million prioritised adults in India since the country's vaccination drive began in mid-January. Bharat Biotech says it wants to produce about 700 million doses a year domestically.

601,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 02:32PM ET</span>","Military tightens grip, security forces kill 12 anti-coup protesters as Mynanmar seethes","(Reuters) - Myanmar security forces shot dead 12 people taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations on Monday, local media and witnesses said, and the military junta imposed martial law in parts of the main city Yangon which gave commanders wide powers to stamp out dissent.
Supporters of detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi took to the streets again despite the killing of dozens of protesters on Sunday in the bloodiest day since a military coup on Feb. 1 ignited mass demonstrations nationwide.
Marches took place on Monday in the second city Mandalay and in the central towns of Myingyan and Aunglan, where police opened fire, witnesses and media reported.
""One girl got shot in the head and a boy got shot in the face,"" an 18-year-old protester in Myingyan told Reuters by telephone. ""I'm now hiding.""
The Myanmar Now media outlet reported that 12 people had been killed on Monday across the country, including in Myingyan, Aunglan, and the Yangon district of Hlaingthaya. A journalist in Mandalay said one person was shot dead there after a big protest had passed off peacefully.
The deaths bring the total toll from the protests to about 140, based on a tally by rights group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) and the latest reports.
A junta spokesman did not answer calls requesting comment.
State broadcaster MRTV reported martial law had been imposed in several districts of Yangon, Myanmar's commercial hub and former capital, and Myanmar Now said it had also been imposed in several parts of Mandalay.
The martial law announcement stated that military commanders in Yangon would take over administration of districts, including the courts, MRTV said.
The courts martial had the authority to hand down the death sentence or long prison terms for a range of offences. These included treason and dissent, obstructing the military or civil service, spreading untrue information, and crimes related to unlawful association.
Arson attacks on Sunday against 32 Chinese-invested factories in Hlaingthaya, an industrial suburb, prompted China's strongest comments yet on the turmoil gripping its neighbour, where many people see Beijing as supportive of the coup.
China's Global Times newspaper said the factories were ""vandalised in vicious attacks"" that caused damage worth $37 million and injuries to two Chinese employees. Its embassy urged Myanmar's generals to stop the violence.
""We wish that Myanmar's authorities can take further relevant and effective measures to guarantee the security of the lives and assets of Chinese companies and personnel,"" foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in Beijing.
He did not mention the deaths of the protesters. 
The worst of Sunday's bloodshed took place in Hlaingthaya, where security forces killed at least 42 protesters after the factory attacks, according to a doctor who asked not to be identified. 
At least 16 people were killed in other places, AAPP said, as well as one policeman.
In an apparent bid to suppress news of the turmoil, telecoms service providers were ordered to block all mobile data nationwide, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Telecom Telenor said in a statement ""mobile internet was unavailable"".
The army said it took power after its accusations of fraud in a Nov. 8 election won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) were rejected by the electoral commission. It has promised to hold a new election, but has not set a date.
The military has ruled Myanmar for most of the years since independence from Britain in 1948, and had cracked down hard on previous uprisings before agreeing to the latest attempt at a transition to democracy, now derailed. 
COURT SESSION POSTPONED
Suu Kyi, 75, has been detained since the coup and faces various charges, including illegally importing walkie-talkie radios and infringing coronavirus protocols. Last week, the junta accused her of accepting illegal payments but she has not yet been charged with that.
She was due to face another virtual court hearing on Monday but her lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, told Reuters the session could not go ahead because the internet was down. The next hearing will be on March 24, he said.
Khin Maung Zaw also said authorities had informed him the detained Nobel laureate would only be permitted to be represented by two junior lawyers.
Western countries have called for Suu Kyi's release and condemned the violence and Asian neighbours have offered to help resolve the crisis, but Myanmar has a long record of rejecting outside intervention.
Anti-China sentiment has risen since the coup, fuelled by Beijing's muted criticism of the takeover compared with Western condemnation. But protest leader Thinzar Shunlei Yi said Myanmar people did not hate their Chinese neighbours though their rulers had to understand the outrage felt over their stand.
""Chinese government must stop supporting coup council if they actually care about Sino-Myanmar relations and to protect their businesses,"" she said on Twitter. 
Japan, which has long competed for influence in Myanmar with China, said it was monitoring the situation and considering how to respond in terms of economic cooperation.
Tom Andrews, the United Nations human rights investigator on Myanmar, appealed for U.N. member states to cut the supply of cash and weapons to the military. 

The International Labour Organization said trade unionists have been arrested and harassed in door-to-door searches while others are in hiding. The International Trade Union Confederation reported widespread restrictions on workers' rights since the coup.

602,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 02:30PM ET</span>",Judge in George Floyd police trial calls timing of $27 million settlement unfortunate,"By Jonathan Allen
(Reuters) - The judge in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in the arrest of George Floyd, said on Monday it was unfortunate the city had announced a $27 million settlement with Floyd's family on Friday in the midst of jury selection.
Judge Peter Cahill of the Hennepin County District Court said he would soon recall the seven jurors seated last week to ask whether they had seen news of the settlement and whether it would affect their impartiality.
""I wish city officials would stop talking about this case so much,"" the judge said before resuming jury selection on Monday morning. ""At the same time, I don't find any evil intent that they are trying to tamper with the criminal case.""
The trial in a heavily fortified tower in downtown Minneapolis is being closely watched as a bellwether of the way U.S. law enforcement agencies use force and violence in policing Black people.
Chauvin, who is white, was captured in a bystander's video with his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man in handcuffs, cried out for his life and his mother, who had recently died. The death ignited global protests against racism and police brutality. Chauvin and three other police officers were fired the day after the arrest.
Floyd's family filed a federal wrongful-death lawsuit against Chauvin and the city of Minneapolis last year. The city held a widely viewed news conference with family members on Friday to announce the $27 million settlement, described by Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Floyd's family, as one of the largest-ever settlements of its kind.
Eric Nelson, Chauvin's lead lawyer, said the news was ""profoundly disturbing"" to the defense.
""By my count, this is the third highly prejudicial press leak or press release that has very suspicious timing, to say the least, and has an incredible propensity to taint a jury pool,"" he told the court before jury selection resumed.
Besides asking to recall the seven jurors already seated, Nelson asked the judge to reconsider his request to move the trial to a different county, which Cahill said he would consider.
'ALL OVER THE MEDIA'
Prosecutors from the Minnesota attorney general's office told the court they had no control over the city's mayor, council or news media.
""You would agree that this is unfortunate, wouldn't you?"" the judge asked prosecutors. ""That we have this reported all over the media when we're in the midst of jury selection?"" 
A spokeswoman for the city said she would inquire whether Mayor Jacob Frey had any comment.
The first potential juror to appear in court on Monday, who appeared to be a white woman in her 50s, said the size of the settlement made an impression on her and that she was familiar with civil litigation from her work in human resources.
""My guess is that with that large of a settlement the city did not feel it would prevail in court,"" she told the judge, who went on to dismiss her.
Jurors seated last week include four white men, one of them Hispanic; one white woman; a woman of mixed race; and a Black man who immigrated to the United States about 14 years ago. All but one are in their 20s and 30s, the court said. Judge Cahill has promised the jurors anonymity for the duration of the trial.
An eighth juror was picked later on Monday: a Black man in his 30s who has worked in the banking industry and said he likes writing poetry and coaching and watching sports.
He said he strongly supported the message of the Black Lives Matter movement, and that he was able to be impartial in weighing Chauvin's conduct.
""I don't think he had any intention of harming anyone,"" he said of Chauvin, ""but somebody did die.""
Chauvin, 44, is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He has pleaded not guilty, saying he followed his police training.
All potential jurors who have appeared so far said they know who Chauvin is and what the video shows him doing; most said they had formed a negative opinion of him, though some said they could remain open to the possibility his actions were not criminal.

The court is planning to have opening arguments commence on March 29. Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted on the most serious charge.

CHAMPHAI, India (Reuters) - More than 400 people from Myanmar, many of them policemen, have crossed into neighbouring India since late February, an Indian police officer said on Monday, as Myanmar security forces seek to crush pro-democracy demonstrators after last month's coup. 
The policemen said they had fled because they feared persecution after refusing to obey the military junta's orders to shoot protesters. 
""About 116 crossed on Friday,"" the police officer in the Indian state of Mizoram told Reuters, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. They included policemen and firemen, some of whom carried only clothes stuffed into white plastic sacks as they crossed the border.
India's federal government has ordered local authorities to stop the influx but the mountain terrain is porous and hard to patrol. There are also close ethnic and cultural ties between the people on the two sides of the remote border.
Around 140 people have died so far and thousands detained in Myanmar since the Feb. 1 military coup. Protesters continue to take to the streets in defiance of the authorities, who have used rubber bullets, tear gas and live ammunition to stop them.
On Monday security forces shot dead six people taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations, media and witnesses said.
Myanmar's junta says it is exercising great restraint in handling what it describes as demonstrations by ""riotous protesters"" whom it accuses of attacking police and harming national security and stability.
'I SUPPORT THE CDM'
One of the largest groups of recent arrivals in India - numbering around 100 - are housed in a village in Mizoram's Champhai district, a short drive on rough mountain roads from the Tiau river that marks the border between the two countries.
A handful of them sat in a sunlit room on Monday, smoking hand-rolled cigarettes and hunched over their phones. One watched Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) videos of protesters clashing with Myanmar security forces.
Among those sheltering in the village, which local community leaders asked not to name, was a fire department official from Myanmar's Chin state who gave his name only as Khaw.
The official said his superiors had asked him on Feb. 18 to hose down and disperse anti-coup demonstrators.
Khaw, 34, said he had refused the order and stopped going to work, along with 20 other firemen.
""I support the CDM,"" he said, referring to the civil disobedience movement against Myanmar's junta.
""I didn't want to be under the control of the military,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter, adding that 16 other Myanmar firemen had also sought shelter in the Indian village.
Reuters was not in a position to verify his account. A spokesman for the junta could not be reached for comment.
Last week, some Myanmar police who fled to India told Reuters they had been ordered to directly shoot at protesters.
But Khaw's account is among the first from emergency service officials fleeing Myanmar after disobeying orders.
Khaw said he did not carry any Myanmar ID in case he was caught by the country's security forces, but he showed Reuters recent photos of himself in a fireman's uniform.
After joining the civil disobedience movement, Khaw said he hid in a forested area of Chin state with around 30 others.
On March 3, Myanmar security forces discovered their hideout, forcing him to flee the country, leaving behind his wife and four children.

Asked about his family's safety, Khaw said: ""That's my biggest fear.""

The WHO appealed to countries not to suspend vaccinations against a disease that has caused more than 2.7 million deaths worldwide.
Last week Darias said her administration was monitoring the situation but had only detected light side-effects such as headaches, dizziness and intestinal trouble.
Nevertheless, several Spanish regions decided to stop using the vaccine until more information became available.

The original owner - Nora Stiasny, from a well-known Austrian Jewish family - had to sell the painting ""Rosiers sous les Arbres"" at a knock-down price to survive financially after the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938, Bachelot said.
She was deported to Poland in 1942 and died the same year.
The art dealer, a Nazi sympathiser, held onto it until his death in the 1960s and France, unaware of its history, eventually bought it at auction for the Musee d'Orsay in Paris in 1980, the minister added.
""This decision to return a major artwork from the public collections illustrates our commitment to justice and to reparation for the looted families"", Bachelot said

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Syria marks a decade of conflict the United Nations expressed ""profound regret"" on Monday that it has not yet been able to mediate an end to the civil war. 
A crackdown on pro-democracy protesters by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2011 led to civil war, with Russia backing Assad and the United States supporting the opposition. Millions of people have fled Syria and millions are internally displaced.
""I express the profound regret of the United Nations that we have yet not been able to mediate an end to this tragic conflict,"" U.N. Syria mediator Geir Pedersen told the U.N. Security Council on Monday. 
Pedersen, who was appointed in late 2018, is the fourth person to lead U.N. efforts to end the Syrian war.
""The Syrian tragedy will go down as one of the darkest chapters in recent history – the Syrian people are among the greatest victims of this century,"" Pedersen said. 
""They have been injured, maimed and killed in every way imaginable – their corpses even desecrated. ... They have endured the unspeakable horrors of chemical weapons,"" he told the 15-member body, which has been deadlocked over Syria with Syrian ally Russia and China pitted against Western members. 
Russia has vetoed 16 Security Council resolutions on Syria over the past decade, backed by China for many of those votes.
""There's only one reason we have not been able to enact this solution and resolve this crisis: the Assad regime's refusal to engage in good faith,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the council. ""So, we call on Russia to press the Assad regime to quit stalling.""
Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia blamed ""external forces"" for tapping into the 2011 unrest in a bid to overthrow Assad's government and called for an end to unilateral sanctions on the country. 
""We view a key precondition in the peace settlement to be the cessation of foreign occupation and military activities which have not been approved by the legitimate government of the country,"" Nebenzia said. 
Islamic State also took advantage of the chaos to gain a foothold in Syria for some time. The United States and allies began military action against the group in 2014. Turkey still controls swaths of territory in Syria's northwest and the United States has a presence in the northeast.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that Syria is a ""living nightmare"" where about half the children have never lived a day without war and 60 percent of Syrians are at risk of going hungry.

SANA quoted a security source as saying the plot, which involved the use of explosive belts, was thwarted with the cooperation of residents of two towns of a formerly rebel-held rural region southwest of Damascus.
It did not say when the would-be attack was foiled, or give further details.
President Bashar al-Assad's government regained control over the heavily populated region from insurgents about three years ago after reaching reconciliation deals with its local elders.
But security forces continue to restrict movement into the towns of Kanaker and Sasaa, from which those involved in the bombing plot came according to state media.
Russian-brokered deals brought back much of the strategic southern border area with Jordan and Israel back under state control after years in rebel hands. But the region continues to suffer from lawlessness and targeted killings, residents say.
(This story corrects, in paragraph 5, name of second town cited in state media to Zakia, not Sasaa)

A tweet on Wine's Twitter handle said Wine was arrested while leading MPs in a peaceful protest at City Square in Kampala against ""the abduction, torture and murder of his supporters"". A tweet 90 minutes later said he had been driven in a police truck back to his home, which was surrounded by police and the military. 
Police spokesman Patrick Onyango was not immediately reachable. The government has said Wine is trying to destabilize Uganda via violent and illegal protests.
Wine, 39, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, lost a Jan. 14 presidential election to Yoweri Museveni, who has led the country since 1986. 
Last month Wine filed a supreme court challenge seeking cancellation of the results, saying he won and citing impossibly high voter turnout in some areas. He however later withdrew the case, saying the judges were biased.
Video footage on Ghetto TV, an online broadcaster affiliated with Wine's National Unity Platform opposition party, showed police dragging Wine away from the crowd of supporters and other party members he was leading in a march down a Kampala street.
In a suit and tie and wearing his trademark red beret, Wine held a placard bearing the words ""Bring Back Our People,"" referring to hundreds of supporters he says have been abducted by security agents. 
A lawmaker who grew up in a Kampala slum and gained popularity as a singer before running for office in 2017, Wine mounted a formidable challenge to Museveni.

Wine's election rallies were routinely broken up with bullets, beatings, teargas and detentions and he was arrested several times while campaigning. Authorities said he violated COVID-19-related restrictions on public gatherings.

KADUNA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Gunmen on motorbikes stormed a primary school in the northwestern Nigerian state of Kaduna and kidnapped three teachers but no children, a state official said on Monday after the fifth school abduction in three months. 
It was the first attack on an elementary school in a wave of such attacks in which more than 700 people have been abducted since December. 
Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna state's commissioner for internal security, said in a press briefing that Rema Primary School, in the Birnin Gwari Local Government Area, was attacked at around 8:50am (0750 GMT) on Monday. 
He said children fled as gunmen, referred to locally as bandits, entered the compound shortly after pupils arrived. 
""This led to two pupils going missing. We are happy to inform you that the two missing pupils have been found,"" Aruwan said. ""We can also confirm that no single pupil was kidnapped from the school.
""The government can confirm that three teachers... have been kidnapped.""
Nigeria's kidnapping scourge began with the seizure of 270 girls from a school in the northeastern town of Chibok by the Islamist insurgent group Boko Haram in 2014. Around 100 of the schoolgirls have never been found.
Armed criminal gangs in Nigeria's widely lawless north have since carried out many copycat attacks seeking ransom.
The presidency said late in February that President Muhammadu Buhari had urged state governments to ""review their policy of rewarding bandits with money and vehicles, warning that the policy might boomerang disastrously"".
Attempts by the military and police to tackle the gangs have had little success, while many worry that state authorities are making the situation worse by letting kidnappers go unpunished, paying them off or providing incentives.
Nigeria's federal government has said it will ""take out"" abductors after criticising local deals to free victims.
A presidency spokesman said he did not have the details of Monday's kidnapping.
Armed men attempted to kidnap more students in Kaduna state overnight on Sunday, as 39 others from an earlier attack in the state remain missing. 
The rampant banditry has become a political problem for Buhari, a retired general and former military ruler who has faced mounting criticism over the rise in violent crime, and replaced his long-standing military chiefs earlier this year.

Buhari held talks with security officials and regional elders last week about Nigeria's multiple security challenges. Afterwards, national security adviser Babagana Monguno said the government would take a tough stance against criminal gangs.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - With theatres closed and work prospects dim, Czech actor Tomas Novotny put his stage career on hold and trained to become a gravedigger.
The coronavirus reshaping Europe's labour markets has spurred workers like Novotny to seek new career paths as old jobs disappear or remain beset with uncertainty about any return to normal.
Not all changes are as dramatic as that of the 36-year-old actor but his is an early illustration of a shift that will require people to take on new skills to compete.
""I'm glad for this opportunity,"" Novotny told Reuters at a training site in Prague, demonstrating a technique using wood and iron rods to roll a 600-kg tombstone off a grave.
""The uncertainty and not knowing when we can return to normal is the worst thing ... This gives me some work and if things go well I could be in charge of a cemetery.""
Widespread use of furloughs in Europe's meant unemployment there rose less than in the United States. But as these schemes wind down, the fear is that many jobs in pandemic-scarred sectors will no longer be viable.
Some 100 million workers in advanced economies will need to switch occupations within the next decade, 25% more than expected before COVID-19, consultancy McKinsey forecasts.
The challenge posed by greater automation or online activity due to the pandemic also means workers will need to acquire new skills at a rate scarcely seen before - providing a big edge to those who remain employed with access to in-company training.
The Czech Confederation of Employers and Business Association, expects a 10-fold rise in numbers taking re-qualification courses this year.
""The need for re-qualification will grow because the pandemic is speeding the need for companies to adapt,"" its president, Jan Wiesner, said.
WOMEN, YOUNG WORKERS AT SHARP END
Less well educated workers and those in hard-hit sectors like the service industry often lose out on training programmes, said Barbara Gerstenberger, Head of the Working Life unit at Dublin-based Eurofound, which seeks to improve living and working conditions in the European Union.
Because of that, she said, young people and women will suffer disproportionately in this downturn and, potentially lacking the necessary skills upgrades, find it harder to re-enter the workforce.
""Up-skilling and retraining is up to them,"" she told Reuters. ""If this situation is not reversed it will lead to longer-term consequences.""
The economic stakes are high. While inequalities could worsen within populations, individual countries better placed to handle the shift could gain a competitive advantage over others in the bloc.
Enzo Weber, a job market expert at Germany's IAB think-tank, said Europe’s largest economy could emerge relatively well from the crisis, given its system of further education and vocational and in-house training. 
""But this only works as long as firms are not going bust and have a clear view where their business is heading,"" Weber said.
""If a company - let's say in classic retailing or aviation – is running into trouble, one of the first things it will do is scaling back efforts for vocational training.""
An IAB survey last year showed that just 5% of furloughed employees were in job qualification or retraining programmes, suggesting many companies are hoping they can carry as before once the crisis ends, he noted.
DIGITAL SKILLS DEFICIT
Even before COVID-19, however, Europe was falling behind in the digital economy. 
A European Court of Auditors report last month showed a third of adults in EU employment had no basic skills in that key area and that EU spending over the last 5-10 years had failed to help.
A shortfall in digital skills is also a concern for companies in Britain, where the government faces calls to devote resources to quick-fire training programmes. 
The EU hopes to address its deficit, as well as the concern that the bloc's wealthier countries will adapt better to post-COVID economic realities, with a 750-billion-euro ($894 billion)recovery fund that member states signed off on last summer.
Aimed at generating an additional two percentage points of GDP in the euro area by 2026, the fund also sets an ambitious goal of have 120 million adults per year participating in learning.
As part of that retraining push, the European Commission has received 10-11 billion euros from partners in the automotive, microelectronics and defence industries. 
Encouraging member states to re-skill workers worst affected by the pandemic, notably women, young people and vulnerable groups, was a priority for the Commission, a spokesman said.
While Czech actor Novotny dreams of possibly returning to the stage one day, 30-year-old German hospitality worker Caroline Luebke is looking forward to retraining as a certified office management assistant.
Germany's Labour Office has organised and financed her two-and-half year course offering a mix of theory and practice she hopes gives her more options in an uncertain labour market.
""The coronavirus crisis has changed everything,"" Luebke told Reuters. ""For me, hospitality can’t offer the same job security anymore. Who knows when the next pandemic will hit?""

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Afghan peace talks, now stalled in Qatar, should be rotated to other venues, Afghanistan's ambassador to the United Arab Emirates said, indicating the Qatari hosts had not pushed hard enough for the Taliban to reduce violence.
Talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban have been held in Qatar since last year, after the United States agreed to withdraw its troops. But violence has increased and the government accuses the militants of failing to meet obligations to reduce attacks.
Ambassador Javid Ahmad said peace talks should not be held in one fixed location, but rotate among venues in Europe, Asia, the Middle East or Afghanistan itself. He later told Reuters his comments reflected his personal view and not that of the Afghan government.
The Taliban, which opened an office in Qatar in 2013, were too ""comfortable"" there, he said. ""We want the Taliban to get out of their comfort zone.” 
""The Qataris could have used its role as a host to play a more active and decisive role in pushing the Taliban to reduce violence or declare a ceasefire,"" Ahmad said. “They have not properly used their leverage, as a host to the Taliban ..., to push the group's leaders to declare a ceasefire or to visibly reduce violence.""
Qatar's government communications office said Doha was committed to supporting Afghans by hosting the talks, and would like to see a reduction in violence leading ""to continued peace and security in the country"".
""The fact that representatives of the Afghan government and the Taliban are still at the table shows that the negotiations are working,"" it said.
Russia will hold a conference on Afghanistan this week, while Turkey hosts talks next month as the United States seeks to shake-up the process, proposing an interim administration.
Ahmad said Afghanistan's ""participatory government"" had ""the capacity to absorb the Taliban and ex-combatants"" but that the only way to achieve a transition of power was through elections.
The Taliban have said they are committed to the peace negotiations.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration signed a troop withdrawal deal with the Taliban in February 2020 under which all international forces were expected to leave the country by May 1.

However, violence has risen and NATO officials say some conditions of the deal, including the Taliban cutting ties with international militant groups, have not been met, which the Taliban disputes.

617,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 11:46AM ET</span>",Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny says he is at strict prison camp outside Moscow,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is being held in a prison camp in Russia's Vladimir region northeast of Moscow known for its strict control of inmates, a message posted on the opposition politician's Instagram account confirmed on Monday.
Navalny's precise location had been unknown after his legal team said last week that he had been moved from the nearby Kolchugino jail and that they had not been told where he was being taken.
On Monday, Navalny confirmed he was fine and being held at the IK-2 corrective penal colony in the town of Pokrov, about 100 km (60 miles) east of Moscow. 
""Hi everyone from 'Heightened control sector A',"" Navalny said in a message posted online shortly after his lawyers visited him at the facility. 
""I have to admit that the Russian prison system has managed to surprise me. I never imagined that it was possible to build a real concentration camp 100 kilometres from Moscow"". 
The post was accompanied by a picture of Navalny sat on a sofa with his hair cropped close to his head. 
Navalny, 44, one of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critics, was jailed earlier this year for parole violations in a decision that the West has condemned as politically motivated.
He is due to serve out a two-and-a-half year sentence and is only able to communicate with the outside world via his lawyers. 
The Instagram post said that swearing was banned at the facility and that the ban was widely observed by fellow inmates who seemed scared to turn their heads twice.
He said he had not seen any prison violence or suggestion of it himself but could believe stories he had heard about past cases of violence.
""There are video cameras everywhere, they keep watch on everyone and make reports for the slightest infractions. I think someone high up has read 1984 by Orwell,"" he said. 
He said he was woken up every hour during the night because he had been deemed a flight risk. 
""But if you regard everything with humour, you can live here. So on the whole everything is fine with me,"" he said. 
Navalny returned to Russia in January from Germany where he had been recuperating from being poisoned with what many Western nations said was a nerve agent. The Kremlin has denied involvement in his illness and questioned if he was poisoned. 

Western countries have called for Navalny's release, and the United States and European Union have imposed sanctions against Russian officials over the case.

618,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 11:05AM ET</span>",Ugandan leader says not yet had COVID vaccine as he's 'careful',"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda's president Yoweri Museveni has said he has not yet been vaccinated against COVID-19 because he is ""careful"" and is still weighing which jab to take, days after the East African country began its inoculation campaign.
The apparent hesitation may fuel already significant vaccine scepticism in the country, which is in the earliest stages of its roll out of the jab. Many African countries have struggled to get doses and have not administered a single shot.
Uganda began vaccinating health workers and the elderly last week after receiving 864,000 doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine from COVAX, the World Health Organisation-backed programme to provide vaccines to poor and developing countries.
At 76 years old, Museveni is eligible to be vaccinated.
But in a televised address late on Sunday, the president demanded an apology from the country's largest independent local paper, Daily Monitor, which reported last month that Museveni and some relatives have been vaccinated. 
""The reason I have not been vaccinated is first of all I am quite careful,"" Museveni said, adding the vaccine rollout was starting with highly vulnerable people like health workers. ""I am also looking at which of the vaccines should I go for.""
Like much of Africa, with the notable exception of South Africa, Uganda has recorded a comparatively mild outbreak of COVID-19, with infections so far totalling about 40,500 and 334 recorded dead, according to official statistics. 
The nation of 42 million people imposed strict measures shortly after recording its first COVID-19 case, and while most of the strict measures have since been eased, some like an overnight curfew and closures of bars remain.
Museveni's hesitancy was likely to encourage ""extreme vaccine pessimism"" among Ugandans, Peter Mwesige, co-founder of a local think-tank, said in a tweet.
In addition to the about 3.5 million doses in total that Uganda hopes to receive from COVAX, the government says it has also ordered 18 million doses of AstraZeneca from the Serum Institute of India and that up to 40% of that order is expected to arrive by the end of March. The Serum Institute of India told Reuters at the time that it had not yet signed any deal with Uganda.
The Ugandan leader was speaking two days after officials in neighbouring Tanzania insisted President John Magufuli is in good health and working normally, following reports he was in critical condition with COVID-19 and receiving treatment abroad. 
Magufuli, 61, is Africa's most prominent coronavirus sceptic. He has not been seen in public since Feb. 27.
On Monday Tanzania's vice president, speaking while on an official trip in the country's north, urged Tanzanians not to listen to rumours from outside the country. 

""I would like to assure you Tanzania is safe,"" Samia Hassan Suluhu said. She added, without elaborating: ""It is normal for a human being to be checked with flu, fever ... anything else.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Grief and rage over the murder of Londoner Sarah Everard should be channelled into efforts to stop men's violence against women, not into political arguments about police tactics at a vigil, one of the women arrested at the event said on Monday.
Everard, 33, was abducted as she walked home in south London on March 3 and a police officer has been charged with her kidnap and murder, provoking a national debate over how British society deals with male violence against women.
But the political focus shifted onto London's Metropolitan Police after officers trying to disperse a vigil for Everard that breached COVID-19 lockdown rules scuffled with mourners and dragged women away in handcuffs on Saturday.
Patsy Stevenson - who was pictured being pinned to the ground, handcuffed and arrested by male officers in dramatic images that became a lightning rod for anger against the police - said on Monday she was dismayed at the turn of events.
""I accidentally went viral. I didn't want this to happen. This happened like a whirlwind,"" she said on Sky News.
""I've been thrown into the public eye and the only way I can make this not in vain is to not make it political, not against the police. It's just about the safety of women and we need to talk about it,"" she said. 
An estimated 85,000 women are raped and more than 400,000 sexually assaulted in England and Wales each year, with only a tiny fraction of incidents leading to criminal convictions.
The most recent figures showed the conviction rate per rape allegation recorded by the police was 2.6%, a record low.
On Monday, the media focus was on whether the head of the Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, should resign over Saturday's ugly scenes.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that he had full confidence in London's police chief. 
""The fundamental issue that we have to address as a country, as a society, as government, is that women must feel ... that when they make serious complaints about violence, about assault, that they are properly heard and properly addressed,"" he said.
""A MALE PROBLEM""
Since Everard's disappearance, many women have taken to social media to recount their own experiences of harassment and assault on Britain's streets and to demand change.
One of the factors that turned the case into a rallying cry for women was the fact that police advised women near the spot where Everard went missing to stay at home for their own safety. This enraged many women who said the onus should be on men to change their behaviour, not on women to give up their freedoms.
White Ribbon UK, a charity that aims to end violence against women and girls by engaging with men and boys, was calling on them to make a stand in the wake of Everard's murder.
""It must not fall on women to have to change how they go about their lives because of the fear and the risk of violence. This is a male problem and men must be the ones to take ownership,"" said Peter Lassey, chair of White Ribbon UK.
A protest is due to take place on Parliament Square later on Monday under the banner ""End Violence Against Women"".
But one of Everard's friends, Helena Edwards, said the case had been ""hijacked"" by people with an agenda.

""Sarah was a victim of one of the most horrific crimes imaginable. She was extremely unlucky - that is all there is to it,"" Edwards wrote in a blog, adding that if the suspect was found guilty, she would hold him alone responsible.

No one was reported hurt, but the paper said personnel from the emergency services, Interior Ministry and Federal Security Service were on site.
Novaya Gazeta, which was set up after the breakup of the Soviet Union, and its reporters have for years been subjected to intimidation and attacks since the paper began investigating official corruption and rights violations. 
One of its most prominent journalists, Anna Politkovskaya, was assassinated in 2006, after notably exposing abuses in a war in the southern Russian region of Chechnya. 
In a statement on its website, the newspaper said the odour was similar to that of an unidentified gas sprayed on the home and car of Yulia Latynina, one of its journalists, in an attack in July 2017.

Past attempts to intimidate staff have included the placing of a ram's head and a funeral wreath outside the office, as well as a white envelope sent through the mail containing an unidentified white powder, the paper said.

RABAT/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Morocco hopes its improved ties with Israel and centuries-old Jewish history will help it offset some of the tourist trade it has lost to the global pandemic by bringing a surge of Israeli visitors once flights restart next month. 
The two countries agreed in December to resume diplomatic ties and relaunch direct flights - part of a deal brokered by the United States that also includes Washington's recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. 
""I was quite afraid to go previously, because it's an Arab country, even though I was told that tours there were fine. Now that there is peace, I think I can go without fear,"" said retired Israeli teacher Rivka Sheetrit, 69, who wants to see where her parents once lived and her forefathers were buried.
""When the skies reopen I plan to go,"" she said.
Morocco was home to one of the largest and most prosperous Jewish communities in North Africa and the Middle East for centuries until Israel's founding in 1948. As Jews fled or were expelled from many Arab countries, an estimated quarter of a million left Morocco for Israel from 1948-1964.
Today only about 3,000 Jews remain in Morocco, while hundreds of thousands of Israelis claim some Moroccan ancestry.
More than other countries in the region where the issue is often taboo, Morocco has sought in recent years to recognise the Jewish role in its history. In 2010, it launched a programme to restore synagogues, Jewish cemeteries and heritage sites, and reinstated the original names of some Jewish neighbourhoods.
Though the numbers of Israeli visitors are likely to be small compared to the total pre-COVID-19 tourist flow to Morocco, it could help a sector battered by the pandemic.
Tourism minister Nadia Fettah Alaoui has said she expects 200,000 Israeli visitors in the first year following the resumption of direct flights. That compares to about 13 million yearly foreign tourists before the pandemic. Tourism revenue fell by 53.8% to 36.3 billion dirhams ($3.8 billion) in 2020.
In the pretty Moroccan port town of Essaouira, once home to a big Jewish community and still the location of several important shrines, tourism businesses are poised for a boost.
Ayoub Souri, who has a woodcraft shop near a Jewish museum, expects business to thrive: ""We look forward to receiving more Jewish tourists after the normalisation deal,"" he said. 
OPTIMISTIC 
Though a small number of Israeli tourists already come to Morocco, many have been put off by the lack of direct flights and diplomatic ties. The head of the Israeli liaison office in Rabat, which reopened after the deal, said he expected flights to resume next month. 
""This is the main reason the number of Israeli tourists will increase significantly,"" the liaison chief, David Govrin, said. 
Morocco’s tourism promotion office has commissioned a study on attracting tourists from Israel.
Henri Abizker, a Jewish community leader and businessman in Rabat who owns a travel agency organising tours for Israelis, said he was even more optimistic about the numbers, predicting up to 400,000 would come.
Morocco is attractive because of its particular Jewish history as home to pilgrimage sites, attracting tourism that could benefit specialist operators.
""Younger generations tend to be more liberal, but orthodox Jews insist on Kosher requirements,"" he said. 
In Israel, Haim Peretz, an Israeli of Jewish Moroccan descent who now works as a tour guide, said potential tourists were mainly waiting for direct flights. 

""We expect, in principle, that demand for tourism in Morocco will grow,"" he said.

ALEPPO, Syria (Reuters) - Mohammed Abu Rdan has known nothing but conflict throughout his short life.
Born in rural Aleppo in 2011 when peaceful protests against President Bashar al-Assad's government began, his childhood is anything but typical.
The protests quickly turned into a multi-sided conflict that has sucked in world powers, killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions more and with it upended Abu Rdan's life.
Now living in a displaced peoples' camp in northern Aleppo, Abu Rdan has become his family's main breadwinner after heart disease rendered his father unfit to work. 
Like for many other Syrian children, school has become a distant dream. 
""We had a house and I used to go to school everyday.. but we came here... they destroyed our house and our school,"" Abu Rdan said. 
The United Nations' Children's Fund (UNICEF) said earlier this month that 90% of children in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance, a 20% increase over the past year alone. 
'GRAVE VIOLATIONS'
Ten years into the conflict, almost 2.45 million children in Syria and an additional 750,000 Syrian children in neighbouring countries are out of school, UNICEF figures show. 
Abu Rdan wakes up at dawn every day and braves the cold to stand by the side of the highway and hitch a ride for the 10 kms (6.2 miles) to the cleaning products factory where he works. 
His long working days, mostly up to 10 hours, earn him 100 Turkish liras ($13) a month. It is all the income his family makes. 
Abu Rdan is paid in Turkey's currency as he lives and works in an area controlled by Turkish-backed rebels, having fled from his hometown, the village of Marshoureen which is now government-held. 
Assad now holds sway over many parts of the country, helped by Russia's military and Iran's Shi'ite militias but Turkey, which backed rebels who sought to overthrow him, has power over swathes of territory in the northwest.
UNICEF says more than 75% of grave violations against children recorded in Syria in 2020 - including killing, maiming, recruitment into fighting, sexual violence and attacks on schools - were in the northwest. 
Packing goods into large sacks, some of them twice his size, Abu Rdan is so exhausted by the time he goes back home he can do nothing but eat and sleep. 
""When I come back from work I'm so tired, I just put my head down and I'm out,"" he said. 
He shares a tent with his parents and three sisters that does little to shield them from Syria's harsh winter that includes torrential rain and snow. 
To keep warm, he has become an expert at making his own cup of tea, working the gas cylinder with the confidence of a grown up. 
Having been propelled into responsibilities far beyond his age, the 10-year old handles a lot of daily chores with the expertise of a much older man.

A report on state TV described the base as a ""missile city"" and showed rows of what looked like missiles in a depot with cement walls. It did not give any details on its location.
Alireza Tangsiri, the head of the elite Revolutionary Guards' naval unit, told state TV the base had equipment to detect enemy signals.
The report said the base's “electronic warfare equipment” included radar, monitoring, simulation and disruption systems.
“What we see today is a small section of the great and expansive missile capability of Revolutionary Guards’ naval forces,” Guards commander Major general Hossein Salami said in the broadcast.
Last year, the Guards force said it had built a number of underground “missile cities” along the Gulf coastline.
Iran, which routinely boasts of technological advances in its armed forces, has one of the biggest missile programmes in the Middle East.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Myanmar trade unionists have been arrested and harassed in door to door searches, while others are hiding in fear, the International Labour Organization said after receiving a formal complaint from the world's largest trade union federation.
The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) reported widespread restrictions on workers' rights imposed by Myanmar's military since the Feb. 1 coup, a document dated March 11, prepared for the ILO's Governing Body, shows.
Myanmar security forces fired on pro-democracy demonstrators on Monday killing six people, media and witnesses said, a day after dozens of protesters were shot dead and attackers torched several Chinese-financed factories in the city of Yangon.
""Complaints have been received from workers who have been threatened and intimidated due to their absence from work and participation in the CDM (civil disobedience movement),"" said the ILO.
There was no immediate reply from Myanmar's mission in Geneva to a Reuters request for comment.
The U.N. agency, which monitored forced labour for years in the country, still has programmes there addressing child labour.
Military authorities have curtailed freedoms of speech and assembly, blocked social media and declared 16 labour-related organisations illegal, leaving three registered trade union confederations, the ILO said.
The ITUC lodged a complaint on March 5 to the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association ""concerning widespread violation of freedom of association and basic civil liberties by the Myanmar military"", it said of the Brussels-based body.
ILO's Governing Body is to review the complaint on March 22.
The forum - composed of representatives from states, employers' groups and workers organisations - is to consider a draft resolution expressing ""grave concern about the arrest, intimidation and threats against trade unionists, as well as the declaration that 16 labour organizations were illegal"".
The military should drop any charges against trade unions who have peacefully participated in protests, the resolution says.

ILO director-general Guy Ryder - a former ITUC head - last month issued statements calling for a halt to the intimidation of workers and restoration of civilian rule.

BENI, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Attackers killed at least a dozen villagers in an overnight raid on a village in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, a witness and two civil rights groups said on Monday.
They blamed the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan militia active in eastern Congo since the 1990s, which has committed dozens of brutal reprisal attacks on civilians since the army began operations against it in late 2019.
Men armed with knives and other weapons attacked the village of Bulongo, around 30 kilometres (18 miles) east of Beni, on Sunday night, the sources said.
""There are 12 bodies lying on the ground,"" said Mambo Kitambal, head of a civil society group in Bulongo.
""We fear that this toll could increase especially since the enemy operated for several hours. The victims were executed with pickaxes and machetes,"" he said. 
On Wednesday the United States designated the ADF as a foreign terrorist organisation, accusing it of links to Islamic State (ISIS), although U.N. experts have not found evidence of any direct relationship between the two groups.
The ADF killed about 850 people last year, according to U.N. figures.
""Here in the rain they savagely killed our brothers and sisters with knives and pickaxes,"" said Paul Sakata, a resident of Bulongo.
""We regret that the army did not respond last night, which reinforces the fear in the heads of people in this part of the country, who were beginning to hope for peace.""
Congo's eastern borderlands with Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi are home to around 120 different militias, many of which are remnants of the country's brutal civil wars that officially ended in 2003.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Janette Condon, Belinda Barnard and Xero Marks were bound by something stronger than gender as they joined tens of thousands of women to protest against sexual violence at Australia's Parliament House on Monday.
The three generations of the same family joined the ""March 4 Justice"" rallies as women converged in cities across the country to express solidarity with victims of sexual assault.
""I want to be able to feel safe and I want to feel protected and I want to know that people in parliament are going to do something about it,"" said Marks, 11, who identifies as non-binary.
The protests were in response to a string of allegations of sexual assault connected to Australia's parliament, including a historic rape allegation levelled at Attorney-General Christian Porter, who strongly denies the claim. 
Another allegation was made by a former staffer of the ruling conservative coalition, Brittany Higgins, who says she was raped inside Parliament House. She addressed the crowd as Marks, Marks's mother Barnard, 44, and grandmother Condon, 65, looked on. 
""The conversation has moved on in the last thirty years but I'd like it to leap a lot further forward for my children,"" said Barnard.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's High Court granted bail on Monday to three more activists in a case against 47 people accused of conspiracy to subvert the government after holding an informal 2020 poll to select candidates for legislative elections.
The case is being closely watched by foreign diplomats and rights groups concerned with the shrinking space for dissent in Hong Kong, which took an authoritarian turn with Beijing's imposition of a sweeping national security law in June 2020.
Monday's decision took to 11 the total of those granted bail in the case. It came after the court heard prosecutors' appeals against an earlier decision to grant bail to four pro-democracy activists, one of whom was denied bail.
Hong Kong laws restrict media coverage of bail hearings.
The new law, which sets terms of up to life in prison for what China broadly defines as subversion, secessionism, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces, has provisions that clash with the former British colony's common law traditions.
The case of the 47 accused of conspiracy highlights a key departure from previous practice, as the new law throws on defendants the responsibility of proving that they would not be a threat to China's national security if released on bail.
This high bar means defendants could spend months in custody before trials begin.
Supporters of Beijing say the law and crackdown on opposition is necessary to restore order after prolonged and often-violent mass pro-democracy protests in 2019.
The 47 are accused of organising and participating in an unofficial, non-binding primary poll in July 2020 that authorities called part of a ""vicious plot"" to ""overthrow"" the government.
The vote aimed to select the strongest opposition candidates for a Legislative Council election that the government postponed subsequently, citing efforts to limit spread of the coronavirus.
Some of the candidates had said that if the opposition won an unprecedented majority it could utilise it to strong-arm the Beijing-backed government to pursue democratic reforms.
Since the 47 were charged on Feb 28, courts have heard a series of requests for bail and appeals by both defendants and prosecutors.

The 11 given bail so far include Kalvin Ho, Sze Tak-loy and Lee Yue-shun on Monday. Another, Sam Cheung, was remanded in custody.

DUBAI (Reuters) - French tourist Benjamin Briere, who was arrested in Iran 10 months ago, faces charges of ""spying and propaganda against the system"", one of his lawyers told Reuters on Monday, at a time of heightened tension between Tehran and the West. 
The revelation comes as the United States and European parties to Iran's 2015 nuclear deal, including France, are trying to restore the pact that was abandoned in 2018 by then-U.S. President Donald Trump. 
U.S. President Joe Biden has offered to join European countries in talks to revive the accord, but Tehran says Washington should first lift sanctions imposed in 2018 by Trump.
""On Sunday, he (Briere) was charged with two counts of espionage and propaganda against the Islamic Republic,"" his lawyer Saeid Dehghan said, adding that Briere faces a long-term jail sentence.
Dehghan said the 35-year-old had been arrested after flying a helicam in the desert near the Turkmenistan-Iran border.
""His last defence was taken yesterday. His spying charges is because of taking pictures in forbidden areas,"" Dehghan said.
""He is in the Vakilabad prison in the city of Mashhad. His health is good and he has access to his lawyers and also he benefits from consular protection and the French embassy officials have been in regular contact with him.""
Iran's judiciary was not available to comment. France has yet to comment on Briere's charges. Last month, France's foreign ministry confirmed that a French citizen was being held in Iran and said it was monitoring the situation.
""Although the French government is pursuing Briere's case, I am concerned that any delay in comprehensive follow-up will further complicate the case,"" Dehghan said. 
The lawyer said Briere has been charged with ""propaganda against the system"" because of a post on social media, in which he said ""the hijab is mandatory"" in the Islamic Republic of Iran, but not in other Islamic countries. 
""My colleagues and I believe that these charges are false and baseless, but we have to wait for the judge to conduct a full investigation in the next few days and announce his verdict,"" Dehghan said. 
A person close to his family told Reuters last month that Briere, who works in the events industry, had travelled to Iran by van from France. 
Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards have arrested dozens of dual nationals and foreigners in recent years, mostly on espionage charges.
Rights activists have accused Iran of arresting dual nationals and foreigners to try to win concessions from other countries. Tehran denies it holds people for political reasons and has accused many of the foreigners in its jails of espionage.

This appears to be the first news of Houthi drones being fired into Saudi Arabia in almost a week. 
Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said three drones had been fired at military targets at Abha airport and the King Khalid air base in the southern town of Khamis Mushait. He said the targets had been struck. 
There was no immediate Saudi confirmation that those locations had been hit, but the coalition said it had intercepted a Houthi drone early on Monday fired towards Khamis Mushait.
Houthi attacks into Saudi Arabia have escalated in recent weeks. On March 7 the coalition said a barrage of drones and missiles had been intercepted en route to their targets, which included an oil storage yard at Ras Tanura, site of a refinery and the world's biggest offshore oil-loading facility as well as a residential compound in Dhahran used by state-controlled oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222). 
The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed government from power in the capital, Sanaa. The conflict is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
The United Nations and the United States have urged the Houthis, who are also pressing an offensive against government-held Marib city in Yemen, to turn to negotiations rather then military escalation.
U.S. special envoy on Yemen Tim Lenderking said last week a ""sound plan"" for a nationwide ceasefire in Yemen has been put to the Houthi leadership.

Police in the southeastern city of Fuzhou said the driver had been detained, and Didi said it was cooperating with the investigation and company representatives had visited the victim's family. 
""After an argument, the driver drove the car and repeatedly rammed into the male passenger and caused his death,"" Didi said on Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), China's Twitter-like social media platform.
Two cases of rape and murder in 2018 involving Didi drivers put the firm under public and government scrutiny.

The China Meteorological Administration announced a yellow alert on Monday morning, saying sandstorms had spread from Inner Mongolia into the provinces of Gansu, Shanxi and Hebei, which surrounds Beijing.
The tops of towerblocks in central Beijing were barely visible on Monday morning, and commuters could be seen wearing improvised headwear to protect their faces and hair. 
""It looks like the end of the world,"" said Beijing resident Flora Zou, 25, who works in the fashion sector. ""In this kind of weather I really, really don't want to be outside."" 
Heavy sandstorms also hit neighbouring Mongolia, with at least 341 people reported missing, according to China's state news agency Xinhua.
Flights have been grounded out of Hohhot, capital of China's Inner Mongolia.
Around a fifth of the incoming and outbound flights at Beijing Capital International Airport and Beijing Daxing International Airport had been cancelled as of noon (0400 GMT), more than usual during the sandstorm season, according to aviation data provider Variflight. 
The sandstorms were expected to shift south towards the Yangtze River delta and should clear by Wednesday or Thursday, the environment ministry said. 
Beijing faces regular sandstorms in March and April due to its proximity to the massive Gobi desert as well as deforestation and soil erosion throughout northern China. 
China has been trying to reforest and restore the ecology of the region to limit how much sand is blown into the capital. 
Beijing has planted a ""great green wall"" of trees to trap incoming dust, and has also tried to create air corridors that channel the wind and allow sand and other pollutants to pass through more quickly.
The environment ministry said last year that the situation had improved, with the first storms now arriving much later in the year and not lasting as long as they did a decade ago.
Beijing and surrounding regions have suffered from high levels of pollution in recent weeks, with the city shrouded in smog during the national session of parliament which began on March 5.

""It's hard to claim we are moving forward when you can't see what's in front,"" Li Shuo, climate advisor with Greenpeace in Beijing, tweeted on Monday.

CANBERRA/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of women gathered outside Australia's parliament and across the country on Monday, calling for gender equality and justice for victims of sexual assault. 
The March 4 Justice rallies were spurred by a recent wave of allegations of sexual abuse, discrimination and misconduct in some of Australia's highest political offices.
Women wore black to signal ""strength and mourning"" and chanted ""We will not be silenced"". Protestors in Melbourne carried a metres-long white banner bearing the names of women killed in Australia from gendered violence since 2008, while those outside Parliament House in Canberra prepared to deliver two petitions demanding change. 
While leaders of the major opposition political parties came out to join the crowds in Canberra, a delegation of organisers rejected an invitation to meet with Prime Minister Scott Morrison in private.
""We've come to his front garden,"" Janine Hendry, one of the organisers, told Reuters. ""We are 200 metres from his office and it's not appropriate for us to meet behind closed doors especially when we are talking about sexual assault which does happen behind closed doors.""
Recently reported scandals include a rape allegation against Attorney-General Christian Porter, who has strongly denied the alleged 1988 assault.
Porter lodged defamation proceedings in Australia's Federal Court on Monday against the Australian Broadcasting Corp over a news article on the alleged rape. The ABC did not immediately respond to the legal action.
A former senior political adviser for Morrison's Liberal Party has also been accused by several women of rape or sexual assault. The man has not been named, nor commented publicly on the allegations.
The public anger over the government's handling of the alleged incidents mirrors the sentiment on display at protests in London over the weekend following the killing of 33-year-old Sarah Everard, who disappeared while walking home at night-time.
Morrison had been enjoying strong public approval ratings, chiefly for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, but a Newspoll conducted for The Australian newspaper published on Sunday showed the centre-left Labor party has pulled ahead of Morrison's Liberal-led coalition on a two-party preferred basis.
Morrison said Australia had made big strides toward gender equality over the years, though he acknowledged the job was ""far from done"" and he shared the concerns of the protestors.
However, he raised some hackles by expressing pride in the right to peaceful protest: ""Not far from here, such marches, even now, are being met with bullets, but not in this country."" 
Among the gatherings, protestors in the seaside town of Torquay lined up on the beach to form the word ""justice"".
""The start of the solution is quite simple – making noise,"" Grace Tame, a sexual assault survivor and advocate who was named Australian of the Year, told the crowd in Tasmania.
CORRIDORS OF POWER 
The politically charged assault allegations are expected to dominate parliamentary proceedings in coming days. Both Porter and Defence Minister Linda Reynolds - who has been criticised for failing to report an alleged rape of one of her former staff members by another - are both on sick leave.
Reynolds on Friday apologised ""unreservedly"" and reached a financial settlement with her former staff member Brittany Higgins over the latter's allegation of rape by the unnamed former Liberal employee in Parliament House. Reynolds had called Higgins a ""lying cow"" in front of staff, a comment she said referred to comments by Higgins about her treatment after the alleged assault, not the attack itself.
Higgins told the gathering in Canberra she hoped to bring about changes to workplace culture to ""ensure the next generation of women can benefit from a safer and more equitable Australia.""
Deirdre Heitmeyer, 68, said she drove for more than six hours to attend the protest.

""I can't believe we have to still do this,"" she told Reuters. ""We were out in the 1970s calling for equality and we are still here.""

Armed with high-capacity semi-automatic weapons, Australian Brenton Tarrant killed 51 people and injured dozens when he opened fire on Muslim worshippers on March 15, 2019.
Tarrant released a racist manifesto shortly before the attack and streamed the shootings live on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The attack sparked a global debate about the threat of white supremacy. 
""The world needs to have these conversations,"" Ardern said in a news conference.
""In the aftermath of the attack it was incumbent on New Zealand to get its house in order,"" she said, adding that it was not fair to say that because the terrorist came from Australia, that New Zealand didn't have a responsibility. 
""Members of our Muslim community were experiencing some pretty horrific racism before that attack here in their own communities.""
Ardern said every global leader has a responsibility as their voice can be broadcast anywhere, at any time. 
""Countries need to take that into account,"" she said.
Ardern apologised last year after a royal commission of inquiry into the country’s worst massacre found that security agencies were almost exclusively focused on the perceived threat of Islamist terrorism before the attack. 
Ardern said a NZ$1 million ($719,800) community engagement response fund had been established for community groups to engage with the Royal Commission. A slew of other measures were also announced for the community.
When asked if New Zealand was a much safer place for Muslims now compared to two years ago, Ardern said: ""I am not the one to answer that, only our Muslim community can. But I can say right now, there's still work to be done.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will name Gene Sperling to lead implementation of the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan, one of the largest economic stimulus measures in American history, an administration official said on Sunday.
Sperling, a top economic adviser to former Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, was ideally suited for the job given his experience in creating jobs and boosting economic growth following previous downturns, the official said.
""There’s no one who knows how the federal government works better than Gene Sperling, and there’s no one better qualified to take charge of the implementation of the rescue plan and make sure it delivers for the American people,"" the official said.
Sperling did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
A White House announcement could come as early as Monday, according to Politico, which first said Sperling was being considered for the job earlier on Sunday.
Biden signed the hugely popular relief program into law on Thursday, promising that it would aid the recovery of the U.S. economy after a recession in 2020 caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The president and other top U.S. officials will travel around the country starting this week to laud and explain the legislation.
The bill provides $400 billion for direct payments of $1,400 to most Americans, aid of $350 billion to state and local governments, an expansion of the child tax credit and more funds to distribute vaccines.
Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning think tank, said Sperling would be ""a great influence on policy decisions that may very well determine the future of this country for decades.""
In his book ""Economic Dignity"" published last year, Sperling called for a new approach that emphasizes the nature and quality of work and gives people a renewed sense of meaning and security, instead of focusing solely on metrics such as GDP.
Sperling, who served as an economic adviser for Biden's presidential campaign, is the only person who headed the White House National Economic Council under two presidents.From 2009 to 2011, he served as a counsel to then Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, as the Obama administration responded to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.
""He has a track record of translating complex policies into tangible results for working and middle-class families,"" said the administration official.
In his new role, Sperling will work with the heads of the White House policy councils and leaders of federal agencies to ensure swift adoption of the relief package, the official said.

Biden, who played a similar role while serving as vice president under Obama, has vowed ""extreme vigilance"" to avoid the types of fraud seen with COVID-19 relief funds seen during the Trump administration.

China's embassy said many Chinese staff were injured and trapped in arson attacks on Sunday by unidentified assailants on garment factories in the Yangon suburb of Hlaingthaya, and that it had called on Myanmar to protect Chinese property and citizens.
China is viewed as being supportive of the military junta that took power in Myanmar, overthrowing the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.
Taiwan is home to a large Sino-Burmese population and there are close cultural and business links.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said on Monday only one Taiwanese company was caught up in the violence, with 10 of its nationals trapped inside the premises though they were safe.
It said Taiwan's representative office in the country had got in touch with Taiwanese firms after receiving reports of the attacks on Chinese-invested firms.
The office ""suggested Taiwanese businesspeople hang signs in Burmese reading 'Taiwanese company' at their factories and to hang our country's national flag, and explain to local workers and neighbours they are a Taiwanese factory, to avoid outsiders getting confused and misjudging"".
Taiwanese firms in Southeast Asia have been confused for Chinese ones in protests before, including in 2014 when thousands of Vietnamese set fire to foreign factories in an angry reaction to Chinese oil drilling in a part of the South China Sea claimed by Vietnam.
China claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory. Taipei maintains no official relations with Myanmar, which formally considers the island part of China.

The 22 demonstrators deny charges of committing sedition and a litany of other offences, which includes lese majeste, a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison for each count.
""They can lock me up but they cannot lock up the truth,"" protest leader Parit ""Penguin"" Chiwarak shouted as he arrived in a prison truck, defiantly flashing the three-finger ""Hunger Games"" salute synonymous with the youth movement.
""The truth is always the truth whether in prison, under torture or awaiting execution, the truth is the truth,"" said Parit, 22, who is among seven defendants held in pre-trial detention and accused of insulting King Maha Vajiralongkorn, as well as sedition. 
Thailand's youth movement has posed the biggest challenge so far to prime minister and former coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha, who they say engineered a process that would preserve the political status quo and keep him in power after a 2019 election. Prayuth has rejected that. 
Protesters also broke a traditional taboo by demanding reform of the powerful monarchy, saying the constitution drafted by the military after the 2014 coup gives the king too much power.

The length of the trial will be determined later on Monday after the defence and prosecution discuss how many witnesses both sides will call upon for the case, which stems from a September rally.

The United States has expressed concern at Beijing's efforts to win over the remaining 15 countries which still have formal ties with Taipei and expand Chinese influence, especially in Latin America which Washington traditionally views as its backyard.
Paraguay had kept infections very low early last year but COVID-19 cases have jumped since September and vaccines have been slow to arrive, though Chile donated around 20,000 doses of the Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine to Paraguay this month.
Paraguay's Senate last week approved a declaration of support for a plan to use $12.8 million in funds given by Taiwan for a housing development project to be used to buy 2 million vaccine doses.
Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said Taiwan and Paraguay have a ""solid friendship"".

""Our government will continue to uphold the spirit of pulling together in times of trouble and trying our best to assist allies to fight the pandemic together within the scope of our capabilities,"" she said.

Some are opting to have ""Freedom from Fear"" or ""Spring Revolution"" written on their bodies, while others favour drawings of ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi's face or the movement's three-finger salute.
These motifs have become increasingly popular since the junta seized power on Feb. 1, tattoo parlours say. More than 80 people have been killed and 2,100 arrested in the crackdown by police and security forces on daily protests across the Southeast Asian nation, an advocacy group says.
""I felt like I lost my future when I heard the news on Feb 1. I feel so much in pain and I don't want to get to forget that pain ever,"" said a 23-year old woman at a parlour in Yangon, who did not want to be identified.
She said she was getting the message ""Freedom from Fear"" written on her body so she would never forget that pain and to show younger generations ""how we got rid of this system.""
Many tattoo artists inked people for free in a show of solidarity in the days after the coup in early February. After reports that some of them were arrested, many parlours are trying to be more discreet even though they continue to offer steep discounts.
""They threatened us with the weapons. But our revolution won't win if we have fear,"" said the customer in Yangon. ""So we must get rid of this kind of fear to prevail in our revolution.""

The leaders of the United States and some of its allies vowed on Friday to work together to restore democracy in Myanmar.

Ties between Scotland and the rest of Britain have been badly strained by a much-criticised COVID-19 pandemic response and Brexit, which a majority in Scotland opposed. 
That has worsened for many Scottish the sense that policies designed in London don't represent their views and make their day-to-day lives harder.
The cabinet office, which oversees the running of the government machine, said it was creating a new headquarters in Glasgow, while the foreign office planned to create 500 new jobs at an existing office in East Kilbride. 
""Not only will this bring new jobs and investment to Scotland, it will strengthen the diversity of the UK civil service, ending the Westminster knows best approach to policymaking and ensuring Scottish voices shape everything we do,"" Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said in a statement.
In total 1,000 more jobs would be located in Scotland over the next four years. The exact functions to be shifted to Scotland were not set out.
More of the government's 400,000-plus employees are based in London than any other city, although there has been a long-term push to locate more of these jobs elsewhere to challenge the perception of London-centric policymaking. 
Polls show more people in Scotland support independence than want to remain part of Britain.
Scottish nationalists are pushing for an independence referendum to be held after this May's Scottish parliament election, but British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said such votes should happen only once in a generation.

In a referendum in 2014, Scots voted 55%-45% to remain in the United Kingdom.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Three days of voting begins in the Netherlands on Monday in a parliamentary election seen as a referendum on the Dutch government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Prime Minister Mark Rutte, one of Europe's longest-serving leaders, is widely expected to gain enough support to secure a fourth term.
Four polls released this week showed Rutte's conservative VVD taking 21-26% of the vote, compared with 11-16% for its closest rival, Geert Wilders' anti-Islam Freedom Party, which leads the parliamentary opposition.
With a ban on public gatherings, the election campaign focused on a series of televised debates in which Rutte maintained his image as a steady hand during a time of crisis.
But coronavirus infections in the Netherlands are rising at the fastest pace in months, and the National Institute for Health (RIVM) has advised against any swift easing out of lockdown, saying that hospitals could still be overwhelmed in a third wave of the pandemic driven by more contagious variants.
On Sunday, police broke up thousands of demonstrators gathered in The Hague to protest against the lockdown and curfew, the imposition of which prompted several days of riots in January.
Roughly 13 million voters are eligible to pick from dozens of parties contesting spots in the 150-seat parliament. Voting booths open at 0630 GMT and the first exit poll is expected when they close at 2000 GMT on Wednesday.
Major parties including Labour, the Green-Left, the pro-education Democrats-66 are vying with the centre-right Christian Democrats for third place. Two or three of these will likely join a new VVD-led coalition.
With a ban on gatherings of more than two people, restaurants and bars shut and the first night-time curfew since World War Two, voting has been spread over three days to help ensure social distancing at polling stations.
An exception on the 9 p.m. curfew will be made for people out casting their ballots.
Rutte, 54, has been Dutch prime minister since 2010. 

Although the Netherlands slipped up in its response to COVID-19, being last in the E.U. to start vaccinating and flip-flopping over face masks, hospitals never ran out of beds through two COVID-19 infection peaks.

The United States, France and Germany - three of the world's biggest exporters - increased deliveries, but falls in exports from Russian and China offset the rise, SIPRI said.
It was the first time since 2001–2005 that the volume of deliveries of major arms between countries - an indicator of demand - did not increase from the previous five year period, SIPRI said.
While the pandemic has shut down economies across the world and pushed many countries into deep recessions, SIPRI said it was too early to tell whether the slowdown in arms deliveries was likely to continue.
""The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could see some countries reassessing their arms imports in the coming years,"" Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure Programme, said in a statement.
""However, at the same time, even at the height of the pandemic in 2020, several countries signed large contracts for major arms.""
The United Arab Emirates, for example, recently signed an agreement with the United States to purchase 50 F-35 jets and up to 18 armed drones as part of a $23 billion package.
Middle Eastern countries accounted for the biggest increase in arms imports, up 25% in 2016–20 from 2011–15. 
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest arms importer, increased its arms imports by 61% and Qatar by 361%. 
Asia and Oceania were the largest importing regions for major arms, receiving 42% of global arms transfers in 2016–20. India, Australia, China, South Korea and Pakistan were the biggest importers in the region.

""For many states in Asia and Oceania, a growing perception of China as a threat is the main driver for arms imports,"" said Siemon Wezeman, Senior Researcher at SIPRI, said.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Protests erupted across many of Jordan's cities and provincial towns against the government's coronavirus restrictions, a day after oxygen ran out at a state hospital leading to the deaths of at least six COVID-19 patients, witnesses said on Sunday.
Hundreds of people spilled into the streets in defiance of a night curfew in the northern city of Irbid and several other provincial cities including a neighbourhood in the capital and the city of Salt. Protesters also gathered further south in Karak city and the port city of Aqaba.
""Down with the government. We don't fear coronavirus,"" hundreds of youths chanted in Irbid where outrage at the hospital scandal combined with anger over tighter restrictions that include extending a night curfew to stem a major surge of infections driven by a more contagious variant of the virus. 
Jordan's economy has been particularly hard hit by the shutdowns aimed at containing the virus with unemployment surging to a record 24 % and poverty deepening. It witnessed its worst contraction in decades last year.
Demonstrators who blamed the government for worsening economic conditions also called for an end to draconian emergency laws enacted at the start of the pandemic last year used to limit civil and political rights.
Prime Minister Bisher al Khasawneh fired the health minister and said he bore full responsibility for the initial deaths of six coronavirus patients that exposed gross negligence in the state health system when medical staff failed to act after oxygen ran out for two hours.
King Abdullah visited the hospital in Salt, a city west of the Jordanian capital of Amman, in a move officials said was intended to defuse tensions. Anger with the authorities over worsening living standards, corruption has in the past triggered civil unrest in Jordan.
The authorities detained the hospital head and their aides Saturday evening with officials saying another three deaths could be linked to the rupture in oxygen supplies.

""I am here because of the catastrophe. We want to put on trial those responsible for this and then bring down the government,"" said Ahmad Hiyari, a demonstrator near Salt hospital among hundreds of angry residents.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's former president Jeanine Anez on Sunday appeared via videolink for a first hearing before a judge over accusations she helped foment a coup against the country's socialist government. 
During the hearing, Anez and her former ministers of energy and justice, Rodrigo Guzman and Alvaro Coimbra, were accused of sedition, terrorism and conspiracy. 
Public prosecutor Harold Jarandilla said the defendants used security force allies to push then-President Evo Morales to resign after contested elections and ""rigged"" events in the political vacuum that followed to install her as interim president. 
Jarandilla said Anez posed a flight risk since she was discovered ""skillfully hidden"" in a neighbor's home in the central city of Trinidad during a police raid on Saturday, and he called for her and her ministers to be held on remand pending trial for six months. 
According to an arrest warrant seen by Reuters, several other ministers from the Anez government are also sought along with police, military and opposition figures. 
The crackdown on former members of her conservative administration represents a sharp change of direction by Morales' former economy minister, President Luis Arce, who pledged to ""rebuild and stabilize"" the country when he led the Movement for Socialism back into office in October. 
It has sparked fury among opposition leaders who have called for a civil uprising against a ""dictatorship"", and expressions of concern from rights groups and global powers. 
Both the United States and the European Union issued statements over the weekend urging Bolivia to follow due process and ensure prosecutions were carried out without political interference, a call echoed by rights groups including the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and the office in Bolivia of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
The Bolivian Episcopal Conference (CEB) called for the immediate release of those detained. 
""The politics of revenge and resentment and a justice system dependent on political power do not create trust in the people and will harm us all, sooner or later,"" the CEB said in a statement issued late on Saturday. 
ARMED GROUP 
Anez, 53, a lawyer and former senator for the centre-right Democrat Social Movement took power after Morales resigned amid widespread violent protests and claims backed by international organizations that he fraudulently won the election. 
At least 33 people were killed in violence that followed the election, 30 of them after Anez took office.
Anez has rejected the charges as ""political persecution"" and insisted she took part in a ""constitutional succession"" to replace Morales after he stepped down. 
She has appealed to the Organization of American States and the European Union to send observers to evaluate the prosecutions of her and her colleagues, and has said she should benefit from immunity as a former president.
The arrests continued on Sunday with the detention of Yassir Molina, a community leader of the Cochala Youth Resistance group whose often masked members protested against Morales and celebrated Anez's succession with fireworks. 
Eduardo del Castillo, the minister of government, told a press conference that the movement had been classified by the IACHR as an ""armed group."" 
""He will be investigated for the crimes of criminal organization, possession, carrying and use of conventional firearms, attack against public property and deprivation of liberty, among others,"" he said. 

Andronico Rodriguez, president of Bolivia's Chamber of Senators and a senior figure in the ruling party, said the group had ""exercised violence without measure, sown terror and fear before the population, and must be held accountable.""

The French government has so far resisted pressure from some health experts to impose a new, third lockdown in the face of rising case numbers.
Instead it has imposed a 6 p.m. nationwide curfew and weekend lockdowns in two regions struggling to contain outbreaks while big shopping centres have been required to close.
""We have to use all weapons available to avoid a lockdown. I've never hid it, let's vaccinate, protect ourselves, get tested,"" Castex said in an interview on website Twitch.
The health ministry reported on Sunday 26,343 new COVID-19 cases, down from 29,759 the previous day, while the number people who have died from the virus rose by 140 to a total 90,429. 
Meanwhile, the number of people in intensive care units edged higher by 57 to 4,127, while emergency resuscitation units were running at nearly 82% of capacity, the highest since late November when France was in its second lockdown.
""The situation is not getting better, there is a higher and higher number of infections and hospitals are very burdened with many patients, whose average age is getting lower and who don't always have comorbidities,"" Castex said. 
The government plans to transfer about 100 patients this week by air or special trains from the greater Paris region to other cities to help to ease pressure on hospitals in the capital. 
Labour Minister Elizabeth Borne said on Sunday she had tested positive for COVID-19 and would keep working, the latest senior French official to catch the virus.

Meanwhile, France's vaccination programme has been gaining speed with the 67,134 first shots on Sunday bringing the total to 5,128,872 or 7.7% of the population, the health ministry said. Some 2,239,389 have received both injections as of Sunday.

Security across Nigeria has been deteriorating in recent months, including in the northeast.
Four attacks claimed the lives of at least 27 soldiers and 10 members of the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF), including a unit head, the sources told Reuters.
CJTF are local groups of armed men who protect the areas where they live, mainly against Islamist insurgents. They are not members of the military but often fight alongside soldiers. 
Neither Army nor defence headquarters spokesmen took calls or responded to messages requesting comment. 
Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), the regional affiliate of Islamic State, claimed credit for a Friday attack in Monguno, via its Amaq news agency on Saturday. 
ISWAP said it had killed 33 soldiers and captured one. Two military sources and one CJTF fighter said the attack, which took place between Monguno and Kukawa, had killed between 11 and 15 soldiers, with several still missing. Four CJTF fighters were also killed.
Soldiers also killed eight militants in fighting in Gamdu on Wednesday, the sources said. 
A more than decade-long Islamist insurgency in northeast Nigeria waged by Boko Haram and later ISWAP has displaced about 2 million people and killed more than 30,000.
In Kaduna state in northwest Nigeria, armed men attempted to kidnap more students, a state government official said, as 39 others from an earlier attack remain missing. Four school kidnappings since December have provoked nationwide outrage.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ireland is counting on U.S. support to help maintain the political stability of Northern Ireland as Britain withdraws from the European Union, Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin said on Sunday ahead of a virtual summit with President Joe Biden. 
""We want to see a continuation of the president's interest in Ireland and support for the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and also of upholding the Brexit agreement itself,"" Martin said in an interview with CBS' ""Face the Nation"" program. 
Martin and Biden, an Irish-American, will hold a virtual summit on Wednesday to mark St. Patrick's Day and the close bilateral relationship between Washington and Dublin.
The Good Friday or Belfast Agreement, Northern Ireland's 1998 peace deal, ended three decades of violence between mostly Catholic nationalists fighting for a united Ireland and mostly Protestant unionists, or loyalists, who want Northern Ireland to stay part of the United Kingdom. 
Martin declined to discuss his plans for Wednesday's discussion in detail, including whether he would ask Biden to exert influence on Britain, as Dublin seeks what he described as ""a stronger structure"" for British-Irish relations in the aftermath of Brexit. 
Asked about the possibility Biden could visit Ireland in June, Martin said the U.S. president told him in November: ""Try and keep me out."" 
Earlier this month, Northern Irish loyalist paramilitary groups said they were temporarily withdrawing support for the 1998 peace agreement due to concerns over the Brexit deal. The groups expressed concern about a disruption to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland due to the Brexit deal and said they believed that Britain, Ireland and the EU had breached their commitments to the peace deal. 
""I get on well with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and we will be working out issues post-Brexit,"" Martin said. 
He also noted the longstanding role that Washington has played in Northern Ireland. 
""Having been involved at the time of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, I'm under no illusions about the significance of the American involvement and engagement with all sides,"" Martin told CBS. 

He and Biden are also expected to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic including vaccines and other global challenges.

Shoukry confirmed contacts between Cairo and Ankara after years of tensions but indicated that dialogue was limited.
Relations have been frosty since Egypt's army ousted Mohammed Mursi, who was the country's first democratically elected president and an ally of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, following protests in 2013.
""(There is) no communication outside the normal diplomatic framework. If real actions from Turkey show alignment with Egyptian principles and goals then the groundwork will be laid for relations to return to normal,"" Shoukry said.
Top Turkish officials said last week that diplomatic contacts had resumed and that Ankara was seeking further cooperation. Erdogan said contacts were ""not at the highest level, but right below the highest level"".
Egyptian intelligence sources said Turkey had proposed a meeting to discuss cooperation. 
Any thaw in ties between the two regional powerhouses could have repercussions around the Middle East, where Cairo and Ankara have sought to influence events in various hotspots and stand on opposing sides in a Mediterranean maritime dispute.
Shoukry also told lawmakers there were positive messages from Qatar indicating a desire to further repair relations following a summit in Saudia Arabia's al-Ula in January.

Egypt and its Gulf allies Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain agreed at the summit to restore diplomatic, trade and travel ties with Doha, which had been severed in 2017 over allegations Qatar supported terrorism, a charge it denies.

The region, around the northern city of Turin, had initially suspended all AstraZeneca vaccines in order to identify and isolate the batch from which the jab administered to the teacher, from the town of Biella, came. 
The decision, following similar moves elsewhere in Europe, was precautionary and the region is awaiting the results of checks which will verify whether there is a connection between the death and the vaccination, the regional government said in an online statement.
The statement did not specify what batch it had banned nor did it say how the teacher died. Italian newspapers reported it was batch ABV5811. A source close to the regional government confirmed it was batch ABV5811.
The regional government's statement said that the Piedmont region was also awaiting decisions from Italy's medicine's agency Aifa and a regional health commission on the issue. 
""It is an act of extreme prudence, while we verify whether there is a connection. There have been no critical issues with the administration of vaccines to date,"" Luigi Genesio Icardi, head of regional health services, said in the statement.
Italy's medicine authority Aifa on Thursday banned the use of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine belonging to the ABV2856 batch. Sources told Reuters the decision had been taken after the deaths of two men in Sicily.
Aifa had said that the ban was precautionary, adding that no link had been established between the vaccine and subsequent ""serious adverse events"".
Authorities in Denmark, Norway and Iceland have suspended the use of the vaccine over blood clotting issues, while Austria stopped using a batch of AstraZeneca shots last week while investigating a death from coagulation disorders.
The European Medicines Agency has said there is no indication that the events were caused by the vaccination, a view that was echoed by the World Health Organisation on Friday. AstraZeneca also said it had found no evidence of increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis.
Ireland also temporarily suspended AstraZeneca's vaccine ""out of an abundance of caution"" on Sunday, citing reports from the Norwegian Medicines Agency regarding a cluster of serious blood clotting in some recipients there. 

Earlier on Sunday, Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza said vaccines in Italy and Europe were ""effective and safe"", with all checks being carried out, when asked in an interview about the ban.

The demonstration was broken up after the protesters flouted social distancing rules and ignored police warnings to disperse.
Local media said several arrests were made during the clashes. There were no immediate reports of injuries. 
Dutch authorities had stopped train services to the city, the seat of government, to prevent more protesters arriving. Police initially told people to go home and announced over loudspeakers that the event was over and warned that they would break up the protest by force if necessary.
Many in the crowd, gathered at the central Maliveld field in the city, were holding yellow umbrellas in a show of opposition and chanted ""Love, freedom, stop dictatorship.""
The Netherlands has been under a tough lockdown since late January with gatherings of more than two people banned, restaurants and bars shut and with the first night-time curfew since World War Two.
Voting in the election will start on Monday, with polls open for three days to help to ensure social distancing at polling stations. Prime Minister Mark Rutte's conservative VVD Party looks set to get a new four-year mandate after being in power since 2010.
A majority of voters reluctantly support the lockdown, given the Netherlands' current coronavirus infection rate which is towards the high end of Europe's range.
But the curfew, which has been extended until the end of March, prompted several days of rioting across the country when it was first imposed on Jan. 23

Kosovo's Foreign Ministry said on Twitter that with the embassy's opening, ""the pledge given in the Oval Office today is finally fulfilled"".
Israel sees its new ties with Kosovo as part of its broader normalisation with Arab and Muslim countries under agreements sponsored by former U.S. President Donald Trump.

No date was immediately announced for a formal opening ceremony.
On Thursday, the Czech Republic opened a diplomatic office in Jerusalem, a branch of its embassy in Tel Aviv, a move that drew condemnation from the Palestinians and Arab League.
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to forging a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, who with broad international backing want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, as their capital.
Israel annexed East Jerusalem after the 1967 conflict in a move that has not won international recognition.

The U.S. envoy to Yemen said on Friday that a ""sound plan"" for a nationwide truce had been before Houthi leadership for ""a number of days"" but that it appeared the group was prioritising its military offensive in Marib, the government's last stronghold.
Military sources told Reuters fighting in Marib had eased on Sunday.
The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression. The Yemeni government and the Saudi-led coalition say the Houthis are backed by Riyadh's rival Iran.

660,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2021 10:40AM ET</span>",Former Italian PM Letta takes helm of fractious Democrats,"ROME (Reuters) - Former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta urged the Democratic Party (PD) to end infighting and come together before the next national election as he took up the leadership of the troubled centre-left group on Sunday.
His appointment comes after former party secretary Nicola Zingaretti quit abruptly saying he was ""ashamed"" of internal wrangling, leaving the PD, which supports Mario Draghi's national unity government, in turmoil.
""Our politics should be summarised in two terms that seem very far from each other: soul and screwdriver"", Letta, 54, said in his speech before his appointment as party secretary. 
""We need to put them together and never take them apart. If we only put our soul, our ideas will never make progress"". 
With 860 votes in favour, 2 against and 4 abstained, Letta, the only candidate for the position, becomes the ninth leader of the PD, which he helped to found in 2007. 
He returns to frontline politics after heading a coalition in 2013-2014 that combined centre-left and centre-right parties and from which he was booted out of office by party rival Matteo Renzi.
In his hour-long speech, in which he cited Pope Francis and French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, Letta called on the party to renew itself, opening its doors to possible future alliances, and ridding itself of internal politics. 
The party has in recent years struggled, losing touch with its voters and ceding ground to centre-right groups in regions where it was historically deep-rooted. It has also been weakened by the infighting.
""We are the engine of the Draghi government and we must prepare what comes after, when we will go to elections, and we have to build a new centre-left, with the initiative and the leadership of the PD,"" Letta said.
He said he would talk to all leftist and centrist parties, including the 5-Star Movement, in coming weeks. 
A moderate and a pro-European, Letta said his agenda would focus on the unemployed, women, and youth. 

He said he would work to lower the right to vote age to 16, from the current 18 - and would push for a controversial law granting citizenship to children who were born in Italy to foreign parents of immigrants to be proposed again in parliament.

LONDON (Reuters) - London police faced a backlash from the public and politicians on Sunday for their heavy-handed tactics in breaking up an outdoor vigil for a woman whose suspected killer is a police officer.
The disappearance of Sarah Everard, 33, as she walked home on the evening of March 3, has provoked a huge outpouring of grief and dismay in Britain at the failure of police and wider society to tackle violence against women. 
Police had denied permission for a vigil on Saturday evening at London's Clapham Common, near where Everard was last seen alive, citing regulations aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus. 
But hundreds of people, mostly women, gathered peacefully at the park in defiance of the ban to pay their respects to Everard throughout the day, including Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge. 
Late on Saturday dozens of police officers marched into the crowd to shouts of ""shame on you"". Scuffles broke out and officers dragged women away from the scene.
""Last night people were very, very upset, there was a great deal of emotion, completely understandably, and the police, being as they are operationally independent, will be having to explain that to the Home Secretary,"" safeguarding minister Victoria Atkins told Sky News.
Home Secretary Priti Patel, the minister in charge of policing, described footage of the incident as ""upsetting"" and said she had asked police for a full report on what happened.
An image of officers handcuffing a woman as she lay on the floor was widely shared and condemned on social media.
The woman, Patsy Stevenson, told LBC radio: ""The main point that everyone was trying to get across when everything happened is that women don't feel safe, they don't feel safe walking down a street and that's the bare minimum we should feel the freedom to do."" 
She said she was fined 200 pounds for breaching COVID regulations
A steady flow of quiet mourners visited the site of the vigil on Sunday, placing flowers around a bandstand.
""I feel very angry that they think that they have the right to dictate how we mourn and how we react,"" 24-year old student Lilith Blackwell told Reuters at the bandstand.
Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball (NYSE:BLL) defended the officers' actions and said they were faced with a very difficult decision.
""Hundreds of people were packed tightly together, posing a very real risk of easily transmitting Covid-19,"" she said.
A police officer charged with Everard's murder and appeared in court on Saturday. Police discovered her body on Wednesday in woodland about 50 miles (80 km) southeast of London. The court heard that her body was found in a builder's refuse bag, and identified using dental records..

Everard's murder has resonated with woman across the country, prompting thousands to share on social media their experiences of violence and sexual assaults perpetrated by men, and vividly describe the daily fear they feel.

One week on from the blasts that killed at least 107 and wounded hundreds, the father-of-seven, who was not at his home at the time of the blasts, recalled his relief.
""By some miracle, my children were able to get out of the furnace and save themselves,"" he said, describing how the shockwave caused a fire that tore through the apartment building where he and his family lived.
Now they are among the 900 people being housed in temporary shelter, including unaccompanied children that have lost their families, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has said.
Every district in the coastal city of around 250,000 people shows signs of damage from the explosions at an army barracks which destroyed hundreds of buildings, blew off roofs and toppled trees.
The government has blamed the disaster on negligent handling of dynamite stored at the base, and on fires set by farmers living nearby. President Teodoro Obiang Nguema has promised to bring those responsible to account.
It is the Central African country's worst tragedy in recent memory. The former Spanish colony has been run by president Nguema, Africa's longest-serving leader, since 1979.
Survivors are still reeling from shock at the scale of destruction.
""When I got to the neighbourhood, I found everyone was traumatised,"" said Federico Faustino Nse, another Bata resident, recalling how he rushed home after hearing the blasts. 

""Today it's difficult to forget.""

Video showed protesters holding handmade shields and wearing helmets as they confronted security forces in the Hlaingthaya district of the city. Plumes of black smoke rose over the area.
Chinese state-owned broadcaster CGTN said two Chinese-funded clothes factories in the district were set ablaze by people who arrived on motorcycles, armed with iron rods, axes and gasoline.
More than 80 people had been killed and over 2,100 arrested as of Saturday in widespread protests against the military coup on Feb. 1, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group said.
Mahn Win Khaing Than, the acting leader of Myanmar's parallel civilian government, addressed the public via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Saturday, saying, ""This is the darkest moment of the nation and the moment that the dawn is close.""
The Irrawaddy media group said three people were killed when police opened fire on protesters in Yangon on Sunday. Myanmar Now said 15 people were also injured.
At least two people were killed elsewhere in the Southeast Asian nation, a day after Mahn Win Khaing Than, who is on the run along with most senior officials from the ruling National League for Democracy Party, said the civilian government would seek to give people the legal right to defend themselves.
A young man was shot and killed in the town of Bago, near Yangon, witnesses and domestic media said. The Kachin Wave media outlet said another protester was killed in the town of Hpakant, in the jade mining area in the northeast. 
The Monywa township in central Myanmar declared it had formed its own local government and police force. 
In Yangon, hundreds of people demonstrated in different parts of the city after putting up barricades of barbed wire and sandbags to block security forces. 
In one area, people staged a sit-in protest under sheets of tarpaulin rigged up to protect them from the harsh midday sun. ""We need justice,"" they chanted. 
At least 13 people were killed on Saturday, one of the bloodiest days since the coup, witnesses and domestic media said. 
""They are acting like they are in a war zone, with unarmed people,"" said Myat Thu, an activist in the city of Mandalay.

A spokesman for the junta did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment. Junta-run media MRTV's evening news broadcast on Saturday labelled the protesters ""criminals"" but did not elaborate.

KADUNA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Armed men attempted to kidnap more students in Nigeria's Kaduna state overnight on Sunday, a state government official said, as 39 others from an earlier attack remain missing. 
Attacks by armed gangs, usually referred to as bandits, have intensified across northwest Nigeria in recent years. Four school kidnappings since December have provoked nationwide outrage.
Some 39 students, including a pregnant woman, are still missing from Thursday's abduction from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization, in northwest Nigeria.
Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna state commissioner of internal security and home affairs, said police, army and others had repelled attacks on another school and at a local government office near Kaduna airport. 
""The Kaduna state government extends its unequivocal solidarity to the military, police, Department of State Services and other security agencies, whose swift intervention prevented the bandits from abducting more persons,"" Aruwan said. 
All 307 students at the Government Science Secondary School in Ikara were accounted for, Aruwan said, adding that the army and air force also repelled an attack on senior staff quarters in Ifira village in Igabi local government area. 
Aruwan did not refer to a video that circulated on Saturday of missing students from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization, showing them being beaten and cowering.
In that video, a college student said their captors wanted a 500 million naira ($1.3 million) ransom.
""As a government, our focus is on getting back our missing students and preventing further episodes of school abductions,"" Aruwan said. 
President Muhammadu Buhari, speaking in a video message posted on Twitter on Sunday, ordered states to tackle security issues at every level and said military service chiefs would quickly address broader security issues. 
""We are going to be very hard on the criminals,"" he said, adding that ""confidence must be restored in governance within the next six weeks.""

British foreign minister Dominic Raab said the second trial was ""unacceptable"" and called on Iran to let Zaghari-Ratcliffe return to Britain. He said Iran had subjected her to a ""cruel and disgraceful ordeal"".
Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation, was arrested in April 2016 and later convicted of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment.
Her family and the foundation, a charity that operates independently of media firm Thomson Reuters and its news subsidiary Reuters, deny the charge. 
The propaganda charge relates to her alleged participation in a rally in front of the Iranian Embassy in London in 2009 and giving interview to the BBC Persian TV channel at the same time, according to her lawyer Hojjat Kermani. 
After the trial on Sunday, Kermani said he expected the verdict within the next week. 
""Zaghari-Ratcliffe was fine and calm at the court session,"" he told Reuters. ""I am very hopeful that she will be acquitted.""
The Iranian Judiciary was not immediately available to comment. 
""OPEN-ENDED"" DETENTION
Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who served out most of her five-year sentence in Tehran's Evin prison, was released last March during the coronavirus pandemic and kept under house arrest until last Sunday. The authorities removed her ankle tag but immediately summoned her to court again on the other charge. 
Her husband Richard, who has set up the “Free Nazanin” campaign group and lobbied the British government to secure his wife’s release, said in a statement that ""at present, Nazanin’s future remains uncertain, and her detention effectively open ended"". 
Antonio Zappulla, CEO of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said in a statement that the second trial was a deliberate move to prolong her ordeal and her suffering.
""It is incomprehensible that she faces further trauma as punishment for crimes that she did not commit,"" he said. 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in a call with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe must be allowed to return home to her family.
Iranian media reported that during the call, Rouhani raised the issue of a historical debt of 400 million pounds ($557 million) which Tehran says Britain owes the Islamic Republic in capital and interest for a 1970s arms deal with the then-Shah of Iran.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Hondurans on Sunday will vote to choose candidates for November elections to replace outgoing President Juan Orlando Hernandez, whose eight years in power have been increasingly mired by corruption allegations.
The winning candidates in the primaries will compete in Nov. 28 elections to succeed the two-term president. Hernandez has denied corruption accusations, including by prosecutors in a U.S. trial that he worked with drug traffickers to move large quantities of cocaine into the United States.
An incoming administration will likely be under pressure from U.S. President Joe Biden to address issues contributing to migration, including violence, graft and climate change.
Some Hondurans said they had little hope a new government would bring a clean slate to the Central American country, as they must now choose from several other scandal-ridden candidates in the primaries.
Among the candidates are two men being investigated for alleged corruption and an ex-convict previously sentenced for money laundering in the United States.
""With whoever remains as president, we will continue in the same way: us poor and them - the politicians - rich,"" said Nestor Valle, a 47-year-old worker in ​​Tegucigalpa. 
""I am a nationalist (of the ruling National Party), but with what has come out that the candidates are accused of corruption, I am not going to vote,"" Valle said.
Two candidates from Hernandez's National Party, Congressional President Mauricio Oliva and Tegucigalpa Mayor Nasry Asfura, are under investigation for alleged misuse of public funds. They deny the accusations. 
From the center-right Liberal Party is candidate Yani Rosenthal, a former minister who served three years in a U.S. prison for laundering drug money.
Rosenthal has said the accusation of money laundering was withdrawn and he was eventually convicted of ""dealing with assets of illegitimate origin."" 
The leftist Liberty and Refoundation Party (LIBRE) has four other candidates, including Xiomara Castro, wife of former President Manuel Zelaya, who was ousted in a June 2009 coup. 
Results of the primary elections, in which 4.8 million Hondurans are eligible to vote, are expected next week. 
Biden has allocated $4 billion in aid for Central America over the next four years, but will drastically limit direct funding to the region's governments, top Biden aide Roberta Jacobson told the Los Angeles Times this week. 

A new Honduran government will also be tasked with reviving the economy after the coronavirus pandemic, with the poverty rate expected to hit 70%.

Dimitris Koufodinas, 63, a member of the dismantled November 17 guerrilla group, is being treated in intensive care in hospital near the high-security prison of Domokos in central Greece. He has refused food since Jan. 8, demanding to be transferred to Korydallos prison in Athens. 
In a message posted online on Sunday, Koufodinas thanked supporters for their solidarity, a statement his lawyer Ioanna Kourtovik confirmed meant that he was ending his hunger strike.
""He chooses life,"" Kourtovik told Reuters.
The decision resolves an increasingly sensitive problem for the conservative government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose own brother-in-law was killed by Koufodinas.
Sympathizers and civil rights activists, including members of the leftist opposition, have held a series of protests, accusing the government of intransigent and arbitrary treatment of Koufodinas. The government has rejected the criticism, saying it would not yield to blackmail.
Authorities had rejected Koufodinas' request for a transfer citing a recent prison reform and a rise in COVID-19 cases in the region of Korydallos, where he served part of his sentence and where other convicted members of the Marxist group are held. 
In his statement, Koufodinas, who suffered kidney failure last week, said protests in support of his strike showed the power of resistance.
""Before the force of these struggles, I declare that I'm among you, in heart and mind,"" he said. 
Over three decades, November 17, named for the date of a 1973 student uprising against the then junta, conducted a campaign of assassinations, targeting U.S. military personnel and foreign diplomats as well as Greek politicians and industrialists. 

Its leaders were arrested in 2002, two years before the Athens Olympic Games. In a high profile trial, Koufodinas, nicknamed ""Poison Hand"" for his cold-blooded killings, was convicted along with 14 others of 23 murders and dozens of bomb attacks, which he never denied.

AstraZeneca said on Friday it would try to deliver 30 million doses to the EU by the end of March, down from a contractual obligation of 90 million and a previous pledge made last month to deliver 40 million doses.
Breton told France's Europe 1 radio that the delay was unacceptable, but that for now there were no plans to sue the company.
""The good news is that even though there are delays with AstraZeneca we won't be late with our vaccination programme in the first quarter,"" Breton said.
""Pfizer is producing more, much more than planned and is going to deliver more to us,"" he added.
EU leaders have come under criticism for a slower rollout of vaccinations than in other countries such as Britain or the United States due to a longer approval and purchasing process and repeated delivery delays.
AstraZeneca's new lower supply target hinges on the bloc's drug regulator approving supplies from a factory in the Netherlands, an internal document showed, Reuters reported on Saturday.
Breton said that AstraZeneca had issues with testing, which were a sign of logistics problems, and urged its board of directors to take action.
He also criticized its French-born chief executive Pascal Soriot for remaining in Australia despite the problems, which he said meant he was able to visit the companies' plants when Soriot could not.

""I won't say that I know their factories better than them, but I'm on site,"" Breton said.

Spurred by rape allegations against Attorney-General Christian Porter and a former employee of Morrison's Liberal party, 43 protests are planned across the country on Monday to demand equality and justice for women. 
Porter denies the allegation, which surfaced recently, of the alleged 1988 rape.
A March4Justice rally is expected to gather several thousand people outside parliament in Canberra, the largest of the demonstrations that organisers predict will have about 85,000 people nationwide.
The protests will fuel pressure on Morrison, who will be without two members of his cabinet when parliament resumes on Monday.
""People who aren't interested in politics are engaged and angry and numbers are growing,"" said Haydon Manning, a political science professor at Flinders University in South Australia. ""Morrison can not afford for the issue to continue, he simply has to change the agenda.""
Seeking to placate rising anger, Morrison said on Sunday he would meet with a delegation, although he would not attend the protest.
The allegations involving people in Morrison's government are expected to dominate proceedings over the next two weeks, with Morrison also facing a depleted front bench.

Porter and Defence Minister Linda Reynolds - who has been criticised for falling to report the alleged rape by an unidentified former staff member - are both on sick leave.

Takaosan.
The fire-walking was more tense than usual because participants were required to wear masks and maintain social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic. The festival was also limited to 1,000 participants. Last year, it wasn't open to the public because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""Passing your body through the flames cleanses your soul and delivers your prayers to Buddha,"" said Koshou Kamimura, a Buddhist monk from Takaosan Yakuouin Temple.
""Historically, Mt. Takaosan is an important place to pray for deliverance from plagues, so I felt we should hold the festival this year with certain precautions."" 
The festival, called hiwatari matsuri in Japanese, has a history of about 50 years at Mt. Takaosan. 
The monks set fire to wood and Japanese cypress leaves, creating an intense bonfire. The monks then doused the flames with water, collected the embers and laid them out in two strips, over which they walked barefoot while chanting.
Worshippers followed the monks, wearing masks due to the coronavirus. Some monks carried small children over the embers as dark smoke billowed into the air. 
Tokyo is preparing to host the Summer Olympics this year, delayed from 2020 because of the coronavirus, with domestic opinion polls showing people favour limiting the number of spectators at the games. 
""Coronavirus infections are spreading globally, so I prayed that it doesn't spread any further,"" said Eriko Nakamura, 46, as Buddhist monks chanted in the background. 
""The fire-walking event is held outside and there are restrictions on the number of participants. When it comes to the Olympics, it will be held indoors, so I hope they can limit the number of spectators by half."" 

The number of coronavirus cases in Japan is relatively low compared to other countries such as the United States, although some areas including Tokyo are still under a state of emergency, with the country experiencing a third wave of the pandemic.

Italy, the first Western country hit hard by the pandemic, saw infections rise by 10% last week compared with the week earlier, and officials have warned that the situation is deteriorating as highly contagious variants gain ground.
""The application of more rigorous measures and the progressive rise in the number of vaccinated people make us think that already in the second half of spring (contagion) numbers will be improving,"" Health Minister Roberto Speranza told daily la Repubblica in an interview. 
He added that the coming weeks ""would not be at all easy"".
The UK variant represented 54% of cases in the latest study by Italy's Superior Health Institute, ISS, but the percentage was expected to be higher now, the minister added. 
On Friday the government imposed a nationwide lockdown over the Easter holidays and placed curbs on business and movement on most of Italy. 
Speranza said vaccines in Italy and Europe were ""effective and safe"", with all checks being carried out, answering a question on Italy's ban of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine. 
Italy's medicine authority Aifa on Thursday banned the use of one batch of the vaccine. Sources told Reuters the decision had been taken after the deaths of two men in Sicily. Aifa said earlier that the ban was a ""precautionary"" measure, adding that no link had been established between the vaccine and subsequent ""serious adverse events.""
Italy on Saturday released its national vaccination plan, aiming to vaccinate at least 80% of its population by the end of September and administer 500,000 doses a day at full capacity.
Speranza said that Italy is expecting the delivery of 52 million doses in the second quarter of the year and that the vaccination campaign would be accelerated even with further supply delays. 

So far, 6.6 million Italians have received at least one vaccine dose, with just under 2 million of them having received the required 2 doses, health ministry data shows.

BANGUI (Reuters) - Central African Republic voted at heavily guarded polling stations in a second round of parliamentary elections on Sunday after rebel violence marred December's polls.
Voting started smoothly with just slight delays across the capital Bangui, the electoral body said. Small lines of residents could be seen waiting to vote as large numbers of police and gendarmes stood by.
""So far in Bangui it's going well,"" National Elections Authority spokesman Théophile Momokoama said by phone.
Authorities are anxious to avoid a repeat of the turmoil surrounding December's vote when President Faustin Archange Touadéra won re-election, but rebels, who the United Nations say are backed by former president François Bozizé, sought to take control amid allegations of voting irregularities.
The insurgents laid siege to the capital Bangui in January, strangling food supplies, forcing more than 200,000 from their homes and raising concerns that the country was slipping back into the kind of sectarian conflict that has killed thousands over the past decade.
Sunday's vote included run-off votes in 49 electoral districts and first round voting in 69 districts where violence stopped the vote from taking place in December.
The government and the U.N. peacekeeping mission MINUSCA have both expressed confidence Sunday's election will be peaceful due to extra forces on the ground and the capture of rebel strongholds since their initial offensive. 
But the situation is far from stable in the gold- and diamond-rich nation of 4.7 million people that has seen repeated bouts of violence since Bozizé's ouster in 2013.
Low turnout in December due to insecurity prompted opposition candidates to dispute the legitimacy of the result. 
Retired teacher Bertrand Dena, 50, said he was reassured by the heavy police presence at his polling station in Bangui.

""When you vote, you want peace,"" he said.

Khatoun's account of the civil war, which Reuters could not independently verify, is not uncommon. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the fighting which began with protests that quickly turned violent in 2011.
Millions more, like Khatoun, have fled their homes for safer areas within Syria or as refugees abroad.
Assad has survived the insurgency, and now holds sway over many parts of the country, helped by Russia's military and Iran's Shi'ite militias. He is set to maintain power after a presidential election later this year.
Hostile Turkey still controls territory in the northwest where Khatoun is, while the United States has a presence in the northeast, a major oil and wheat producing area.
Despite the rebels' defeat and Assad's ascendancy, Khatoun remains defiant.
""Anyone with a brain will conclude that they have to oppose the (Assad) regime,"" he told Reuters in his tent, located in a large camp for internally displaced Syrians. ""I gave up my martyrs and I have no regrets.""
'I STILL THANK GOD'
When protests broke out in March 2011, Khatoun, now 84, and his sons were quick to join. Three of them were killed during the first year.
As the demonstrations turned into full-fledged conflict and some of them took up arms, he lost more.
Wearing a red headscarf and shedding tears as he spoke, Khatoun recalled coming across a video on his phone which he said showed the grisly execution of one of his sons.
Such footage was circulated regularly by pro-Assad forces early on in the conflict to intimidate the opposition, activists said.
""I was looking through the phone the other day and I came across the clip... My tears just started to fall, they were in the flower of youth and yet I've lost all of them. What more can I say?""
The Assad government denies that it tortures captives. Moscow and Damascus also deny accusations of indiscriminate bombing of civilians and say they only target radical militants.
After escaping to Idlib, Khatoun's war was not over.
Idlib was the last rebel bastion in the northwest of the country, and Syrian and Russian forces pounded the area between April, 2019 and March last year, killing hundreds of people and forcing more than a million people to flee.
During that assault, Khatoun was at a local rest house in Sarakeb when a missile struck, killing seven family members.
Granddaughter Fatima survived, however, and is one of 12 grandchildren who now live with the wives of his dead sons in the same camp.

""I used to be a farmer, a top one,"" he said, surrounded by the children who clambered on him affectionately. ""Now I have nothing, penniless. But I still thank God for everything.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian climate activist linked to Greta Thunberg said on Saturday she felt ""violated"" by her arrest last month on sedition charges and her treatment by the media, her first comments on a case that sparked international criticism. 
Disha Ravi, a 22-year-old vegan and member of Thunberg's Fridays for Future movement, was charged in February over an online document about months-long protests by Indian farmers. 
Ten days after her arrest and following widespread criticism, a court in India's capital New Delhi granted her bail, citing “scanty and sketchy evidence” that she was involved in fomenting violence. 
""I had coerced myself into believing that the only way I would be able to live through this was by tricking myself into thinking that this wasn't happening to me,"" Ravi said in a statement. 
""My actions were pronounced guilty - not in the court of law, but on flat screens.""
Police say the document Ravi created stoked violence on Jan. 26, India’s Republic Day, when some protesting farmers broke free of a planned march and clashed with police. 
Angry at new agricultural laws they say benefit large private buyers at the expense of growers, tens of thousands of farmers have been camped on the outskirts of New Delhi since late last year.

Swedish climate activist Thunberg, popstar Rihanna, and U.S. activist Meena Harris, the niece of Vice President Kamala Harris, all tweeted in support of the protests last month, drawing a rebuke from India's foreign ministry.

Chancellor Angela Merkel, in power since 2005, is not seeking re-election in September and her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is already missing the ""Merkel bonus"" she has brought them with four consecutive national election victories.
The CDU went into Sunday's polling in the southwestern auto hub of Baden-Wuerttemberg and the neighbouring wine-growing region of Rhineland-Palatinate with its poll numbers sliding, exacerbated by the face mask corruption scandal.
Support for the CDU at the national level slid to 31% this week, its lowest for almost a year, according to an opinion poll conducted by Kantar for the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, although the next strongest party, the Greens, was stuck on 19%.
While Merkel's government won plaudits last year for initially getting the coronavirus under control, it has faced mounting criticism due to the slow pace of vaccinations and a long lockdown as a third wave of infections now gathers pace.
About a thousand opponents of the lockdown protested outside the health ministry in Berlin on Saturday while dozens of cars drove in convoy through the city to demand a lifting of restrictions, plastered with slogans like ""Fear is contagious"".
In the once-safe CDU region of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the party risks being replaced as junior coalition partner to the Greens by the Social Democrats (SPD) and liberal Free Democrats.
In Rhineland-Palatinate, where such a ""traffic light"" coalition of party colours already governs, the CDU was leading in opinion polls as recently as late February but has now slipped behind the left-leaning SPD.
CDU leaders fear that if a traffic light alliance ousts them from government in Baden-Wuerttemberg, then such a tie-up could gain credibility at September's federal vote - and could leave the party in opposition at national level.
Its image has been tarnished by the face mask scandal, which has seen conservative lawmakers quit over allegations they received payments for arranging procurement deals.
Sunday's elections will also have ramifications within the conservative bloc of the CDU and its Bavaria sister party, which together run the federal government in coalition with the SPD.

While new CDU leader Armin Laschet is in pole position to succeed Merkel, defeat in Baden-Wuerttemberg could help his Bavarian rival Markus Soeder in his bid to become the conservative candidate for chancellor in September.

Both countries have largely brought the virus under control, helped by international border closures, lockdowns and strict social-distancing rules. 
Singapore is also discussing with Australia the mutual recognition of vaccination certificates and resumption of travel with priority for students and business travellers, Singapore's foreign ministry said in a statement.
""We are working with Singapore at the moment, potentially for a bubble in July,"" Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack, who is also transport minister, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 
He said Australia would open more bubbles as countries roll out their vaccination programmes. 
The Australian government did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for further details and comment. 
Singapore, an Asian transportation hub, is keen to revive its travel and tourism industry. After bringing its COVID-19 infections under control, it has been unilaterally easing quarantine requirements for travellers from Australia and a handful of other countries, such as New Zealand and China. 
A planned Singapore-Hong Kong air-travel bubble, which had been set to begin last November, stalled after Hong Kong saw a resurgence of COVID-19 infections.

The Southeast Asian island nation has largely banned leisure travel, but has put in place some business and official travel programmes. It is also discussing the mutual recognition of vaccine certificates with other nations. 
""I hope if that many countries can have substantial proportions of their populations vaccinated by later this year, we will be able to have the confidence and to have developed the systems to open up our international borders to travel safely again,"" Lee said in an interview with BBC that aired on Sunday. 
""Hopefully by the end of this year or next year, the doors can start to open, if not earlier,"" he said. 
The city-state has brought its COVID-19 situation under control with few new local cases and has been rolling out its vaccination programme, having approved shots from Pfizer-BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA). 
As of March 8, the country of 5.7 million people had administered just over 611,000 doses of vaccines - a much slower pace compared to larger nations. But it has said it plans to vaccinate everyone by year-end. 
Lee said few local cases meant the city-state could take the time to persuade its population to take the vaccine. Some are hesitant due to the low risk of infection and concern about possible side effects from rapidly developed vaccines.
Singapore has also received China's Sinovac Biotech vaccine ahead of approval. Lee said Singapore was evaluating the vaccine and will use it if it passes safety and effectiveness standards. 

The city-state's small, open economy recorded its worst recession in 2020 due to the pandemic, after being bruised the previous year by trade tensions between the United States and China.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - Hundreds of demonstrators gathered for a rally and march in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday to mark the one-year anniversary of the killing of Breonna Taylor, whose death helped fuel U.S. protests against police brutality.
Taylor, a Black 26-year-old emergency medical technician and aspiring nurse, was shot six times and killed by police in her Louisville home during a botched raid on March 13, 2020. 
A grand jury in September recommended no homicide charges against the three white officers in the case. One of the officers, Brett Hankison, was charged with three counts of wanton endangerment for firing into a neighbor’s apartment, and a juror said later those charges were the only ones brought to the grand jury by Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron.
Hankison and two other officers were fired by the police department.
The incident, along with the police killing in May of George Floyd in Minnesota, sparked demonstrations against racism and excessive use of force by law enforcement across the nation last summer.
During Saturday's rally in Louisville, speakers called for justice for Taylor and reforms to the criminal justice system.
""This is about our power to change this world for our children, for my daughter,"" said Sadiqa Reynolds, president of the Louisville Urban League. ""This is so we make sure that not another person dies at the hands of the police.”
Taylor's boyfriend Kenneth Walker also spoke briefly to the crowd. 
""They dropped the charges against me, but that is not where we finish,"" he said, referring to charges that were filed and later dismissed against him for shooting at the police officers during the incident. ""We got to keep going. Keep going."" 
Demonstrators then marched through downtown Louisville, chanting ""Black lives matter"" and ""no justice, no peace"" while waving signs showing Taylor's face.
Louisville Mayor Greg Fisher said his city has made significant reforms in policies and priorities, but that there was still ""a good deal of work ahead.""
Taylor's ""death resonates still in our city and around the world, underscoring the need to reform systems and act more urgently to advance racial justice and equity,"" he said on Twitter. 
Walker filed a federal lawsuit against the police department on Friday, one of his lawyers said. It alleges that the officers violated Walker's civil rights by conducting an unlawful search and using excessive force. A police department spokesman could not be reached for comment.
Louisville in September agreed to pay $12 million to settle a civil rights lawsuit filed by Taylor's family.
Protests were held in other cities across the United States on Saturday to mark Taylor's death, including in Atlanta and New York. President Joe Biden said on Twitter that he remains committed to signing a police reform bill into law.

""Breonna Taylor’s death was a tragedy, a blow to her family, her community, and America. As we continue to mourn her, we must press ahead to pass meaningful police reform in Congress,"" he wrote.

682,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2021 06:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: North Korea unresponsive to behind-the-scenes Biden administration outreach - U.S. official,"By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea has not responded to behind-the-scenes diplomatic outreach since mid-February by President Joe Biden's administration, including to Pyongyang's mission to the United Nations, a senior Biden administration official told Reuters on Saturday.
The disclosure of the so-far unsuccessful U.S. outreach, which has not been previously reported, raises questions about how Biden will address mounting tensions with Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
It also adds a new dimension to a visit America's top diplomat and defense secretary will make next week to South Korea and Japan, where concerns over North Korea's nuclear arsenal are expected to be high on the agenda. 
The senior Biden administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, offered few details on the diplomatic push. But the official said there had been efforts to reach out to the North Korean government ""through several channels starting in mid-February, including in New York.""
""To date, we have not received any response from Pyongyang,"" the official said.
North Korea's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Biden administration has so far been cautious in publicly describing its approach to North Korea, saying it is carrying out a comprehensive policy review following former President Donald Trump's unprecedented engagement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Trump's efforts failed to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. 
The Biden administration official said it appeared there had been no active dialogue between the United States and North Korea for more than a year, including at the end of Trump's administration, ""despite multiple attempts during that time by the United States to engage.""
The U.S. official declined to speculate about how the silence from Pyongyang would impact the Biden administration's North Korea policy review, which was expected to be completed in the coming weeks.
During his election campaign, Biden described Kim as a ""thug"" and said he would only meet him ""on the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity.""
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has held out the possibility of additional sanctions, in coordination with allies, to press North Korea to denuclearize.
Sanctions have so far failed to convince Kim to give up his nuclear weapons.
Blinken is slated to host the first face-to-face discussions between senior Biden administration and Chinese officials on March 18 in Alaska. The Trump administration accused China of failing to enforce sanctions against North Korea. A confidential U.N. report https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-sanctions-un-idUSKBN2A82G2 found that North Korea maintained and developed its nuclear and ballistic missile programs throughout 2020 in violation of international sanctions, helping fund them with some $300 million stolen through cyber hacks.

The report by independent sanctions monitors said Pyongyang ""produced fissile material, maintained nuclear facilities and upgraded its ballistic missile infrastructure"" while continuing to seek material and technology for those programs from abroad.

LONDON (Reuters) - Police in London clashed with mourners and protesters on Saturday after more than a thousand people gathered to mark the killing of a 33-year-old woman, hours after the police officer charged with her murder appeared in court.
Sarah Everard's disappearance as she walked home on the evening of March 3 had led to a wave of accounts from women about the dangers of walking streets alone at night, and dismay at the failure of police and wider society to tackle this.
Early on Saturday an impromptu memorial with flowers and candles sprang up around the bandstand on Clapham Common in southwest London, near where Everard was last seen alive.
Kate, Britain's Duchess of Cambridge, was among those who paid their respects. A palace official said Kate ""remembers what it was like to walk around London at night before she was married"".
By late on Saturday around a thousand people - mostly women - gathered at the site to pay their respects and protest at the lack of security they felt when out alone. Some chanted ""shame on you"" at police who were present.
Campaign groups had wanted to organise a formal vigil, but London's Metropolitan Police said people should not gather due to coronavirus restrictions. The head of the force, Cressida Dick, said any vigil ""would be unlawful and would be unsafe"".
As tensions mounted, Reuters witnesses saw police drag several women away from the gathering on Clapham Common.
Police were not immediately able to say how many people they had arrested. 
London Mayor Sadiq Khan - who is responsible for policing in the city - said officers' response ""was at times neither appropriate or proportionate"" and added that he was seeking an urgent explanation from Dick. 
Labour Party leader Keir Starmer called the scenes ""deeply disturbing"" and Conservative interior minister Priti Patel said she too wanted answers from police about ""upsetting"" images.
Earlier on Saturday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he and his partner Carrie Symonds would light a candle in memory of Everard.
""I will do everything I can to make sure the streets are safe and ensure women and girls do not face harassment or abuse,"" he said.
Appearing at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court on Saturday morning, 48-year-old police officer Wayne Couzens, wearing a grey tracksuit, spoke only to confirm his identity.
Couzens's lawyer did not enter a plea to the charges of kidnap and murder ahead of a fuller court hearing scheduled for Tuesday. Couzens remains in custody. 
Police discovered Everard's body on Wednesday in woodland about 50 miles (80 km) southeast of London. The court heard that her body was found in a builder's refuse bag, and was identified using dental records.
Couzens joined the Metropolitan Police in 2018 and guarded foreign embassies before his arrest.

England's police watchdog has launched an investigation into the Metropolitan Police's handling of the case.

DENVER (Reuters) - A powerful spring snow storm was expected over the next three days to blanket parts of the U.S. Rockies and central High Plains where forecasters warned of whiteout conditions, power outages and avalanches. 
The National Weather Service (NWS) issued blizzard warnings for parts of Wyoming and western Nebraska, where quickly accumulating snowfall of up to 2 feet (61 cm) and fierce winds reaching 65 miles (105 km) per hour could cause dangerous conditions from Saturday through Monday.
The weather service told travelers who must be on the road to carry emergency supplies and flashlights. It also warned that strong winds and the heavy snow could cause extensive damage to trees and power lines.
""We're preparing for a potentially historic winter storm to impact Southeast Wyoming,"" Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon said on Twitter. ""The best option is to stay off the roads this weekend."" 
To the south in Colorado, conditions were forecast to deteriorate throughout the day on Saturday. The I-25 urban corridor, where five million people live in cities such as Denver, was expected to get 2 feet of snow and 35 mph winds throughout the weekend. 
In Denver, rain turned to snow late Saturday morning as temperatures dropped to near freezing. A drier air pattern moving over the city in the afternoon temporarily slowed the rate of snowfall, the NWS said on Twitter.
""However, more intense snow will return by late afternoon/early evening and into Sunday,"" the weather service said. 
At Denver International Airport, 1,979 weekend flights in and out of the nation's fifth busiest airport were cancelled ahead of the storm, according to aviation tracking web site Flight Aware. 
Utility company  Xcel Energy  (NASDAQ:XEL) said this week that it was ""ramping up the number of crews"" to respond to any possible power outages caused by the heavy, wet snow. 

The NWS warned travelers and skiers in higher elevations that avalanches could be easily triggered as snow totals could rapidly accumulate, while Colorado Governor Jared Polis activated the state's National Guard to respond to search and rescue requests over the weekend.

The Spiegel weekly magazine first reported about an investigation into Reichelt's conduct earlier this week, saying several female employees had made accusations against the editor, including the abuse of power, coercion and bullying.
Axel Springer said Reichelt rejected the accusations, but had asked to be released temporarily from his position while the compliance investigation is underway. Springer said it has also called in external experts.
""An open-ended investigation is being conducted in all directions and the credibility and integrity of all those involved is being assessed,"" the publisher said in a statement.
""So far, there is no such evidence. Making prejudgements on the basis of rumours is unthinkable in Axel Springer's corporate culture.""
Springer said Alexandra Wuerzbach, editor-in-chief of the newspaper's Sunday edition, would take over editorial management for the time being.
Reichelt, previously head of the paper's digital edition, took over as editor-in-chief in 2018 after winning a power struggle with Tanit Koch, who said back then that her working relationship with Reichelt had broken down.
Springer agreed in 2019 to a takeover by U.S. private equity house KKR, hoping the move will give it greater freedom to build its digital portfolio and look for acquisitions away from the eye of skeptical equity markets.
Axel Springer AG was founded in 1946 by journalist Axel Springer and is now one of the largest publishing companies in Europe, also owning financial news website Business Insider.

Friede Springer, Axel Springer's widow, designated Chief Executive Mathias Doepfner as her successor last year as she gifted, sold and transferred the right to vote her stake in the business to him.

The Shahr e Kord vessel was hit by an explosive object which caused a small fire, but no one on board was hurt, Iran said on Friday. Two maritime security sources said initial indications suggested the ship was intentionally targeted by an unknown source. 
""Considering the geographical location and the way the ship was targeted, one of the strong possibilities is that this terrorist operation was carried out by the Zionist regime (Israel),"" an unnamed member of the Iranian team investigating the incident was quoted as saying by semi-official Nournews.
Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz declined to comment directly about the incident when addressing a webinar on Saturday hosted by his Blue and White party, but he said Iran regularly sent weapons to its proxies in the region.
""We foil arms supplies and other things relating to operational development and military capabilities by air, sea and land,"" Gantz said. ""And by this I am not saying whether we did or did not do this or that.""
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said reports confirmed an act of sabotage in violation of international law, state media said. ""Measures to identify the perpetrators of this sabotage action are on the agenda,"" he said.
The Iranian investigator said explosive projectiles could have been fired from an aerial vehicle, hitting containers on the ship's deck.
Iran's state-run shipping company IRISL said it would take legal action to identify the perpetrators of the attack, which it called terrorism and naval piracy.
The incident came two weeks after an Israeli-owned ship the MV HELIOS RAY was hit by an explosion in the Gulf of Oman. 

The cause was not immediately clear, although a U.S. defence official said the blast left holes in both sides of the vessel's hull. Israel accused Iran of being behind the explosion, a charge the Islamic Republic denied.

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - The Palestinian Authority and the Arab League on Saturday condemned the Czech Republic's opening of a diplomatic office in Jerusalem as a violation of international law. 
Prague opened a Jerusalem branch of its Israel embassy, which is located in Tel Aviv, on Thursday. 
The inauguration was attended by Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, two weeks after Israel sent 5,000  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) COVID-19 vaccine doses to the Czech Republic under a ""vaccine diplomacy"" programme that later came under legal scrutiny and was frozen.
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry called Prague's move ""a blatant attack on the Palestinian people and their rights, a flagrant violation of international law,"" and said it would harm peace prospects.
In Cairo, Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said in a statement: ""The legal status of Jerusalem will be affected by the decision of one country or another to open representative offices. East Jerusalem is an occupied land under the International law."" 
Underlining that the Jerusalem office was not an embassy, the Czech Foreign Ministry said it was meant to strengthen Prague's strategic partnership with Israel and improve services for Czech citizens there. 
""The establishment of the office has no impact on the will of the Czech Republic to further develop political and economic relations with the Palestinian Authority,"" it said.
Jerusalem's status is one of the thorniest issues in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel annexed the eastern part of the city in a move not recognised internationally, and regards all of Jerusalem as its capital. 
The Palestinians seek East Jerusalem, which Israel captured along with the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 Middle East War, as the capital of a future independent state.
Babis described Israel as a ""strategic partner"" and hailed the new office as a ""milestone in our co-operation.""
Only two countries have full embassies in Jerusalem: the United States - after former U.S. President Donald Trump broke with decades of U.S. policy to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel - and Guatemala. 
Although it formally supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Czech Republic was named in an International Criminal Court pre-trial decision last month as one of the countries supporting Israel's argument that the court should not investigate war crimes in the Palestinian territories. 

Babis said on Thursday that ""the Czech Republic doesn’t consider Palestine to be a state, therefore the court has no jurisdiction over it.”

ROME (Reuters) - Italy said on Saturday it aimed to vaccinate at least 80% of its population by the end of September, following criticism about the slow pace of the rollout of a coronavirus vaccination campaign in one of worst-hit nations in Europe.
Francesco Paolo Figliuolo, an army general and new special commissioner for coronavirus, released a national plan to administer 500,000 doses a day at full capacity, according to a cabinet office document.
Italy has registered 101,881 deaths since the outbreak emerged in the country in February 2020, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the seventh-highest in the world. It has reported 3.2 million cases of infection to date. 
Some 1.95 million Italians, equal to just 3.8% of the eligible population, have been administered two jabs of vaccine so far, sparking public criticism about the slow pace of the rollout and prompting the appointment of Figliuolo.
Italy expects to receive an increasing number of vaccines, with total deliveries raising from 15.7 million doses in the first quarter to 52.5 million between April and June to a peak of 84.9 million in the third quarter, the document said.
It plans to broaden the health operators administering shots by boosting an existing agreement to employ family doctors and by using dentists, junior doctors, doctors from the Italian Sports Medicine Federation and others.
In addition to healthcare facilities already in operation as vaccination points, Italy will use military barracks, production sites, large-scale retail outlets, gyms, schools and Catholic church's facilities.
Just under 51 million Italians are eligible for the vaccine and 60% of them could be vaccinated by the end of July, reaching the first threshold for herd immunity, the document showed.

Patheon Thermo Fischer, part of U.S.-listed Thermo Fischer Scientific, is ready to launch mass production of a COVID-19 vaccine in Italy, a government source said on Friday.

In a joint letter to the Commission and the European Council, leaders of six European countries, including Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Latvia, and later Croatia, called for discussions on vaccine distribution.
The Commission responded that doses have been distributed in proportion with the population of each country and taking into account epidemiological data, adding that was up to member state governments to decide how to share them.
A flexible policy agreed by EU governments meant countries facing a more acute phase of the epidemic could access more doses, if some governments opted for not taking up their pro rata allocation, the EU executive said in a statement.
""It would be up to the Member States to find an agreement if they wished to return to the pro rata basis,"" it said, adding it backed an allocation method based exclusively on a pro rata of population of each EU nation.
The Commission has been criticized for the bloc's slow vaccine roll-out, although EU governments play the main role in buying vaccines and in vaccination plans. 
On Friday, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said that vaccine doses were not being spread evenly among member states despite an agreement within the bloc to do so according to population. He blamed, without offering evidence, separate deals struck between the EU's vaccination steering board and drug companies.
The letter from Kurz and his counterparts, addressed to the Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel, called for ""a European solution"". 
""In recent days ... we have discovered that ... deliveries of vaccine doses by pharma companies to individual EU member states are not being implemented on an equal basis following the pro rata population key,"" said the letter, published in Austrian media.
""We therefore call on you, Charles, to hold a discussion on this important matter among leaders as soon as possible.""
Malta is on course to have three times more vaccine doses relative to its population by the end of June than Bulgaria, Kurz has said.
The letter did not mention the steering group, which is the body that negotiates vaccine deals with companies on behalf of EU states. The deputy head of the steering board is Austrian.
Opposition parties have accused Kurz of trying to deflect blame for the slow pace of vaccinations away from himself. The Social Democrats said he was seeking ""scapegoats for his failure"".
An EU official said Michel had received the letter and a leaders' summit was already planned for March 25 and 26.
""COVID coordination will again be addressed by the 27 members during that meeting,"" the official said, without specifying whether that included vaccine distribution.

Michel's office declined to comment.

Mahn Win Khaing Than, who is on the run along with most senior officials from the ruling National League for Democracy Party, addressed the public via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), saying, ""This is the darkest moment of the nation and the moment that the dawn is close"".
Witnesses and domestic media Myanmar Now and BBC Burmese said at least 12 protesters were killed on Saturday in one of the bloodiest days since the coup in which Myanmar's army seized power and detained most of the civilian leadership including Aung San Suu Kyi.
In its evening news broadcast, junta-run media MRTV labelled the protesters as ""criminals"" but did not elaborate.
Mahn Win Khaing Than was appointed last week as acting vice-president by representatives of Myanmar's ousted lawmakers, the Committee for Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), which is pushing for recognition as the rightful government.
It has announced its intention to create a federal democracy and leaders have been meeting representatives of Myanmar's largest ethnic armed organizations, which already control vast swathes of territory across the country. Some have pledged their support.
""In order to form a federal democracy, which all ethnic brothers, who have been suffering various kinds of oppressions from the dictatorship for decades, really desired, this revolution is the chance for us to put our efforts together,"" Mahn Win Khaing Than said.
His address was greeted with thousands of approving comments from many who followed it on Facebook. ""Keep it up Mr President! You are our hope. We are all with you,"" wrote one user, Ko Shan.
The junta, which could not be reached for comment on Saturday, has declared CRPH illegal and said anyone involved with it could be charged with treason, which carries the death penalty.
The CRPH has declared the junta a ""terrorist organisation"".
Mahn Win Khaing Than said the CRPH would ""attempt to legislate the required laws so that the people have the right to defend themselves"" and that public administration would be handled by an ""interim people's administration team"".

A civil disobedience movement that started with government employees such as doctors and teachers has expanded into a general strike that has paralysed many sectors of the economy and taken a large portion of the workings of government out of the military's hands.

KADUNA, Nigeria (Reuters) - A video of some of the students kidnapped from a college in northwest Nigeria emerged on Saturday, showing them cowering on a forest floor as armed captors hit them with sticks. 
Thirty nine students are missing after gunmen stormed the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization in Kaduna state overnight on Thursday, the fourth school abduction in northern Nigeria since December.
Video footage shared on social media showed roughly two dozen students begging for help in English and Hausa. One says the captors want a 500 million naira ($1.31 million) ransom.
""If anybody comes to rescue them without the money they are going to kill us,"" a male student says in the video as a man with a gun stands behind him. 
College Provost Bello Mohammed Usman and the mother of one kidnapped student on Saturday identified those shown in the video as some of the abducted students, including one pregnant woman. Usman declined to comment on the ransom request.
Abubakar Sadiq, executive secretary of the Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency, said he was unaware of the video and that he had no authority to comment on the ransom demand.
Earlier on Saturday, Kaduna state security commissioner Samuel Aruwan said nine more students were missing than previously thought - 23 females and 16 males.
""The Kaduna state government is maintaining close communication with the management of the college as efforts are sustained by security agencies towards the tracking of the missing students,"" Aruwan said.
The armed gang broke into the school, located on the outskirts of Kaduna city near a military academy, at around 11:30 p.m. (2230 GMT) on Thursday. Aruwan said a further 180 students and staff members who were staying at the school were rescued early on Friday.
Attacks by gangs of armed men, known as bandits, have intensified for several years, and military and police attempts to tackle the gangs have had little success. Many worry that state authorities worsen the situation by letting kidnappers go unpunished, paying them off or providing incentives. 
In a statement on Saturday, President Muhammadu Buhari urged that the missing students be found and returned safely to their families.
Gloria Paul said she recognized her 20-year-old daughter, Joy Kurmi Paul, in the video, wearing a pink headscarf. Outside the school on Saturday, the mother begged for help. 
""Please, government should help us get them released without hurting them,"" she said as tears rolled down her cheeks.

Five people were shot dead and several injured when police opened fire on a sit-in protest in Mandalay, Myanmar's second-biggest city, witnesses told Reuters. 
Another person was killed in the central town of Pyay and two died in police firing in the commercial capital Yangon, where three were also killed overnight, domestic media reported. 
""They are acting like they are in a war zone, with unarmed people,"" said Mandalay-based activist Myat Thu. He said the dead included a 13-year-old child.
Si Thu Tun, another protester, said he saw two people shot, including a Buddhist monk. ""One of them was hit in the pubic bone, another was shot to death terribly,"" he said.
In Pyay, a witness said security forces initially stopped an ambulance from reaching those who were injured, leading to one death.
A truck driver in Chauk, a town in the central Magwe Region, also died after being shot in the chest by police, a family friend said.
A spokesman for the junta did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment.
More than 70 people have been killed in Myanmar in widespread protests against the military's seizure of power, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group has said. 
The deaths came as the leaders of the United States, India, Australia and Japan vowed to work together to restore democracy in the Southeast Asian nation and the acting leader of the country's ousted civilian government addressed the public for the first time.
Mahn Win Khaing Than, who is in hiding along with most senior officials from the ruling National League for Democracy Party, addressed the public via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), saying, ""This is the darkest moment of the nation and the moment that the dawn is close"".

PROTESTS 
Saturday's protests erupted after posters spread on social media urging people to mark the death anniversary of Phone Maw, who was shot and killed by security forces in 1988 inside what was then known as the Rangoon Institute of Technology campus.
His shooting and that of another student who died a few weeks later sparked widespread protests against the military government known as the 8-8-88 campaign, because they peaked in August that year. An estimated 3,000 people were killed when the army crushed the uprising.
Aung San Suu Kyi emerged as a democracy icon during the movement and was kept under house arrest for nearly two decades.
She was released in 2010 as the military began democratic reforms. Her National League for Democracy won elections in 2015 and again in November last year.
On Feb. 1 this year, the generals overthrew her government and detained Suu Kyi and many of her cabinet colleagues, claiming fraud in the November elections.
The coup in Myanmar, where the military has close ties to China, is a major early test for U.S. President Joe Biden.
The U.S. President held a virtual meeting with the Indian, Japanese and Australian leaders on Friday, the first official summit of the group known as the Quad, as part of a push to demonstrate a renewed U.S. commitment to regional security.
""As longstanding supporters of Myanmar and its people, we emphasise the urgent need to restore democracy and the priority of strengthening democratic resilience,"" the four leaders said in a statement released by the White House.
SOUTH KOREA CUTS DEFENCE TIES
United Nations human rights investigator Thomas Andrews on Friday dismissed as ""absurd"" comments by a senior Myanmar official that authorities were exercising ""utmost restraint"". 
Addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, he called for a united approach to ""strip away the junta's sense of impunity"".
Former colonial power Britain on Friday warned its citizens in Myanmar to leave and South Korea said it would suspend defence exchanges and reconsider development aid to Myanmar.
The Kremlin said Russia, which has close ties to Myanmar's military, was concerned over the mounting violence and was ""analysing"" whether to suspend military-technical cooperation. 

The U.N. Security Council this week dropped language from a statement that condemned the army takeover as a coup, due to opposition by China, Russia, India and Vietnam.

694,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2021 10:20AM ET</span>",German COVID cases could revisit December peak in April,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German health experts warned on Saturday against any further easing of coronavirus lockdown measures as the number of cases jumped again, raising the possibility that infections could again reach peaks seen around Christmas by mid-April.
The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases predicted that the number of daily reported cases could exceed 30,000 in the 14th week of the year starting April 12.
""An extrapolation of the trends shows that case numbers can be expected above the Christmas level from week 14 onwards,"" the RKI said in its current situation report.
On Saturday, the number of COVID-19 cases rose by 12,674 and the death toll was up 239, with the number of cases per 100,000 over seven days jumping to 76.1 from 72.4.
Germany's death toll from the virus stands at 73,301, with a reported 2,558,455 infections.
Frustration about the ongoing lockdown and the slow pace of vaccinations has been denting support for Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, also under fire over a face mask procurement scandal involving lawmakers from the party.
A small group of protesters braved rain in Berlin on Saturday to demonstrate against the lockdown.
Merkel's Christian Democrats have seen support slip in two states where regional elections on Sunday will be a crucial gauge of popular feeling before a federal election in September. 
Merkel and state leaders agreed a phased easing of curbs earlier this month along with an ""emergency brake"" to let authorities reimpose restrictions if case numbers rise above 100 per 100,000 on three consecutive days.
The RKI report said the rapid spread in Germany of a more infectious virus variant first detected in Britain could mean that the number of cases per 100,000 reaches levels of between 200 and 500 by mid-April.
Leaders are due to meet again on March 22 to discuss whether any further relaxation of the rules is possible.

""We can only have more relaxation if there are stable or falling case numbers,"" Karl Lauterbach, health expert for the Social Democrats, told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper, adding this was unlikely anytime soon.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian police detained around 200 people, including several prominent opposition figures, at a meeting of independent and opposition politicians in Moscow on Saturday, the interior ministry said.
The detentions come amid a crackdown on anti-Kremlin sentiment, following the arrest and imprisonment of opposition politician Alexei Navalny who returned to Russia in January after recovering from a nerve agent poisoning in Siberia. 
The Moscow forum, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, was a gathering of municipal deputies from all over the country, Andrei Pivovarov, the event's organiser and executive director of Open Russia, a British-based group founded by exiled former oil tycoon and Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky, told radio station Echo Moskvy.
As the forum got underway, police entered the building and began detaining attendees and taking them to police vans waiting outside, video footage from TV Rain and Russian news agencies showed. 
The Moscow branch of Russia's interior ministry said around 200 people had been detained and that an investigation was underway. 
Police said those detained were not following the appropriate anti-coronavirus health measures even though footage showed most of them wearing masks. They said some of those attending the forum had links to an ""undesirable organisation"".
""A significant portion of participants lacked personal protective equipment,"" the police said. ""Members of an organisation whose activities are considered undesirable on Russian territory were among the participants.""
OVD-Info, which monitors the detention of political protesters and activists, put the number of detainees at more than 170. 
""The finale of the short forum was very symbolic: deputies in police vans and masked police twisting people's arms,"" one detainee, opposition politician Ilya Yashin, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
""But no one promised us freedom on a silver platter. Russia will still be free."" 
Vladimir Kara-Murza, vice-president of the Free Russia Foundation, a Washington-based non-profit organisation, shared a picture from the inside of a police van after he was detained.
TV Rain said Yevgeny Roizman, the former mayor of Yekaterinburg, and Moscow city councillor Yulia Galyamina were also detained.

Open Russia is one of more than 30 groups that Moscow has labelled as undesirable and banned under a law adopted in 2015.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday he wanted to see Eritrean forces and those from the Amhara region replaced in Tigray by security forces that will respect human rights and not ""commit acts of ethnic cleansing"".
""(The accusation) is a completely unfounded and spurious verdict against the Ethiopian government,"" the ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement on Saturday.
""Nothing during or after the end of the main law enforcement operation in Tigray can be identified or defined by any standards as a targeted, intentional ethnic cleansing against anyone in the region,"" it said. ""The Ethiopian government vehemently opposes such accusations."" 
Ethiopia's federal army ousted the former regional ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), from the capital Mekelle in November, after what it said was a surprise assault on its forces in the region bordering Eritrea. 
The government has said that most fighting has ceased but has acknowledged there are still isolated incidents of shooting.
Ethiopia and Eritrea have denied the involvement of Eritrean troops in the fighting alongside Ethiopian forces, although dozens of witnesses, diplomats and an Ethiopian general have reported their presence.
Thousands of people have died following the fighting, hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes and there are shortages of food, water and medicine in Tigray, a region of more than 5 million people.
Ethiopia's foreign ministry said it was ready to work with international human rights experts to conduct investigations on allegations of abuses. 

""The Ethiopian government has demonstrated its readiness to engage positively and constructively with all the relevant regional and international stakeholders in responding to the serious allegations of human rights abuses and crimes,"" it said.

Featuring lyrics such as ""I will teach you to toe the line"", the entry had sparked a backlash from opposition figures and fuelled calls by a European Parliament lawmaker for Belarus to be suspended from the popular competition.
Eurovision's organisers, the European Broadcasting Union, on Thursday threatened Belarus with disqualification if it did not submit a modified version of the entry or submit a new song.
To critics, allowing the original entry to be performed would have added legitimacy to a violent crackdown launched by Lukashenko against mass unrest that swept the country following an August election which demonstrators say was rigged to extend his 27-year rule.
To Lukashenko, it was another example of Belarus being besieged by outside forces. The veteran president has clung to power with support from traditional ally Russia and accused the West of fuelling the protests to overthrow him.
""They are starting to press us on all fronts. Even at Eurovision, I see,"" Lukashenko said, in his first public comments about the row. 
""We'll make another song,"" he said, adding: ""You see that this is all politicized.""
He also commented for the first time on a film released this week by a Poland-based opposition news service that accused Lukashenko of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a luxurious lifestyle.

""I will never allow myself to steal something from people,"" he said.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Former Bolivian President Jeanine Anez has been arrested for alleged involvement in a ""coup"" against long-time leftist leader Evo Morales in 2019, the socialist government said on Saturday. 
Morales resigned and fled Bolivia in 2019 amid fierce protests against his government and allegations of electoral fraud. Anez, a former senator, took over as interim president by default, but 11 months later Morales' MAS socialist party returned to power in elections last October. 
Government Minister Eduardo del Castillo said the Public Prosecutor's Office issued an arrest warrant for Anez ""due to the case of a coup in our country"", a claim Morales, president for nearly 14 years, has long made against his conservative political opponent.
On Friday evening, Anez had shared a link to the arrest warrant on social media, which included her name and those of many of her former Cabinet and said it contained allegations of terrorism and sedition against them.
""The political persecution has begun,"" Anez said in her post. ""The MAS has decided to return to the styles of the dictatorship.
Morales angered many when he ran for an unprecedented fourth term in 2019, defying term limits. The election, which he won but was later annulled, was dogged by allegations of fraud, including from the Organization of American States (OAS).
His supporters claimed he was ousted in a coup.
""It was not a coup, it was constitutional succession due to electoral fraud,"" Anez wrote on Twitter on Friday.
Anez's 11-month caretaker administration had taken Bolivia in a sharply different direction to Morales and had itself detained some members of Morales' previous government.
Morales' former economy minister Luis Arce won in a landslide for MAS to become president, enabling Morales to return from exile. 
Bolivian prosecutors are also seeking to arrest two former commanders accused by the current government of involvement in the purported coup against Morales. The military had urged Morales to resign during the protests in 2019.

A prosecutor issued arrest warrants on Thursday for former police chief Yuri Calderón and former Armed Forces commander Williams (NYSE:WMB) Kaliman over allegations of terrorism, sedition and conspiracy.

The victim was killed on Friday in clashes with coast guards pursuing smugglers in the Gulf waters of Sirik, the semi-official Fars agency said.
It quoted Hossein Dehaki, head of the southern Hormozgan province coast guard, as saying that a crowd later attacked a coast guard post in the Kouhestak district, injuring several guards.
The incident took place about two weeks after the shooting death of at least two people carrying fuel across the Iranian border into Pakistan, triggering protests that spread from the border city of Saravan to other areas in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan.
According to the United Nations, up to 23 people may have been killed during the protests by Revolutionary Guards and security forces.
Iran has some of the lowest fuel prices in the world and has been fighting smuggling to neighbouring countries.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka will ban the wearing of the burqa and shut more than a thousand Islamic schools, a government minister said on Saturday, the latest actions affecting the country's minority Muslim population. 
Minister for public security Sarath Weerasekera told a news conference he had signed a paper on Friday for cabinet approval to ban the full face covering worn by some Muslim women on ""national security"" grounds. 
""In our early days Muslim women and girls never wore the burqa,"" he said. ""It is a sign of religious extremism that came about recently. We are definitely going to ban it.""
The wearing of the burqa in the majority-Buddhist nation was temporarily banned in 2019 after the bombing of churches and hotels by Islamic militants that killed more than 250. 
Later that year, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, best known for crushing a decades-long insurgency in the north of the country as defence secretary, was elected president after promising a crackdown on extremism. 
Rajapaksa is accused of widespread rights abuses during the war, charges he denies. 
Weerasekera said the government plans to ban more than a thousand madrassa Islamic schools that he said were flouting national education policy. 
""Nobody can open a school and teach whatever you want to the children,"" he said.
The government's moves on burqas and schools follow an order last year mandating the cremation of COVID-19 victims - against the wishes of Muslims, who bury their dead.

This ban was lifted earlier this year after criticism from the United States and international rights groups.

LONDON (Reuters) - Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney said on Saturday that Britain was demonstrating ""perverse nationalism"" by seeking to reach a trade deal with the United States before the European Union and questioned whether it was a trustworthy partner.
""This idea that Britain can get there first is narrow minded thinking, frankly. It's a perverse nationalism when actually Britain and the EU should work together as partners,"" he said in an interview with The Times newspaper.
Coveney advocated Britain working with the EU and Canada to reach a joint trade deal with the United States, although the EU does not currently have plans for a major U.S. trade deal.
He also questioned Britain's trustworthiness following its plans to unilaterally delay imposing checks required by the Brexit deal on some food products travelling from England, Scotland or Wales to Northern Ireland.
""It has reinforced an awful lot of the doubts in Brussels about whether or not this really is a British government we can rely on to be a trusted partner when it comes to implementing what has already been agreed,"" he said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson views the ability to strike trade deals as one of the main benefits of Brexit and sees a deal with the United States as a big potential prize.
Relations between London and Dublin have deteriorated since Britain voted in 2016 to leave the European Union.
Trade arrangements in the British province of Northern Ireland have proved a particular sticking point. 
In a separate interview with Northern Ireland's News Letter newspaper, Brandon Lewis, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, indicated that 'grace periods' for the food checks should be extended indefinitely until a new long-term agreement was reached.

""My position and the government's position in terms of the grace period we've got for chilled meats at the moment is not that at the end of that grace period there is a cliff edge; it's that we use the grace period to get a permanent solution to ensure that those products can continue to flow,"" Lewis said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's High Court on Saturday released on bail three more activists but remanded two in custody in a widely monitored case involving the most sweeping use yet of the city's national security law.
The High Court was ruling on an appeal by prosecutors against a lower court's decision to grant bail to the five activists. 
Tat Cheng, Michael Pang and Ricky Or were granted bail, while Jeremy Tam and Kwok Ka-ki were denied bail by High Court judge Esther Toh.
Some family members of those denied bail cried after hearing the verdict, including Tam's wife. But Kwok's wife remained defiant, holding up a sign outside the court that read:
""Dear Hongkongers. You'll never walk alone! Add oil!""
An appeal against granting bail to four others will be heard on Monday.
The charges on conspiracy to commit subversion against 47 opposition figures are being closely watched by foreign diplomats and rights groups. 
They have raised concerns over the vanishing space for dissent in the former British colony, which has taken a swift authoritarian turn since the imposition of the law in June 2020.
Since the 47 were charged around two weeks ago, the court has heard a series of requests for bail. Although most were rejected, the court approved some applications, prompting immediate appeals from prosecutors.
Eight have been granted bail so far, including Saturday's three, as prosecutors' appeals were either rejected or withdrawn.
The bail conditions for the three on Saturday included not threatening national security, participating in any elections except to vote, or contacting foreign officials, as well as surrendering all travel documents, observing a curfew and reporting to police regularly. 
The 47 are accused of organising and participating in an unofficial, non-binding primary poll in July 2020 that authorities said was part of a ""vicious plot"" to ""overthrow"" the government.
The vote was aimed at selecting the strongest opposition candidates for a legislative council election that the government later postponed, citing the coronavirus.

""We, the elephant people, are hoping that the government will open up the country (soon) to welcome foreign tourists in order for them to bring in income so that we can pay for the elephant food and compensation for their handlers,"" said Ittipan Kharwlamai, General Manager of the Royal Elephant Kraal and Village, an elephant camp, located north of Bangkok.
""We hope that tourists will help us and all 3,800 (domesticated) elephants to survive,"" he said.
The tourism-reliant country has yet to lift a travel ban imposed last April to curb the outbreak, keeping most foreign travellers and investors away.
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy suffered its deepest slump in over two decades last year, when the number of foreign visitors plunged 83% from nearly 40 million in 2019.

Animal rights groups have long been calling for the elephant camps in Thailand to end animal shows and rides, branding the shows a form of animal abuse.

707,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2021 01:56AM ET</span>",Mexico's ruling political party ratifies candidate accused of rape,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's MORENA party ratified late on Friday a gubernatorial candidate accused of rape, in a case that has fueled fiery protests and been a source of friction within the ruling party.
MORENA approved Felix Salgado Macedonio to run as governor for the state of Guerrero, following weeks of support from Lopez Obrador, who had described the calls for Salgado to step down amid the allegations as politically motivated.
Salgado has denied the allegations, according to Mexican media. He has not responded to Reuters requests for comment.
""The inaction of judicial authorities in cases of violence against women not only violates their rights, but also denies us, as a society, the right to truth and justice,"" MORENA said in a statement.
""However, our political institute cannot place itself above the organs of justice, nor violate essential rights, such as the presumption of innocence,"" it added.
Guerrero prosecutors are investigating one accusation of rape against Salgado, after earlier this year dropping a probe into another accusation that they say was filed too long after the alleged crime. 
Salgado's candidacy and Lopez Obrador's support for him have caused friction within MORENA and helped whip up protests demanding justice for victims of violence and an end to Mexico's crisis of femicide.
At marches to mark International Women's Day on Monday, activists projected feminist slogans in bright lights across the facade of the presidential palace, which had been barricaded, including a message saying ""a rapist will not be governor,"" referring to Salgado.
""The ratification of Salgado Macedonio is an insult to Mexico, especially to Mexican women. Once again it has become clear that Lopez Obrador and MORENA do not care about women, their voice, nor their safety,"" Adriana Aguilar, the head of women's issues for the opposition National Action Party said on Twitter.

According to public policy think tank Mexico Evalua, which analyzed government data, five million women were victims of sexual violence in the second half of 2020 alone in Mexico, including harassment, sexual abuse, attempted rape or rape, the vast majority of which did not get reported.

The G7 released a statement that was tweeted by British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, saying the recent decision to change Hong Kong's electoral system indicated that authorities in China were determined to eliminate dissenting voices and opinions in Hong Kong. 
""We also call on China and the Hong Kong authorities to restore confidence in Hong Kong's political institutions and end the unwarranted oppression of those who promote democratic values and the defence of rights and freedoms,"" it said. 
China's parliament approved on Thursday a draft decision to change Hong Kong's electoral system, further reducing democratic representation in the city's institutions and introducing a mechanism to vet politicians' loyalty to Beijing.
The measures are part of Beijing's efforts to consolidate its increasingly authoritarian grip over the Asian financial hub following the imposition of a national security law in June 2020, which critics see as a tool to crush dissent.
The European Commission and the High Representative noted in an annual report on Friday that there has been an ""alarming political deterioration in Hong Kong"", citing the imposition of the national security law, the arrest of dozens of pro-democracy activists in January, and Beijing's move this week to overhaul the city's politics.
""China is consciously dismantling the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle in violation of its international commitments and the Hong Kong Basic Law,"" EU High Representative/Vice-President Josep Borrell said.
Separately, Australia and New Zealand said they are deeply concerned, urging Hong Kong and China to allow ""genuine avenues"" for the city's people to participate in their governance, and to protect the role of the Legislative Council.
In Hong Kong, the government said in a statement late on Friday it strongly opposed the EU's remarks and that the report's questioning of China's willingness to uphold the ""one country, two systems"" principle was a ""groundless accusation"".

The Hong Kong government said stability had been restored to society since the implementation of the national security law.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A second senior official from Korea Land and Housing Corp (LH) was found dead in Paju, north of South Korean capital Seoul, in an apparent suicide amid a growing insider property speculation scandal, an officer from the Paju Police Station said. 
Yonhap news agency had reported the death earlier on Saturday, and had said the LH official did not appear to be a subject of a probe into the accusations of insider speculation by dozens of employees of the state housing corporation. 
This is the second death of an LH official since the South Korean government this week declared war on property crime. 
The other official was found dead on Friday, also of an apparent suicide. He had left a letter saying he was sorry for doing ""undesirable things"" when he headed LH's office in the province of North Jeolla, Yonhap had reported.
According to an initial investigation into the scandal, at least 20 LH employees are suspected of trying to use classified knowledge to buy undeveloped land before new development projects were slated to begin in the areas, South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Thursday.
Criticising the sluggish progress of the current probe, the main opposition People Party has demanded an investigation led by prosecutors to ensure a speedy and thorough process. 
The scandal has sparked outrage in South Korea as property prices in and around Seoul have soared, making affordable housing hard to find.
South Korea's Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, Byeon Chang-heum, has offered to resign over the scandal. Though he has not been implicated personally, Byeon was head of LH from April 2019 until December 2020.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba accused Washington of stoking illegal migration by not processing visas in Havana and making it relatively easy for Cubans to claim asylum, in the wake of a spate of ill-fated clandestine attempts to reach U.S. shores by boat.
The fate of a group of Cubans risking their lives to reach the United States illegally by boat has gripped people on both sides of the Florida Straits after a vessel capsized near the Bahamas a week ago, leaving some people floating in the water for more than 14 hours. 
While a Royal Bahamas Defence Force ship has rescued 12 people and recovered one body, several others have not yet been found, including women and two children, the Cuban foreign ministry said in a statement late on Thursday.
Thousands of Cubans used to attempt to emigrate to the United States by boat per year until former U.S. President Barack Obama in 2017 ended a measure granting automatic residence to Cubans who reached U.S. soil, though he left in place some other exceptions to usual migration rules. 
Since then, the numbers have dropped but still hover around several hundred per year. 
The U.S. Coast Guard has intercepted 87 people of Cuban origin in the Caribbean in the first six months of the 2021 fiscal year which began on Oct. 1, a spokesman told Reuters. That is an increase on the 49 registered in the full 2020 fiscal year, although this was impacted by the pandemic, and compares with 314 in 2019, the spokesman said. 
""Among the factors that constitute incentives for irregular migration are the suspension of the processing and granting of immigrant and non-immigrant visas at the United States Consulate in Havana,"" the Cuban foreign ministry said in its statement.
A U.S. State Department official said in response to the statement that it had designated the U.S. embassy in Guyana as the primary site to process immigrant visas for residents of Cuba. The United States was committed to supporting ""safe, orderly, and humane migration from Cuba,"" the official said.
The administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump drew the U.S. embassy in Havana down to skeletal staffing after a series of unexplained health incidents among its diplomats, moving consular services for Cubans to third countries.
Trump's successor, President Joe Biden, vowed during his campaign to reverse some Trump policy shifts that ""have inflicted harm on the Cuban people."" But hopes he might move quickly restore consular services were dampened when the White House said this week a broad Cuba policy shift is not among Biden's top priorities.
Nonetheless, the perception Biden will be more tolerant than Trump towards undocumented migrants, as well as Cuba's deepening economic crisis, are likely also boosting illegal migration this year, said Jorge Duany, director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University.
Under a 1966 act, it is also easier for Cubans than migrants from many other places to gain ""political asylum"" and a green card that grants permanent residency. 
Following the capsizing of the boat off the Bahamas, distraught relatives of the missing pled on Miami television channels for authorities to shed light on the situation, in images widely shared on social media in Cuba. 
""I am desperate because these children who were like my children have disappeared,"" said Niurka Caballero, whose two- and four-year-old great niece and nephew were on the boat with their mother.

""Cuba at least found the boat and has said it will continue the search,"" Caballero told Reuters by telephone from the northern coastal town of Caibarien. ""We still have some hope.""

711,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 08:06PM ET</span>",New York's two senators join mounting calls for Governor Cuomo to resign,"By Gabriella Borter and Joseph Ax
(Reuters) - New York's two U.S. senators joined other leading Democrats in urging New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign on Friday after a seventh woman came forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct.
Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, and Kirsten Gillibrand, a leading voice of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and abuse, joined others including U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in calling on the three-term Democratic governor to resign.
Cuomo, 63, the divorced father of three daughters in their 20s, again repeated his denial of the allegations on Friday and said it was ""reckless and dangerous"" for politicians to ask him to resign before they have all the facts.
""Women have a right to come forward and be heard, and I encourage that fully. But I also want to be clear: there is still a question of the truth. I did not do what has been alleged, period,"" Cuomo said on a call with reporters. 
""Wait for the facts. An opinion without facts is irresponsible,"" he said. 
Asked on Friday if he ever had consensual romantic relationships with any of the women, Cuomo responded by saying only that he never intended to make anyone feel uncomfortable, and was sorry if he did.
Hours after the governor's call with reporters, Schumer and Gillibrand became the highest-profile national politicians to urge him to resign. 
""Due to the multiple, credible sexual harassment and misconduct allegations, it is clear that Governor Cuomo has lost the confidence of his governing partners and the people of New York,"" the two senators said in a joint statement.
A growing list of women including former aides have accused the governor of sexual misconduct, ranging from unwelcome flirtatious behavior at work to groping.
Reporter Jessica Bakeman became the latest on Friday, writing a first-person account for New York magazine. She said Cuomo had often put his hands on her, including one time when taking a picture with her at a 2014 holiday party when she said he remarked, ""I'm sorry. Am I making you uncomfortable? I thought we were going steady.""
Bakeman said she did not want to smile for the camera with Cuomo's hands on her, but decided it was easier to take a quick picture than challenge a powerful politician.
""I never thought the governor wanted to have sex with me. It wasn't about sex. It was about power,"" she wrote. ""He wanted me to know that he could take my dignity away at any moment with an inappropriate comment or a hand on my waist.""
The new calls for Cuomo to resign came a day after more than 55 Democratic New York state lawmakers urged him to step down, and the state legislature said it would open an impeachment investigation into the allegations. 
The legislative inquiry will run parallel to an investigation led by the office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James.
The two senators joined at least 16 of the 27 members of New York's U.S. congressional delegation in urging Cuomo to quit, calling into question the political future of the high profile Democratic figure, who gained national prominence for his leadership during the peak of his state's COVID-19 crisis. 
While 15 U.S. House members from New York issued their statements on Friday, a House aide told Reuters there was no formal, coordinated effort within the delegation to pressure Cuomo.
On Tuesday, an unnamed aide told the Times Union that Cuomo had groped her after calling her to the executive mansion under the pretext of business last year, long after the #MeToo movement took down a host of politicians, media figures and business leaders for sexual harassment or assault.
""The fact that this latest report was so recent is alarming, and it raises concerns about the present safety and well-being of the administration's staff,"" Ocasio-Cortez said in a joint statement on Friday with U.S. Representative Jamaal Bowman.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday that President Joe Biden ""certainly supports"" the state attorney general's investigation into the allegations. She added that the president and his COVID-19 response team would continue working with Cuomo on vaccination roll-out in New York.

(Reuters) - The city of Minneapolis on Friday agreed to pay $27 million to settle a lawsuit by the family of George Floyd over his death in police custody, a case that stirred national protests over racial injustice and police brutality. 
Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died in May as Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd's dying pleas for help were captured on widely viewed bystander video, sparking one of the largest protest movements ever seen in the United States.
Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Floyd family, said the agreement was the largest pre-trial settlement of a wrongful death lawsuit in U.S. history. 
The size signifies that a Black person's death at the hands of police ""will no longer be written off as trivial, unimportant or unworthy of consequences,"" Crump said at a news conference where he was joined by Floyd's relatives, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and other officials.
Floyd's family was ""pleased that this part of our tragic journey to justice for my brother George is resolved,"" his sister Bridgett Floyd said in a statement. 
""While our hearts are broken, we are comforted in knowing that even in death, George Floyd showed the world how to live,"" her statement said.
The trial of Chauvin, who was fired by the police force, began earlier this week in Hennepin County's district court on charges of murder and manslaughter. Chauvin has pleaded not guilty and said he properly followed his police training.
Judge Peter Cahill has set aside about three weeks for jury selection in the high-profile case. Five men and two women had been seated as jurors as of Friday afternoon.
Last year, Floyd's relatives sued the city, Chauvin and three other police officers involved in federal court, saying police used excessive force against Floyd in violation of his constitutional rights. 
Although Frey promised on Friday that the city would be ""unrelenting"" in reforming its police department, it was not clear if the city was admitting wrongdoing as part of the settlement, and city officials did not immediately respond to queries.
""Every American remembers where they were when they first saw it,"" Frey said of the video showing Floyd's death. ""Today's settlement reflects our shared commitment to advancing racial justice."" 
The settlement includes a $500,000 contribution from Floyd's family to the community at the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd died, which has been barricaded against police access by residents and is filled with flowers and other tributes to Floyd.
Chauvin was helping arrest Floyd on the evening of May 25 on suspicion of his using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes at the Cup Foods grocery store at the intersection.

The other three officers are due to go on trial later this year on charges of aiding and abetting Chauvin in Floyd's death, which was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner. The Minneapolis Police Department fired all four officers the day after the deadly arrest.

Court documents showed Jessica Johanna Oseguera Gonzalez made property transactions for six businesses providing material support to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) run by her father Nemesio ""El Mencho"" Oseguera, the department said in a press release.
In so doing, the 34-year-old dual U.S.-Mexican citizen violated criminal penalties of the foreign narcotics kingpin designation act, known as the Kingpin Act, the department said.
Her guilty plea came about thanks to the United States' commitment to disrupt and dismantle all aspects of the CJNG, the press release cited special agent in charge Bill Bodner of the Drug Enforcement Administration's Los Angeles field division as saying.
U.S. officials have described Oseguera, who was arrested in February 2020, as the gang's main money launderer.
She is scheduled to be sentenced on June 11 and faces a maximum penalty of up to 30 years in prison.
Oseguera is also a niece of Abigael Gonzalez Valencia, boss of Los Cuinis, an outfit allied to the CJNG. He was arrested in 2015 and has been fighting extradition to the United States.
Her father, a former policeman, remains at large. ""El Mencho"" is one of the most wanted men in Mexico and has a $10-million U.S. bounty on his head.

Constable Wayne Couzens, 48, who guarded diplomatic buildings, will appear in court on Saturday. Everard disappeared while walking home from a friend's house in south London on March 3.
The Metropolitan police had confirmed that a body found in a wood outside London was that of the missing woman.
Her case has led to an outpouring of personal accounts by women of their own experiences and fears of walking streets alone at night, and a campaign for action to address this.
""The investigation continues of course,"" Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave told reporters. ""I would like to use this opportunity to encourage anyone that thinks they might have useful information to give, to get in contact with us."" 
He had said earlier in the day that he understood the hurt and anger sparked by the case. ""Those are sentiments that I share personally,"" Ephgrave said. ""I also recognise the wider concerns that are being raised quite rightly about the safety of women in public spaces in London and also elsewhere in the country.""
Home Secretary (interior minister) Priti Patel said she would do all she could to protect women and girls following the outcry that has followed Everard's disappearance.
""Every woman & girl should be free to walk our streets without the slightest fear of harassment, abuse or violence,"" she said on Twitter.
However, police have been criticised by organisers of a planned ""Reclaim These Streets"" vigil on Saturday near to where Everard was last seen, after officers said it could not take place due to COVID-19 restrictions.

A woman in her 30s, who media said was the partner of Couzens, was released on police bail after having been detained on suspicion of assisting an offender.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A fund providing restitution to victims of Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuses will resume offering payouts following a five-week halt, after receiving assurances from the late financier's estate there will be enough cash to fund payouts.
Jordana Feldman, the fund's administrator, announced the immediate resumption of full operations at the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program on Friday, following the receipt of $10 million from the proceeds of recent sales of Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida.
The program has received more than 175 claims since being created last June, and paid out more than $67 million. Eligible victims have until March 25 to file claims.
Feldman had suspended payout offers on Feb. 4, citing uncertainty about the liquidity of assets from the estate to fund payouts.
The resumption came after Epstein's townhouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side was sold this week for $51 million, according to Daniel Weiner, a lawyer for the estate's executors.
It also followed the rejection by a judge in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned two islands, of a bid by the territory's attorney general Denise George to freeze the estate's assets, saying George lacked legal standing.
George had complained that the estate's assets were falling too fast, and accused the two executors of being the ""indispensable captains"" of Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. The executors rejected her misconduct allegations. 
Once worth $634 million, Epstein's estate was recently worth $240.8 million after paying taxes and other expenses, and contributing money to the victims' fund.

Epstein signed his will on Aug. 8, 2019, two days before killing himself in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

The decision means about 1,600 Burmese already in the United States, including diplomats who have broken with Myanmar's junta, will be eligible for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, two officials told Reuters.
The program grants immigrants who cannot return to their countries safely, for reasons such as natural disasters or armed conflict, the ability to stay and work in the United States legally for a defined period that can be renewed.
The officials said the situation in Myanmar after the military seized power prevents Burmese from returning, citing the violent crackdown by security forces, arbitrary detentions and worsening humanitarian conditions. 
Thomas Andrews, the United Nations human rights investigator https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2L96D9 on Myanmar said on Thursday the junta had killed at least 70 people and detained more than 2,000. 
Some Myanmar diplomats posted to the United States have spoken out publicly against the military, including Permanent Representative to the United Nations Kyaw Moe Tun.
Diplomats who ""bravely joined the civil disobedience movement in solidarity with their countrymen back home"" would be able to stay in the United States under the program, one official said. 
""We want them to know they can do that safely,"" the official said.
The U.S. officials said unless the military reversed course, more punitive action was likely. ""If they do not restore democracy and cease violence against civilians, then we will continue taking actions ... against military leaders and their financial networks,"" one official said.
President Joe Biden last month rolled out sanctions on Myanmar on those responsible for the ouster of the southeast Asian nation's civilian-led government, including the defense minister and three companies in the jade and gems sector.
Earlier this week, Washington imposed sanctions on two children of military leader Min Aung Hlaing, who had already been designated, and six companies they control.
But it has so far held back from sanctions against military conglomerates Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL), among those used by the military to control vast swathes of the economy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The State Department on Friday said Washington has decided not to lift the pause in assistance to Ethiopia for most programs in the security sector, days after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described acts in Tigray as ethnic cleansing.
State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Friday that while the United States has decided to resume certain types of assistance, including that related to global health and food security, assistance for other programs and most programs in the security sector would remain paused.
""Given the current environment in Ethiopia, we have decided not to lift the assistance pause for other programs, including most programs in the security sector,"" Price said at a news briefing.
Blinken has pressed Ethiopia to end hostilities in Tigray and on Wednesday, testifying before Congress, he said he wanted to see forces in Tigray from Eritrea and Amhara be replaced by security forces ""that will not abuse the human rights of the people of Tigray or commit acts of ethnic cleansing, which we've seen in western Tigray.""
Thousands of people have died, hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes, and there are shortages of food, water and medicine in the region of more than 5 million people.
The State Department last month said Washington will de-link its pause on some aid to Ethiopia from its policy on the giant Blue Nile hydropower dam that sparked a long-running dispute between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan.
But it cautioned that resumption of assistance would be assessed on a number of factors, including ""whether each paused program remains appropriate and timely in light of developments in Ethiopia that occurred subsequent to the pause being put in place,"" according to a State Department spokesperson.
Ethiopia’s military ousted the former local ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), from the regional capital Mekelle in November, after what it described as a surprise assault on its forces in Tigray.
The government has said that most fighting has stopped in Tigray but has acknowledged isolated incidents of shooting.
Both sides deny their forces have committed atrocities, and blame other forces for the killing of civilians.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A growing number of Americans want to get the coronavirus vaccine, and a majority also support workplace, lifestyle and travel restrictions for those not inoculated against COVID-19, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.
The national opinion poll of 1,005 people, conducted on Monday and Tuesday, suggested the pace of vaccinations may pick up as more vaccines become available and more people want them.
Altogether, 54% of respondents said they were ""very interested"" in getting vaccinated. That was up from a January survey, when 41% expressed the same level of interest, and 38% in a May 2020 poll before a coronavirus vaccine was developed.
Interest in the vaccine increased over the past year among whites and racial minorities, with about six in 10 whites and five in 10 members of minority groups now expressing a high level of interest. 
Twenty-seven percent of Americans said they were not interested in getting vaccinated, which was relatively unchanged from a similar poll that ran in May.
But foreshadowing the social challenges that may emerge as the United States begins to pull out of the yearlong pandemic, the latest poll showed a majority of Americans want to limit the ways in which unvaccinated people can mix in public. 
Seventy-two percent of Americans said it was important to know ""if the people around me have been vaccinated,"" according to the poll.
A majority - 62% - said unvaccinated people should not be allowed to travel on airplanes. Fifty-five percent agreed that unvaccinated people should not work out at public gyms, enter movie theaters or attend public concerts. 
When asked about the workplace, 60% of Americans said they wanted to work for an employer ""who requires everyone to get a coronavirus vaccine before returning to the office"" and 56% thought unvaccinated workers should stay home. 
'DIFFERENT STATUS'
Companies could soon feel increasing pressure to address those concerns. About 18% of the U.S. population has already received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine and President Joe Biden said in a televised speech on Thursday night he would direct states to make all adults eligible for the vaccine by May 1. 
Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the poll responses made sense, given the social restrictions placed on everyone over the past year.
""People are saying: 'If I'm vaccinated, it's going to change my life,'"" Adalja said. ""'And if you're not vaccinated, that's your choice. But you're going to be in a different status because you might be a carrier of this virus, so you could spread it to another unvaccinated person.'""
The poll results were somewhat split along party lines. Republicans, who have been generally less concerned than others over the past year about the coronavirus, were also less supportive than Democrats of workplace and lifestyle restrictions for the unvaccinated, according to the poll. 

Yet even among Republicans, four out of 10 said they supported keeping people without vaccines from going to gyms or movie theaters. Five in 10 Republicans think vaccines should be required for airline travel.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.

722,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 04:05PM ET</span>","Car bomb kills at least 7, injures 53 in Afghanistan's western Herat province","HERAT, Afghanistan (Reuters) - A powerful car bomb near a police station on Friday night killed at least seven people and wounded more than 50 others in Afghanistan's western Herat province, officials said.
Herat Governor Sayed Abdul Wahid Qatali said several women and children were among the dead. He added that at least 53 people including civilians and security forces have been hurt in the explosion.
Dozens of homes and shops were also damaged in the blast as rescuers rushed to the scene to help several people trapped under the rubble, Qatali said. 
No one claimed responsibility for the bombing but local officials blamed the Taliban insurgents. 
Representatives of the Taliban, which has been fighting a foreign-backed Afghan government since they were ousted from power by U.S.-led forces in late 2001, were not immediately available to comment.
Peace negotiations between the Afghan government and insurgent Taliban in Qatar’s capital Doha have struggled to make progress amid international calls to reduce violence. 
Russia plans to hold a conference on Afghanistan in Moscow on March 18 and has invited several regional players, including Afghan government and politicians to jumpstart the peace process as diplomacy by foreign powers including Washington ramps up.
It comes at a crunch time for the peace process as a May 1 deadline for foreign troops to withdraw from Afghanistan looms and the United States reviews its plans.

""Earlier today I learned that the Selection Committee will recommend to the OECD Council that I be appointed as next Secretary-General of the OECD,"" Cormann said in a statement.
Cormann said he looked forward to working with outgoing Secretary-General Ángel Gurría - who has led the organisation for 15 years - through a smooth transition.
Cormann said the OECD would continue to focus on maximising the strength of the economic recovery from COVID-19, to promote ambitious action on climate change and work on finalising a multilateral approach to digital taxation. 

Cormann, who was born in Belgium and migrated to Australia in 1996, has said the OECD must provide leadership on climate change, adding that the targets set in the 2015 Paris Agreement were a foundation to build upon.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Mexico on Friday returned the bodies of 16 Guatemalan nationals massacred in one of its northern border states, a case that caused renewed consternation about the dangers faced by migrants bound for the United States.
The bodies, some badly charred and with gunshot wounds, were found in January along a migrant smuggling route in a remote area of Tamaulipas state in the municipality of Camargo.
Covered with Guatemalan flags, the coffins arrived in the morning in Guatemala City. Relatives who had traveled in the same plane from Mexico City held photographs of the dead.
""I want to express my deepest regret and condolences to the families of the 16 victims of the Camargo massacre,"" Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei said at the airport. ""We will exhaust all the options to find out who was responsible.""
Giammattei asked for a minute of silence before his speech, and expressed his condolences to every family.
Every year, thousands of Central Americans and Mexicans flee poverty and violence to seek a better life in the United States. Many fall victim to crime on the perilous journey.
In this case, no one has been held responsible for the killings. Investigators had said they suspected at least a dozen state police of involvement.
Later in the day, the bodies will be transported to Comitancillo, in western department of San Marcos, to be buried in their place of origin.
Authorities had identified the bodies using DNA samples after relatives of the missing came forward.

Immigration from Central America and Mexico has returned to the forefront of regional affairs since U.S. President Joe Biden took office in January vowing to roll back the hardline policies of his predecessor Donald Trump.

""Diplomacy with Iran is ongoing, just not in a direct fashion at the moment,"" he told reporters.
""There are communications through the Europeans and through others that enable us to explain to the Iranians what our position is with respect to the compliance for compliance approach and to hear what their position is,"" Sullivan added. 
The new administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has rejected giving Tehran unilateral incentives to begin talks but has held out the possibility of both sides taking reciprocal steps to resume implementing the deal, an approach Washington calls ""compliance for compliance.""
""We are waiting at this point to hear further from the Iranians how they would like to proceed,"" Sullivan said. ""This is not going to be easy but we believe that we are in a diplomatic process now that we can move forward on and ultimately secure our objective, which is to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and to do so through diplomacy.""
The United States on Feb. 18 said it was ready to talk to Iran about both nations resuming compliance with the pact that aimed to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons, seeking to revive a deal that Washington itself abandoned in 2018.
Iran began violating the deal in 2019, about a year after former U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from it and reimposed economic sanctions. Tehran has accelerated its breaches in recent months.

Each side has insisted the other go first in returning to the deal, with Tehran demanding Washington remove its economic sanctions and the United States demanding that Iran reinstate limitations on its nuclear program.

NEW YORK/DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Nations World Food Programme is hoping to get a share of hundreds of millions of dollars from a private foundation set up to help Yemen by U.S. private equity investor Tim Collins, U.N. food chief David Beasley said on Friday. 
More than six years of war in Yemen - widely seen as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran - have sent the impoverished country spiraling into what the United Nations describes as the world's largest humanitarian crisis.
In a document shared with aid groups and seen by Reuters, the 2021 Famine Prevention Foundation aims to ""avert a widespread famine by getting immediate assistance to the maximum number of people"" experiencing famine or on the brink of famine.
Beasley said that he has spoken with Collins several times about the foundation, which has yet to be publicly announced.
""Tim's working hard on a private foundation of funds,"" Beasley told reporters. ""He expressed his concerns about the governments around the world being stretched because of the crisis that we're now facing because of COVID.""
Collins, founder of U.S. private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings LLC, declined to comment.
Most funding for U.N. aid appeals comes from governments, so the creation of the Famine Prevention Foundation is novel.
Contributors to the fund are thought to include entities in Gulf countries, an aid source told Reuters. Aid agency Action Contre la Faim told The New Humanitarian media outlet, which first reported on the new fund this month, that the money was thought to have come from private Gulf entities.
""The aim of the fund is to demonstrate that the U.N. can promptly scale up responses when given the means to do so ... it is a way to reassure donors, in particular Gulf donors,"" the aid source said. 
The foundation is being run by John Ging, former director of U.N. aid operations, and Neal Keny-Guyer, the former chief executive of Mercy Corps aid organization, said two sources familiar with the situation.
Earlier this month countries only pledged $1.7 billion for humanitarian aid in Yemen - less than half the $3.85 billion the United Nations was seeking for 2021 to avert a large-scale famine.
DUE DILIGENCE
Beasley estimated the foundation would have sums in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) Yemen director Mohammed Abdi said the group had applied for money from the foundation.
""These funds, if received, will be a much-needed addition to our work,"" he said. ""Far more money is still needed, along with concerted international action to bring about an immediate ceasefire in Yemen and stop pushing millions more into starvation and misery."" 
While it's not clear where the money for the foundation has come from, both Beasley and Abdi said accountability and due diligence had been carried out. 
Abdi said it had received assurances from the foundation that if the Norwegian Refugee Council receives a grant it will be ""free to provide assistance based only on the needs of the most vulnerable.""
Some 80% of Yemenis need help, with 400,000 children under the age of 5 severely malnourished and more than half the population of the Arabian Peninsula country - 16 million people - are going hungry, according to U.N. data. 

A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 after the Iran-aligned Houthi group ousted the country's government from Sanaa. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system. The people's suffering has been worsened by an economic and currency collapse, and by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Escobar-decorated packages were a first in Chile, authorities said, though similar shipments were confiscated by police along the Mosquito coast of Honduras earlier this year. 
""Criminal organizations always put a stamp on (their product), something distinctive, for traceability, to ensure that large shipments reach their destination,"" said Hector Espinosa, director general of Chile's PDI investigative police. 
The bust - unusually large for Chile - also resulted in the arrest of six people, the seizure of 14 vehicles, various weapons, foreign currency and several cellphones. 
The drugs were seized in Chile's northern desert near Arica, a remote, mountainous region that has increasingly become a focal point for smugglers of both contraband and people. 
Police said the product came from Bolivia.
Chile is largely off the beaten track for the region's drug traffickers, but several recent high profile drug-related crimes in the capital Santiago and the desert hinterlands have put authorities in the South American nation on alert. 
Escobar, Colombia's best-known drug lord, was the head of the infamous Medellin cartel. He died during a police operation in 1993.

729,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 02:36PM ET</span>",Israel's Ultra-Orthodox Jews get COVID vaccine but still face resentment,"By Maayan Lubell
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Outside the synagogue in Jerusalem's Ultra-Orthodox neighbourhood Har Nof, a poster bears the name of Osnat Ben Sheetrit, a pregnant mother of four who died of COVID-19, and the words: ""For the ascension of her soul, get vaccinated."" 
The stark message is part of a health ministry campaign aimed at Israel's 1.2 million Ultra-Orthodox Jews, the community that was the hardest hit by the coronavirus but also blamed by many secular Israelis for prolonging the pandemic by ignoring lockdown rules. 
Now the rate of infections among the Haredim, as they are known in Israel, has dropped sharply, falling below the national average for the first time since the pandemic broke out. Cases of severe illness have also dropped, and vaccine take-up is at 72%, a comparatively high rate globally although still below the national rate of 86% in Israel.
The shift comes on the back of a decree from the Haredim's leading rabbis, who for some hold far more authority in their communities than the state, to endorse the vaccine as Israel began its national roll-out in late December. 
""I personally went to rabbinical classes and sat with the rabbis and with the public,"" said Ran Balicer of Clalit, Israel's biggest healthcare provider.
""The bottom line was that the rabbis have declared the rabbinical verdict that the vaccine is safe and effective and should be taken.""
The decision was a turning point for the community ravaged by the virus, where by February, one in every 100 Israeli ultra-Orthodox Jews above the age of 60 had died of COVID-19 - nearly six times higher than among their mainstream peers.
The Haredim, who make up about 12% of Israel's 9.3 million population, comprise 28% of the total recorded 800,000 coronavirus cases, according to Eran Segal, data scientist at Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science. 
However, things are looking up. According to the health ministry, they now make up about the same share of new cases as their relative share of the population, even a little less, and have also seen the largest drop in severe illness than any other sector since a third wave peaked in mid-January.
RESENTMENT
Yet even as Israel's world-leading vaccination rollout begins to haul the country out of the depths of the pandemic, there will be no quick end to the social and political toll on the Ultra-Orthodox.
""When a Haredi man gets on a bus everyone looks at him like he’s a leper so Haredim feel persecuted, there's a lack of empathy toward them,"" said Roni Numa, who heads the health ministry’s ultra-Orthodox task-force.
A protracted electoral stalemate sees Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu going into his fourth election in two years on March 23, with Ultra-Orthodox parties a mainstay of his right-wing coalition.
And although Netanyahu won plaudits at home and abroad for the vaccine rollout, prolonged lockdowns were crippling the economy.
Many blamed the Haredim, some of whose rabbis instructed followers to defy the law and send pupils to class, angering mainstream Israelis, whose schools remained shut.
""You could see (lockdown) violations in every Israeli sector … but what happened in the Haredi community ... is that the violations came from the leadership,"" said Yair Ettinger, a religious affairs analyst for Israel’s public broadcaster Kan.
In addition, Netanyahu was seen as ignoring blatant lockdown violations among the ultra-Orthodox for what critics say are political reasons.
The anger grew when evening news shows aired pictures of mass funerals attended by thousands of Haredim crammed together in the street, and social networks filled with videos of large weddings and holiday celebrations.
Numa said that on the ground the overwhelming majority of the Haredim kept lockdown. Ultra-Orthodox leaders said their community was being unfairly scrutinized. 
Compliance, or a lack thereof, has not been the only factor in how the Haredim fared during the pandemic - it spread fast within the close-knit community whose large families live in densely populated neighbourhoods and towns. 
Shunning secular culture, many ultra-Orthodox were slow to get information about the pandemic that other Israelis got through television, newspapers and the internet.
In addition, with seven children per average ultra-Orthodox family, most often living in a small home, lockdown was a struggle for many of the Haredim who did abide by it. 
""We don’t have Zoom, it was all done over the telephone, every family had to get hold of phones and each child had to find a quiet space in the house,"" Chadad said. 
While most Israeli schoolkids were kept learning remotely in virtual class, the Haredim remained cut off.

But Chadad said the worst was now behind Israel's Haredim. ""We are overcoming coronavirus. With God's help we'll be a light unto the nations and return to normal life quickly.""

730,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 02:25PM ET</span>",Brazil federal prosecutor appeals decision to annul Lula's convictions,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - The office of Brazil's prosecutor general on Friday appealed a Supreme Court judge's ruling earlier this week that annulled the criminal convictions of former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
If successful, the appeal could close the door on the popular politician running in next year's presidential election, which had become a reality after Monday's surprise decision by Justice Edson Fachin.
Two opinion polls published on Friday, the first since Lula's convictions were annulled, showed that President Jair Bolsonaro is still favored to win the 2022 election but his advantage has shrunk, and one said 61% do not approve of his handling of the pandemic that has taken 270,000 lives.
The survey for Exame business news magazine by pollster Ideia found that Bolsonaro would win a run-off against Lula by 7 percentage points if the vote were held today. But another poll by XP (NASDAQ:XP) Investimentos showed him only 2 points ahead of Lula in voter intentions, 27% to 25%, as his approval ratings slip in the world's second-deadliest COVID-19 outbreak.
The prosecutor's office had said on Monday it would appeal. It said Lula's convictions must be upheld in order to preserve ""procedural stability and legal certainty.""
Fachin had ruled that a court in the southern city of Curitiba had lacked the authority to try Lula on corruption charges and that he must be retried in federal courts in the capital Brasilia.
Brazilian media and markets have spent the week dissecting the prospect of an ultra-polarized race between Bolsonaro, a far-right populist, and Lula, his biggest opponent on the left.
The Exame/Ideia poll, which has a margin of error of 3 percentage points, said that 54% of those surveyed opposed the annulment of Lula's convictions.

""Lula has a very good chance of making it to a run-off, but to win he still needs to anesthetize the rejection of Brazil's middle class,"" said Ideia pollster Mauricio Moura.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The Pakistani Taliban on Friday threatened women's rights activists who organised demonstrations to mark International Women's Day in the country, accusing them of blasphemy and obscenity.
The Taliban statement followed a flurry of falsified images and video clips on social media that suggested participants in the March 8 protests had insulted Islam, which they strongly denied.
""We want to send a message to those organisations who are actively spreading obscenity and vulgarity in our beloved Pakistan,"" the statement said, addressing the marchers.
""Fix your ways, there are still many young Muslims here who know how to protect Islam and and the boundaries set by Allah.""
Islamist groups held demonstrations on Friday in several Pakistani cities to demand that the government prosecute the march organisers for blasphemy, and they threatened vigilante action.
Blasphemy carries the death penalty in Pakistan. Although Pakistan has never carried out such a sentence, vigilantes often kill suspects before they are brought before a court.
Messages spread on social media, in some cases shared by journalists and politicians with millions of followers, included false allegations that the French flag was waved at the Women's Day march, while doctored video and audio showed participants chanting slogans viewed as blasphemous against Islamic figures.
'MALICIOUS CAMPAIGN'
""Each and every one of these allegations is completely false and part of a malicious campaign to silence women from speaking out about their rights,"" the march organisers said in a statement.
The Women's Democratic Front, a leftist group founded in 2018 and one of the organisers of the march, said their flag - with red, white and purple stripes - had been misrepresented as the French flag, which has blue, white and red stripes.
Pakistan has seen violent nationwide protests against France over issues such as the Charlie Hebdo cartoons and restrictions on the Islamic veil there for Muslim women.
Hassan Abbas, a security expert at the National Defense University in Washington, said the Taliban statement should be a ""wake-up call"" for Pakistani security agencies.

""(It is aimed at) creating fear, gaining the sympathy of religious radicals and recruiting extremists in urban centres of Pakistan,"" he said.

(Reuters) - The White House is holding onto some doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc's COVID-19 vaccine so they can be given to Americans quickly if authorized by the U.S. health regulator, a top administration official said Friday. 
AstraZeneca has produced doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, where it has yet to be approved. The vaccine developed with Oxford University has been authorized for use in the European Union and many other countries.
Reuters reported this week that U.S. officials told the EU not to expect shipments of the shot from the United States anytime soon. [L1N2L92P1]
""We have a small inventory of AstraZeneca so, if approved, we can get that inventory out to the American people,"" White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeffrey Zients said in a Friday press call.
The New York Times reported this week that tens of millions of doses have already been produced in the United States and are sitting in production facilities unused.
AstraZeneca said in February it expects its vaccine could receive U.S. emergency use authorization at the beginning of April and could immediately deliver 30 million doses to locations around the United States. 
The U.S. stance could jeopardize AstraZeneca’s attempts to come closer to delivering on its contractual obligation with the EU of 180 million doses in the second quarter.
AstraZeneca told the EU earlier this year it would cut its supplies in the second quarter by at least half to less than 90 million doses, EU sources told Reuters, after a bigger reduction in the first three months of the year.
U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday the government will first give Americans COVID-19 vaccines, but any surplus would be shared with the world.
""We...want to make sure we have maximal flexibility, that we are oversupplied and over-prepared and that we have the ability to provide vaccines, whatever the most effective ones are, to the American public,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday. 
""A number of countries... have requested doses from the United States and we have not provided doses from the U.S. government to anyone,"" she added. 
The United States has been one of the world leaders in vaccine administration. It has distributed more than 130 million shots and administered nearly 100 million, according to federal data last updated on Thursday. 

White House officials said on Friday that 65% of Americans over 65 years old have been given shots.

Braving freezing temperatures in her pointe shoes and white tutu, Bagautdinova filmed herself as she performed arabesques and plies on the frozen waters of Batareinaya Bay after she read reports there were plans to build a grain silo at the site. 
The Mariinsky Theatre dancer posted the video online, adding music from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake in a nod to the swans that live in the area about 50 km (30 miles) west of St. Petersburg. 
""This is a unique natural and historical place where swans nest in the spring, where families with children holiday in the summer, where hundreds of fishermen go out onto the ice in the winter,"" she wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""All this is threatened with destruction.""
Russia's TASS news agency reported last year that the Baltic Grain Terminal company planned to start building a 35-billion-rouble ($477 million) terminal on Batareinaya Bay.
Sodruzhestvo, an agro-industrial group that owns Baltic Grain Terminal, declined to comment.
The Leningrad regional authority told Reuters it had not issued any construction permit to build in the area.
Bagautdinova called on Russians to sign an online petition addressed to President Vladimir Putin calling for the bay to be left in its natural state. The petition has so far garnered more than 7,650 signatures. 
""It was my cry from the heart to save an amazing place that has a special meaning for me,"" the 29-year-old told Reuters.
Bagautdinova said her family often visited the bay's sandy beaches in the summer and sleighed there in the winter.
""It would be great if after I danced here, the construction would stop and we could save this amazing natural place,"" Bagautdinova said. ""But I don't think it's that easy.""

On Wednesday, Lula gave an impassioned speech in the labor union where his political career took off in the 1980s, which had the feel of a campaign launch ahead of next year's presidential election. However, he said he had not decided whether to run. 
""I celebrate that the country's authorities have exonerated"" former President Lula, Lopez Obrador said at his daily morning news conference. ""He was imprisoned and faced a whole campaign against him and against the movement he represented."" 
Lopez Obrador has repeatedly rejected the concept of ""intervention"" from other countries but has previously lent a hand to left-wing leaders, including former Bolivian president Evo Morales during a contested election. 
He has warm relations with like-minded governments in Argentina and Bolivia, but has rarely talked about Brazil's current president, right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro. 
Lula, 75, governed Latin America's biggest country and largest economy between 2003 and 2011, overseeing a commodities boom that turbocharged economic growth.

In 2018, he was convicted of taking bribes from engineering companies in return for public contracts and spent a year and a half behind bars.

Lebanon's economic crisis is posing the biggest threat to its stability since the 1975-1990 civil war. 
Erupting in late 2019, it has since wiped out jobs, locked people out of their bank deposits, slashed 85% of the value of its currency and raised the risk of widespread hunger.
""In light of the terrible failure of those in power socially and politically we are going to the streets to ask for a new independent government and an alternative to the current system,"" a statement by one group of protesters said. 
Lebanon's problems were compounded after a port explosion in August devastated whole tracts of Beirut, killing 200 people and prompting the government to resign, leaving the country rudderless as it sinks deeper into financial collapse. 
Prime Minister Hassan Diab's cabinet has stayed on in a caretaker capacity until a new cabinet is formed. 
But prime minister-designate Saad al-Hariri, nominated in October, is at loggerheads with President Michel Aoun and has been unable to form a new government to carry out much needed reforms to unlock international aid. 
""We are hungry. It is that simple. That is why we are taking part here,"" said one protester on the streets with his family who declined to be named.
The protest comes after two days of relative calm since nationwide roadblocks persisted for more than a week as groups of demonstrators, angry at the currency's tumble to a new low, burnt tyres to block streets. 
Several caretaker ministers have made alarming public remarks in the past week about the state of Lebanon's security and finances. 
Interior minister Mohammed Fahmy said security had all but broken down with ""all possibilities open"", while energy minister Raymond Ghajar warned that cash for power generation was running out fast and Lebanon could be in total darkness by end of month.
Despite the warnings, there has been no movement on the political front. 
The lack of action prompted French foreign minister Jean-Yves le Drian to say that time was running out to prevent Lebanon collapsing and he could see no sign that the country's politicians were doing what they could to save it.

France has spearheaded international efforts to rescue the former French protectorate, trying to use Paris' historical influence to persuade squabbling politicians to adopt a reform roadmap.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft are at knives drawn. 
Driven in part by pressure from lawmakers and regulators over the extraordinary power the two technology companies wield over American life, the California-based search engine giant and Washington-based software firm are wrestling to throw each other under the bus.
Tensions between  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet-owned Google have been simmering for a while but the rivalry has become unusually public in recent days as executives from both firms have been put on the defensive over competing crises.
Google faces bipartisan complaints - and journalistic ire - over its role in gutting the media industry's advertisement revenue, the subject of a Congressional antitrust hearing on Friday.
Microsoft, meanwhile, faces scrutiny for its role in back-to-back cybersecurity breaches. 
In the first, the same allegedly Russian hackers who compromised the Texas software firm SolarWinds Corp also took advantage of Microsoft's cloud software to break into some of the company's clients. The second, disclosed on March 2, saw allegedly Chinese hackers abuse previously unknown vulnerabilities to vacuum up emails from Microsoft customers around the world.
Addressing lawmakers on Friday at a House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee on news, Microsoft President Brad Smith was due to fire a shot at Google, telling representatives that media organizations are being forced to ""use Google's tools, operate on Google's ad exchanges, contribute data to Google's operations, and pay Google money,"" according to excerpts of his testimony published by Axios.

Google fired back, saying that Microsoft's ""newfound interest in attacking us comes on the heels of the SolarWinds attack and at a moment when they've allowed tens of thousands of their customers — including government agencies in the U.S., NATO allies, banks, nonprofits, telecommunications providers, public utilities, police, fire and rescue units, hospitals and, presumably, news organizations — to be actively hacked via major Microsoft vulnerabilities.""

Sahayb Abu, 27, ordered weapons, equipment and clothing online in preparation for an attack, the police said, and was detained in an armed police operation after ordering a large sword online.
""Over several months, Abu sought to obtain weapons and the equipment needed to commit a terrorist attack,"" said Richard Smith, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command. 
""He is an extremely dangerous individual, but we were able to intervene and arrest him before he was able to carry out his attack.""
Police seized electronic devices from Abu when he was arrested on July 9, and found video and voice messages where Abu recited lyrics describing himself as a ""straight ISIS supporter"" and referring to having a suicide vest.
Abu had denied planning a terrorist attack and said equipment he had purchased was for parody ""drill"" music videos, a form of rap that focuses on violence and crime. 
He is due to be sentenced on April 9.

(Reuters) - Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr said on Friday he will not seek re-election in November, making it likely that his criminal investigation into former U.S. President Donald Trump will be left for his successor.
The decision by Vance, 66, not to seek a fourth term raises questions about the potential timing for the probe into Trump, who remains popular among many Republicans and if indicted would be the first former president to face criminal prosecution.
That probe has accelerated since Republican Trump lost his bid for a second term to President Joe Biden, a Democrat.
It got a big boost last month when Vance's office finally obtained eight years of Trump's tax returns after an 18-month court battle, including two trips to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Trump's accountants at Mazars USA LLP turned over millions of pages of documents including the tax returns, business records and communications.
Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and fixer, told Reuters he was going on Wednesday for a seventh interview with Vance's office as part of the investigation.
Vance's office has said in court filings it was investigating ""possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct"" at the former president's Trump Organization, including tax and insurance fraud and falsification of business records.
At least nine candidates have said they want to succeed Vance, who won his first term in 2009.
Vance gave no specific reason for his decision not to run again. ""I never imagined myself as District Attorney for decades like my predecessors,"" he said in a statement. He had succeeded Robert Morgenthau, who over 35 years made the office a major crime-fighting agency in the country.
Vance has overseen many high-profile cases, including last year's conviction of Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein on rape and sexual assault charges.

Trump is also being investigated in Georgia for allegedly trying to overturn that state's 2020 election results, a step that could lead to a criminal investigation by state and local authorities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. health officials will limit the information they share with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) to try to persuade more parents and relatives of unaccompanied migrant children to come forward and take the minors into custody, U.S. officials said on Friday during a call with reporters. 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and ICE will roll back a 2018 information-sharing agreement between the agencies as part of U.S. President Joe Biden's plan to deal with a rising number of children arriving at the border, the officials said. 
Immigrant advocates had criticized the agreement, saying it discouraged potential sponsors from coming forward due to fears they or their family members could be deported.
""This makes really clear that this administration prioritizes uniting a child with their family member or sponsor,"" one official said on the call.
The number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border has climbed in recent months as Biden, a Democrat, has reversed some of the restrictive policies put in place by former President Donald Trump, a Republican.
More than 3,600 migrant children were being held in U.S. border facilities as of Thursday morning, a U.S. official told Reuters, more than four times the number in late February. The increase signals a growing humanitarian and political crisis for the Biden administration seven weeks into his presidency.
Biden faces pressure from Republicans and some Democrats to address the rising border arrests, but his administration does not currently plan to seek additional funding from Congress, another one of the officials said on Friday.

HHS will continue to share sponsors' home addresses with ICE through a discharge form related to a child's immigration court case, according to two people familiar with the matter.

PARIS (Reuters) - Dozens of show business workers are occupying theatres in at least nine cities in France to demand President Emmanuel Macron's government reopen cultural venues and end a months-long halt to performances because of the coronavirus pandemic.
At the Odeon Theatre on the Left Bank in Paris, the sit-in entered its eighth day on Friday as protesters rejected an additional financial support for cultural venues and artists pledged by the government a day earlier.
Sleeping bags, inflatable mattresses and donated food are laid out in the 19th-century theatre's ornate hall and velvet-lined balconies, while the 54 protesters share a single shower.
""We've got everything we need to sit tight for several days,"" said comedian Jennifer Catelain. 
""We started with polite petitions, then peaceful protests, we occupied venues for a day here and there, but we were not listened to. So we decided to step it up, stay a little longer in a place that is emblematic."" 
Theatres, cinemas, art galleries and other cultural spaces have been shut since October when France was put into its second full lockdown. Much of the economy reopened in mid-December but cultural venues, like bars and restaurants, remained closed.
The protesters, among them actors, theatre workers and students, say there is no reason to keep cultural venues closed when social distancing measures can be imposed. 
They have been demanding an opening date as well as an extension to special unemployment benefits for actors, musicians and other show business workers who work on short-term contracts, known collectively as ""intermittents du spectacle"".
The government on Thursday promised an extra 30 million euros in financial aid and made sick leave and maternity leave more widely available for intermittents during the crisis.
However the protesters said the response did not go far enough - and for now the public appears on their side. 

""They have no choice when it seems they have no other solution, said Paris resident Beatrice Philippe.

After 12 people were killed on Thursday in one of the bloodiest days since the Feb. 1 coup, the British foreign office warned that ""political tension and unrest are widespread since the military takeover and levels of violence are rising"". 
Friday's protests came as South Korea said it would suspend defence exchanges and reconsider development aid to Myanmar because of the violence.
More than 70 protesters have now been killed in the Southeast Asian nation since the military seized power, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) advocacy group said. 
Memorials were held for some of them on Friday, including one man whose family said his body had been taken by the security forces and not returned. 
A spokesman for the junta did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment.
""Despite repeated demands of the international community, including South Korea, there are an increasing number of victims in Myanmar due to violent acts of the military and police authorities,"" South Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement.
It said Seoul would suspend defence exchanges, ban arms exports, limit exports of other strategic items, reconsider development aid and grant humanitarian exemptions allowing Myanmar nationals to stay in South Korea until the situation improved.
Protests were held in Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city, and several other towns on Friday, photographs posted on social media by witnesses and news organisations showed. Many were dispersed by security forces. 
Poland's foreign ministry said a Polish journalist was arrested, the second foreign reporter to be detained. A Japanese journalist was briefly held while covering a protest. 
Riot police and armed soldiers entered the general hospital in Hakha, in the western Chin state, forcing all 30 patients to leave and evicting staff from on-site housing, said local activist Salai Lian. 
Soldiers have been occupying hospitals and universities across Myanmar as they try to quash a civil disobedience movement that started with government employees like doctors and teachers but has expanded into a general strike that has paralysed many sectors of the economy. 
The country has been in crisis since the army ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government last month, detained her and officials of her National League for Democracy party, and set up a ruling junta of generals.
Junta spokesman Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun said on Thursday Suu Kyi had accepted gold and illegal payments worth $600,000 while in government. He said Phyo Min Thein, a former chief minister of Yangon, who is also in jail, had admitted making the payments.
Adding corruption charges to the accusations facing Suu Kyi, 75, could bring her a harsher penalty. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate currently faces four comparatively minor charges, such as illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios and flouting coronavirus curbs.
""This accusation is the most hilarious joke,"" Suu Kyi's lawyer Khin Maung Zaw said on social media on Friday. ""She might have other weaknesses but she doesn't have weakness in moral principle."" 
'CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY'
Thursday's dead included eight people killed when security forces fired on a protest in the central town of Myaing, the AAPP said. 
Chit Min Thu was killed in the North Dagon district of Yangon. His wife, Aye Myat Thu, told Reuters he had insisted on joining the protests despite her appeals that he stay at home for the sake of their son.
""He said it's worth dying for,"" she said through her tears. ""He is worried about people not joining the protest. If so, democracy will not return."" 
The bloodshed came hours after the U.N. Security Council had called for restraint from the army.
U.N. human rights investigator Thomas Andrews on Friday dismissed as ""absurd"" comments by a senior Myanmar official that authorities were exercising ""utmost restraint"". Addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, he called for a united approach to ""strip away the junta's sense of impunity.""
The army did not respond to requests for comment on the latest deaths, but junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said on Thursday the security forces were disciplined and used force only when necessary.
Rights group Amnesty International accused the army of using lethal force against protesters and said many killings it had documented amounted to extra-judicial executions.
Suu Kyi fought for decades to overturn military rule under previous juntas before tentative democratic reforms began in 2011. She had spent a total of about 15 years under house arrest.
The army has justified taking power by saying that a November election, overwhelmingly won by Suu Kyi's party, was marred by fraud - an assertion rejected by the electoral commission. 

The junta has said a state of emergency will last for a year, but has not set a date for the election.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden met leaders of Australia, India and Japan on Friday, a group central to his efforts to counter China's growing military and economic power, and said a free and open Indo-Pacific region was crucial to all of them.
The White House says the virtual meeting of the countries known as the Quad, the first at leader level, shows the importance Biden places on the Indo-Pacific region and that it will focus on tackling the coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis, and on reviving economic growth.
""A free and open Indo Pacific is essential to each of our futures,"" Biden told the meeting from the White House. ""The United States is committed to working with you, our partners, and all our allies in the region, to achieve stability."" Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he wanted the four ""to forge strongly ahead toward the realization of a free and open Indo-Pacific"".
India and Australia also emphasized the importance of regional security cooperation, which has been enhanced by previous lower-level Quad meetings.
A senior U.S. official told reporters Friday's meeting would involve ""an honest, open discussion about China's role on the global stage,"" referencing ""challenges in the region"" to free and open trade and commerce.
The Biden administration has said the Quad nations will announce financing agreements to support an increase in manufacturing capacity for coronavirus vaccines in India, something New Delhi has called for to counter Beijing's widening vaccine diplomacy.
U.S. officials say the countries will also set up a group of experts to help distribute vaccines in the region, as well as working groups for cooperation on climate change, technology standards, and joint development of emerging technologies. 
The United States wants to strengthen ties with allies and partners as China adopts an increasingly assertive foreign policy in Asia and beyond. Washington says the additional vaccine capacity will be used in immunization efforts in Southeast Asia, where Beijing is competing for influence.
The virtual meeting, which also included Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi, aims to lay the groundwork for an in-person meeting later this year, the administration said.
Modi told the session the Quad had ""come of age"" and would ""now remain an important pillar of stability in the region"".
'WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF COOPERATION'
Earlier, Morrison told reporters: ""When governments come together at the highest level, this shows a whole new level of cooperation to create a new anchor for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.""
Among the issues to be addressed are supply chains exposed as heavily reliant on China during the pandemic.
Japan's Nikkei newspaper reported on Thursday that the four countries would also work together to secure rare earth metals essential for electric car motors and other products.
The Biden administration told Reuters on Tuesday the United States and Japan would help fund Indian firms manufacturing vaccines for U.S. drugmakers  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc and J&J (NYSE:JNJ).
However, Indian government sources say U.S. curbs on exports of critical materials could hamper that effort and those to start large-scale distribution to Southeast Asia.
A second senior administration official told reporters Washington's focus was foremost on getting vaccines to Americans, adding: ""We will not be talking about sharing vaccines right now.""
India, Australia and Japan have all faced security challenges from China, strengthening their interest in the Quad. Quad cooperation dates back to their joint response to the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
The Quad was revived under the Trump administration, which saw it as a vehicle to push back against China. The United States hosted a foreign ministers' meeting in 2019, which was followed by another in Japan last year and a virtual session in February.
Friday's meeting coincides with a major U.S. diplomatic drive to solidify alliances in Asia and Europe to counter China, including visits next week by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Japan and South Korea.
Blinken will also meet in Alaska with China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and State Councillor Wang Yi - the first high-level in-person contact between the world's two largest economies under the Biden administration.

Washington has said it will not hold back in its criticism of Beijing over issues ranging from Taiwan to Hong Kong and the genocide it says China is committing against minority Muslims.

One of Navalny's lawyers confirmed that Navalny was no longer being held at the Kolchugino jail in the Vladimir region northeast of Moscow, but said the legal team had not been told where he had been taken.
TASS, quoting an unidentified law enforcement official, said it was to the nearby IK-2 penal colony. A spokeswoman for the Federal Penitentiary Service said she could not disclose information on Navalny's whereabouts because of laws protecting personal information.
Navalny's supporters used the Russian hashtag #WhereisNavalny, writing on Twitter that the move was designed to prevent his lawyers and family from reaching him.
Navalny, 44, one of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critics, was jailed for parole violations in a decision that the West has condemned as politically motivated.
He returned to Russia in January from Germany where he had been recuperating after falling ill from what German authorities say was poisoning by a banned nerve agent. The Kremlin has denied involvement in his illness.
Vadim Kobzev, one of Navalny's lawyers, said he had visited Navalny at Kolchugino on Thursday, but that another lawyer had tried to see him on Friday only to be told that he was no longer at the jail. 
""The prison said he wasn't there and that's it,"" Kobzev told Reuters, adding that Navalny was in good health when he had visited him the previous day.

Western countries have called for Navalny's release, and the United States and European Union have imposed sanctions against Russian officials over the case.

The ship, Shahr e Kord, was slightly damaged in Wednesday's incident by an explosive object which caused a small fire, but no one on board was hurt, the spokesman, Ali Ghiasian, said, according to state media.
""Such terrorist acts amount to naval piracy, and are contrary to international law on commercial shipping security, and legal action will be taken to identify the perpetrators through relevant international institutions,"" Ghiasian said.
The vessel was headed to Europe when the attack occurred and will leave for its destination after repairs, he added.
The Iranian-flagged vessel last reported its position off Syria’s coast on March 10 as it headed for the Syrian port of Latakia, Refinitiv ship tracking data showed.
Two maritime security sources said initial indications were that the Iranian container ship had been intentionally targeted by an unknown source. 
The incident comes two weeks after an Israeli-owned ship the MV HELIOS RAY was hit by an explosion in the Gulf of Oman. 
The cause was not immediately clear, although a U.S. defence official said the blast left holes in both sides of the vessel's hull. Israel accused Iran of being behind the explosion, a charge the Islamic Republic denied.
On Friday, Israeli officials did not provide comment when asked if Israel was involved in the Shahr e Kord incident reported by Iran.
A third maritime security source told Reuters that three other Iranian ships had been damaged in recent weeks by unknown causes when sailing through the Red Sea. 
SMUGGLING
Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal reported that Israel has targeted at least a dozen vessels bound for Syria and mostly carrying Iranian oil out of concern that petroleum profits are funding terrorism in the Middle East.
Israeli officials declined comment on the report, which cited unnamed U.S. and regional officials and came as the Biden administration reviews policy on Iran. The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem had no immediate comment.
In a speech to Israeli navy cadets in 2019, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran of increased oil smuggling by sea to circumvent U.S. sanctions, and said the navy corps would ""have a more important role in blocking these Iranian actions"".
He did not elaborate on what that might entail.
Israel has separately said it is waging a covert “campaign between wars” to deny Iranian allies on its borders arms and other support from Tehran.
“We do not comment on the campaign we are waging, in the operational regard,” Israeli security cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi told Tel Aviv radio 102 FM when asked about the Journal report.
“But we always emphasize (that) we must be poised against Iranian belligerence on all fronts...and I suppose this also includes the air and sea arenas, as well as on land.”
The Israeli navy, whose largest vessels are missile corvettes and five diesel-fuelled submarines, is mostly active in the Mediterranean and Red seas.

Ties between the two countries soured in 2018 when Australia became the first nation to publicly ban China's Huawei from its 5G network and worsened when Australia last year called for an inquiry into the origins of the novel coronavirus.
In a statement to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, China alleged that the detention centres ""fall short of adequate medical conditions where a large number of immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers have been detained over a long period of time or even indefinitely, and their human rights have been violated.""
It did not specify any locations, describing them as ""third countries"". Asylum seekers intercepted at sea en route to Australia are sent for ""processing"" to Papua New Guinea or to the South Pacific island of Nauru.
Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside normal working hours.
China itself has long faced accusations that it operates detention centres, with UN experts and rights groups estimating it has detained more than a million people in its Xinjiang region, mostly Uighurs and other Muslim minorities, in a vast system of camps.
China has described the camps as vocational centres designed to combat extremism.
""We urge Australia to immediately close down all offshore detention centers and take concrete steps to protect the rights of immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, especially children,"" China said in its statement, which it submitted on behalf of a group of unnamed countries.
It also called on Australia to carry out ""comprehensive and fair investigations"" into reported cases of ""serious war crimes"" committed by Australian troops overseas.
An Australian inquiry published in November said Australian special forces were suspected of killing 39 unarmed prisoners and civilians in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016, drawing criticism from China's foreign ministry.

Speaking at an inoculation centre at Rome's Fiumicino airport, Draghi also played down health concerns about the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine, which some countries have suspended following the deaths of a handful of people who had taken it.
""I will propose to parliament ... a new increase in the deficit,"" said Draghi, who took office a month ago at the head of a government of national unity. 
Rome's most recent estimate was for a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 8.8% this year, down only slightly from 9.5% in 2020 when the economy shrank by 8.9%, Italy's steepest recession since World War Two.
Draghi spoke shortly after the cabinet approved a decree ordering a nationwide lockdown over the Easter weekend. It also toughened curbs on economic activity and freedom of movement from Monday to try to rein in a rise in COVID-19 infections.
Italy has reported more than 100,000 deaths from the disease since discovering its first cases 13 months ago, the seventh highest toll worldwide.
Draghi said a new decree to be presented next week will extend furlough schemes, bolster income support for the poor and simplify procedures to compensate firms whose revenue have been hit by COVID closures.
This package of measures, worth 32 billion euros ($38.17 billion), was already budgeted for by the previous government, while Draghi said he would ask parliament in April for authorisation to increase spending further.
Draghi said Italy's medicines authority believed there was no link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and recent deaths of people who had taken it, which prompted Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Bulgaria to suspend the vaccine and Italy to block a batch.
Italy is currently vaccinating some 170,000 people per day, the prime minister said, adding: ""The goal is to triple that quickly.""
Amid reports of many Italians managing to get vaccinated ahead of the elderly and chronically sick, Draghi appealed for a sense of responsibility.
""I ask everyone to wait their turn,"" he said, citing the example of the 79-year-old head of state Sergio Mattarella, who was only vaccinated this week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A ""sound plan"" for a nationwide ceasefire in Yemen has been before Houthi leadership for ""a number of days,"" but it appears the group is prioritizing a military offensive to take Marib, the U.S. special envoy on Yemen, Tim Lenderking, said on Friday.
""I will return immediately when the Houthis are prepared to talk,"" Lenderking told the Atlantic Council think tank after a visit to the region to revive efforts to end the six-year conflict that is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. 
""The U.S. and U.N. - we urge the Houthis to respond,"" he said. ""If we cannot make progress now, the country will spiral into greater conflict and instability.""
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 after the Iran-allied Houthi group ousted the country's government from the capital Sanaa. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system. 
""We now have a sound plan for a nationwide ceasefire with elements that would immediately address Yemen's dire humanitarian situation directly,"" Lenderking said. ""That plan has been before the Houthi leadership for a number of days."" 
The Houthis, however, have recently pushed toward the gas-rich region of Marib, aiming to take the government's last stronghold in the north of Yemen. The United Nations has warned that millions of civilians are at risk. 
""Tragically, and somewhat confusingly for me, it appears that the Houthis are prioritizing a military campaign to take Marib ... over suspending the war and moving relief to the Yemeni people,"" Lenderking said. 
He announced that the United States would restore humanitarian aid funding for northern Yemen, and said Washington would work with the governments of Yemen and Saudi Arabia to find a way to deliver fuel to the Yemenis who need it most.
The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. 
Some 80% of Yemenis need help, with 400,000 children under the age of 5 severely malnourished, according to U.N. data. For much of its food, the country relies on imports that have been badly disrupted over the years by all warring parties.

The people's suffering has been worsened by an economic and currency collapse, and by the COVID-19 pandemic.

KADUNA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Gunmen kidnapped around 30 students in an overnight raid on a forestry college in northwest Nigeria, an official said on Friday, the fourth mass school abduction since December in a country where violence is on the increase.
An armed gang broke into the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization, located on the outskirts of Kaduna city near a military academy, at around 11:30 p.m. (2230 GMT) on Thursday, Kaduna state's security commissioner, Samuel Aruwan said.
After a distress call, the army rescued 180 people in the early hours of Friday but ""about 30 students, a mix of males and females, are yet to be accounted for"", he said.
""A combined team of army, air force, police and DSS (Department of State Services) troops are conducting an operation to track the missing students.""
The city is the capital of Kaduna state, part of a region where banditry has festered for years. Hours before the kidnapping, Nigeria's federal government said it would ""take out"" abductors after earlier criticising local deals to free victims.
Kaduna resident Haruna Salisu said he had heard sporadic gunshots at around 11:30 p.m. on Thursday from the area of the compound, where the concrete perimeter wall had a large hole in it on Friday.
""We were not panicking, thinking that it was a normal military exercise being conducted at the (nearby) Nigerian Defence Academy,"" he said by phone.
""We came out for dawn prayers, at 5:20 a.m., and saw some of the students, teachers and security personnel all over the school premises. They told us that gunmen raided the school and abducted some of the students.""
On Friday morning, relatives of students gathered at the gates of the college, which was surrounded by around 20 army trucks.
RANSOM
The trend of abduction from boarding schools was started by the jihadist group Boko Haram, which seized 270 schoolgirls from a school at Chibok in the northeast in 2014. Around 100 of them have never been found.
Armed criminal gangs seeking ransom have since carried out copycat attacks. 
Within the last few weeks, 279 schoolgirls were freed after being abducted from their boarding school at Jangebe in northwest Nigeria's Zamfara state. In the north-central state of Niger, 27 teenage boys were released after being kidnapped from their school, along with three staff and 12 family members. One student was shot dead in that attack.
Military and police attempts to tackle the gangs have had little success, while many worry that state authorities are making the situation worse by letting kidnappers go unpunished, paying them off or providing incentives. 
In Zamfara, state government officials said they had given 'reformed bandits' access to land for cattle grazing, while also building schools and medical facilities. They do not specifically identify the recipients as kidnappers. 
In late February, the presidency said President Muhammadu Buhari had urged state governments to ""review their policy of rewarding bandits with money and vehicles, warning that the policy might boomerang disastrously"".
Buhari held talks with security officials and traditional leaders on Thursday to discuss the country's multiple security challenges. The national security adviser, Babagana Monguno, after the talks said the government would take a tough stance on criminal gangs.
""The new direction of government is to come out with full force. We have decided to apply the full weight of the law. We will come down on them wherever we locate them and take them out,"" he told reporters in the capital, Abuja, without providing further details. 

The unrest has become a political problem for Buhari, a retired general and former military ruler who has faced mounting criticism over the rise in violent crime, and replaced his long-standing military chiefs earlier this year.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States on Friday condemned China's abuse of ethnic and religious minorities, including what it called ""crimes against humanity and genocide"" in Xinjiang against Muslim Uighurs and severe restrictions in Tibet.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who meets his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Alaska next week, is due to raise the treatment of Uighurs, U.S. officials have said.
China rejects U.S. charges that it has committed genocide against Uighur and other Muslims in the remote western region, where activists say more than 1 million are held in internment camps.
""We condemn China's abuse of members of ethnic and religious minority groups including crimes against humanity and genocide in Xinjiang and severe restrictions in Tibet,"" Mark Cassayre, U.S. charge d'affaires, told the U.N. Human Rights Council.
Chen Xu, China's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, did not refer directly to Xinjiang in a speech saying that his country opposed politicisation of human rights issues.
Cuba, speaking on behalf of 64 countries including China, said Xinjiang is ""an inseparable part of China"" and urged states to ""stop interfering in China’s internal affairs by manipulating Xinjiang-related issues, (and) refrain from making unfounded allegations against China out of political motivations"".
Britain's ambassador, Julian Braithwaite, told the forum: ""We remain deeply concerned by the extensive and systematic human rights violations in Xinjiang, including credible reports of forced labour and forced birth control.""
China says the complexes it set up in Xinjiang provide vocational training to help stamp out Islamist extremism and separatism. Allegations of forced labour and human rights violations are “groundless rumour and slander”, the Chinese foreign ministry says.
Cassayre and Braithwaite raised concerns about Hong Kong, where 21 activists are to remain in custody after a court on Friday rejected requests by some for bail.
The charges against a total of 47 opposition figures represent the most sweeping use yet of Hong Kong's new security law, which punishes what it broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.

""We condemn Hong Kong authorities' detention of democratic activists for exercising their rights and freedoms and call for their immediate release,"" Cassayre said.

754,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 10:11AM ET</span>","Britain is legitimate owner of Parthenon marbles, UK's Johnson tells Greece","ATHENS (Reuters) - Britain is the legitimate owner of the Parthenon marbles, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a Greek newspaper, rebuffing Greece's permanent request for the return of the 2,500-year-old sculptures. 
Since independence in 1832, Greece has repeatedly called for the repatriation of the treasures - known in Britain as the Elgin Marbles - that British diplomat Lord Elgin removed from the Parthenon temple in Athens in the early 19th century, when Greece was under Ottoman rule. 
But the British Museum in London has refused to return the sculptures, roughly half of a 160-meter (525-foot) frieze which adorned the 5th century BC monument, saying they were acquired by Elgin under a legal contract with the Ottoman Empire and are part of everyone's ""shared heritage"".
In an interview with Ta Nea newspaper released on Friday, Johnson, a former student of the Classics much given to quoting Latin and Greek, reiterated that the British Museum was the legitimate owner of the marbles.
He said he understood the feelings of many Greeks about the issue but said Britain had a ""firm and long-standing"" position about the sculptures. ""They were acquired legally by Lord Elgin, in line with the laws that were in force at that time,"" he said.
Greece's conservative government has stepped up pressure for a return of the marbles since it took power in 2019, a campaign it has said would be intensified by Britain's departure from the European Union.
Greece's Culture Minister Lina Mendoni last year branded Elgin a ""serial thief"" who used illegal tactics to take the marbles.

In 2019, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told Britain's Observer newspaper he would be willing to lend important artefacts to London in return for putting the marbles on display in Athens in 2021, when Greece marks the 200th anniversary of the start of its War of Independence.

ROME (Reuters) - Former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta announced on Friday he would seek the leadership of the troubled centre-left Democratic Party (PD), seven years after he was ousted from power in a party coup.
The PD, one of the largest groups supporting Mario Draghi's unity government, was thrown into turmoil last week when its leader Nicola Zingaretti quit, saying he was ""ashamed"" of internal wrangling over key positions.
His abrupt walkout has triggered a PD slump in the polls and many party stalwarts have turned to Letta, who has been living in Paris in recent years, asking if he would return to Italy and try to revive the centre-left's fortunes.
In a video posted on Twitter, Letta confirmed widespread speculation that he would stand as a candidate to lead the party at a PD assembly called for Sunday.
No other PD politician has yet put themselves forward for the top job, and Letta is widely expected to be nominated.
""Frankly I would never have imagined last Monday that today I would be here to announce my candidacy for the leadership of the Democratic Party, a party that I helped to found and which is now going through a deep crisis,"" Letta said.
""I am doing it out of a love of politics and a passion for democratic values.""
Moderate and pro-European, Letta led a coalition in 2013-2014 that combined centre-left and centre-right parties. He was unceremoniously booted out of office by party rival Matteo Renzi, who said Italy needed more ambitious government.
Livid at his downfall, Letta moved to France where he became director of the Jacques Delors Institute think tank and dean of the Paris School of International Affairs at Sciences Po.
He let his membership of the PD lapse, but started paying his dues again in 2019 after Renzi quit the group to set up his own breakaway party, which registers less than 3% in the polls.

Support for the PD fell almost 2 percentage points after Zingaretti resigned, hitting just 16.6% in one survey, making it the fourth largest group in Italy behind the 5-Star Movement, and two rightist parties, the League and the Brothers of Italy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Myanmar's first satellite is being held on board the International Space Station following the Myanmar coup, while Japan's space agency and a Japanese university decide what to do with it, two Japanese university officials said.
The $15 million satellite was built by Japan's Hokkaido University in a joint project with Myanmar's government-funded Myanmar Aerospace Engineering University (MAEU). It is the first of a set of two 50 kg microsatellites equipped with cameras designed to monitor agriculture and fisheries.
Human rights activists and some officials in Japan worry that those cameras could be used for military purposes by the junta that seized power in Myanmar on Feb. 1.
That has put the deployment on hold, as Hokkaido University holds discussions with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the two Hokkaido University officials said. 
""We won't get involved in anything that has to do with the military. The satellite was not designed for that,"" one of the officials, a manager of the project, told Reuters, asking not to be identified.
""We are discussing what to do, but we don't know when it will be deployed. If it is halted, our hope is that the project could be restarted at some point."" 
The manager did not say when the satellite was meant to be deployed, or when a decision would have to be taken by JAXA either to go ahead or delay it.
The second Hokkaido University official said the contract with MAEU did not specify that the satellite cannot be used for military purposes. However, data from the spacecraft would be collected by the Japanese university and cannot be independently accessed by Myanmar officials, the second official said.
Since the coup, university officials had been unable to contact the rector of MAEU, Prof Kyi Thwin, the second official added.
Officials at JAXA could not be reached for comment. MAEU did not respond to calls seeking comment, nor did a spokesman for Myanmar's junta.
The satellite was launched by NASA on Feb 20 as a small part of a large and varied payload of supplies to the International Space Station 400 km (250 miles) above the earth. It has since been kept by JAXA inside Japan's Kibo experiment module. JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi is one of the seven crew members now on board the space station.
Japan has close ties to Myanmar and is one of its biggest aid donors. While condemning the violence, it has not taken as hard a stance against the coup as the United States and some other Western countries which have applied sanctions.
While the spacecraft has not been built to military specifications, Teppei Kasai, Asia programme officer for Human Rights Watch, said it would be easy for Myanmar's army rulers to appropriate the technology for military use.

""So the involved Japanese universities should suspend the project and urgently review it for potential human rights risks,"" Kasai said.

State minister, Issam ben Saeed, was appointed acting minister.
Haj and Umrah, which generated billions of dollars each year before the pandemic, is a major source of income for the Saudi government. 
""Mohammed Saleh ben Taher Benten, Minister of Haj and Umrah shall be relieved form his position,"" SPA said in a tweet, without giving reasons behind the decision. Benten was appointed minister in 2016.
The kingdom, which stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam’s holiest sites in Mecca and Medina and its peaceful organisation of the haj, sharply scaled back last year's haj to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, after barring Muslims abroad from the rite for the first time in modern times.
Companies operating in the sector have been hit hard by the government's preventive measures. Before the pandemic, more than 1,300 hotels and hundreds of stores buzzed around the clock to cater to pilgrims visiting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.
Earlier this week, Jabal Omar Development Company, one of Saudi Arabia's largest listed property developers, secured 1.6 billion riyals ($427 million) in loans from Banque Saudi Fransi backed by a Finance Ministry guarantee, after being hit hard by the Mecca lockdown. 
Earlier this week, SPA said King Salman approved a range of initiatives aimed at assisting firms and individuals operating in the sector to mitigate COVID-related financial and economic effects they incurred during the lockdown. 
Separately, the royal decrees also included relieving the head of the General Aviation Authority, Abdulhadi al-Mansouri, from his position and appointing him at a foreign ministry post.

Abdulaziz al-Duaelij was appointed as new head of the aviation authority.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's new oversight of digital news platforms is drawing protest from the media industry and activists who fear the rules will curb press freedom in the world's largest democracy.
India, which has one of the world's biggest and most diverse media industries, last month announced the Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code, aimed at pushing Big Tech firms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to comply with content takedown orders. However, it also extends to news websites.
The rules impose a three-tier regulatory mechanism, requiring a grievance officer to resolve complaints and a government panel to have broad oversight. The most senior government official in the information and broadcasting ministry will also have emergency powers to order content be blocked. 
Media executives fear such oversight could lead to censorship of content seen as critical of the government, and three digital news outlets have approached state courts.
""These...rules will signify the death of media independence in India,"" said Siddharth Varadarajan, editor of independent news website 'The Wire'. Its publisher has challenged the regulation in the Delhi High Court.
LiveLaw, a legal news website, has challenged the rules in the Kerala High Court, which this week said no coercive action should be taken against the website for non-compliance.
The government says the new rules are aimed at achieving parity between digital media and print and TV news regulations. Referring to the rules for digital media, information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar last month said ""every freedom has to be responsible freedom"".
The number of online media outlets in India has increased in recent years, but some journalists have complained they face intimidation for reporting stories critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his administration. 
Modi's administration says it favours press freedom. (https://reut.rs/3tcKuml)
""I think these rules will restrict and constrain press freedom, as indeed freedom more generally,"" said Zoya Hasan, a former professor of political science at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.
""This whole regulation is about control of digital media and other platforms as there's little tolerance for dissenting voices.""
U.S. think tank Freedom House recently said Modi and his party are driving India toward ""authoritarianism"", adding political rights and civil liberties had deteriorated since he came to power in 2014. The government called the report ""misleading, incorrect and misplaced"".
On Thursday, Javadekar said on Twitter that a group representing leading newspapers and TV channels had welcomed the new regulation and asked that their members ""be treated differently"" from digital-only news publishers. 

That has drawn criticism from some smaller digital news outlets, which have questioned why they are being ignored while seeking exemptions.

759,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 08:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Airbus targets Boeing's freight fortress with potential A350 cargo jet - sources,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is canvassing airline support for a potential freighter version of its A350 passenger jet, targeting a key stronghold of U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) as e-commerce lifts demand for transported goods, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The jet would be the first freighter spin-off of the latest generation of carbon-fibre jets and help stabilise output of wide-body jets that have been badly hit by the COVID-19 crisis.
But a launch depends on identifying enough buyers willing to take a punt on fickle cargo demand in the midst of the aviation industry's worst downturn, which has trampled airline finances.
""We are always looking at product developments but do not comment on specific programmes,"" an Airbus spokesman said.
Air freight demand, which was weak before the COVID-19 crisis, has soared as home-bound shoppers turn to e-commerce, but analysts warn it is volatile and prone to extended downturns.
Normally about half the world's air cargo is carried in the bellies of passenger jets, but a hit to travel from the pandemic has left the world more reliant on dedicated freighters and conversions of passenger planes.
Although it has vaulted past Boeing as the world's largest producer of passenger jets, Airbus has had limited success in penetrating the freighter fortress of its arch-rival.
It pulled the plug on a freighter version of its A380 superjumbo almost 15 years ago and has had no freighters in its order pipeline since December, when Turkey's MNG Airlines cancelled three A330 freighter. 
Boeing has delivered 202 of the rival 777 freighter, compared with 38 of the A330 cargo version. Dominating the trade lanes is Boeing's 747 freighter with more than 260 delivered. 
'BRIGHT SPOT'
It is not the first time a possible new freighter has been mooted. The latest design on the drawing board at Airbus's Toulouse headquarters in France involves a slightly longer aircraft than the best-selling Airbus A350-900 jetliner.
Its development poses technical challenges since it would involve placing a cargo door in the composite shell chosen by Airbus to compete with Boeing's lightweight composite 787.
Experts say cutting composite is more challenging than traditional aluminium, though Airbus could reap benefits from a decision - seen as costly at the time - to build the A350 from composite panels rather than barrel sections used on the 787.
Industry sources estimate Airbus would need commitments for some 50 aircraft to go ahead with a launch, with Chief Executive Guillaume Faury focusing on carrying out a major restructuring while directing resources towards an A321XLR passenger plane.
A development would cost an estimated $2-3 billion.
Temptingly, the booming freight market offers respite from a slump in demand for big jets that has forced Airbus and Boeing to slash production, with A350 output halving to five a month.
More than a third of wide-body jets sold by Boeing in the past year have been freighters.
But the same crisis that crippled passenger travel has also created a glut of unused passenger planes that can be converted more cheaply into freighters than buying new. That means the business case for developing a new aircraft must be watertight.
""Given the A350 production rate has been cut ... and the cargo market is the one bright spot in the wide-body market, one would have to say the likelihood of an A350F has increased compared to a year ago,"" said Richard Evans, senior consultant at UK-based Ascend by Cirium.

While not imminent, a launch could jog Boeing into reacting with a freighter version of its larger 777X, he added, though Boeing must also grapple with delays in its certification.

In a statement read out by Poland to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, they said that actions by Russian authorities against the opposition leader were ""unacceptable and politically motivated"". The 45 countries were mainly European but also included Australia, Canada and Japan.
Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, was jailed for two and a half years last month over alleged parole violations related to an embezzlement case he said was trumped up for political reasons, something the authorities deny. 
""We call on the Russian Federation for the immediate and unconditional release of Mr Navalny and of all those unlawfully or arbitrarily detained, including for exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, freedom of opinion and expression, and freedom of religion or belief,"" the joint statement said.
""We are also concerned by the large number of arbitrary arrests of protesters who were expressing their support for Mr Navalny in many Russian cities,"" the statement added.
Russia has previously described such criticism as interference in its internal affairs.
Britain's ambassador, Julian Braithwaite, said it was ""disgraceful"" that Navalny, who was poisoned last year with what Western countries say was a military-grade nerve agent, had been jailed while the poisoning was not investigated.
On Friday, Navalny's lawyers said he had been moved from a jail in Russia's Vladimir region and his whereabouts were unknown.
U.N. human rights experts said on March 1 that Russia was to blame for the attempt to kill Navalny, and called for an international investigation into his poisoning. Moscow denies poisoning Navalny and says it has seen no evidence.
""Today’s statement should be just the start of greater Council scrutiny and action to end the crackdown,"" John Fisher of New York-based Human Rights Watch said.

The United States and European Union have imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and entities over the Navalny case. The Kremlin called the moves absurd, unjustified and void of any real impact.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Western countries on Friday called on Egypt to end the prosecution of activists, journalists and perceived political opponents under counter-terrorism laws, and to unconditionally release them.
The United States, which has observer status at the U.N. Human Rights Council, was among 31 signatories of the joint statement on Egypt, the first since 2014, which called on the government to lift curbs on freedoms of expression and assembly.
Egypt is a close ally of the United States, but the Biden administration has vowed to speak out about human rights violations and abuses of the rule of law worldwide. 
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who ousted the Muslim Brotherhood from power in 2013, has overseen an extensive crackdown on political dissent that has steadily tightened in recent years. Sisi has said there are no political prisoners in Egypt and that stability and security are paramount. 
""We urge Egypt to guarantee space for civil society – including human rights defenders – to work without fear of intimidation, harassment, arrest, detention or any other form of reprisal,"" Finland's ambassador Kirsti Kauppi said, reading out the statement to the Geneva forum. 
""That includes lifting travel bans and asset freezes against human rights defenders – including EIPR staff,"" she said, referring to three activists from the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights arrested last November after briefing senior diplomats in Cairo.
Egypt's foreign ministry had said EIPR was operating illegally, an accusation the group denies. 
The trio have been provisionally released, but the arrests galvanised support for the move in the council, activists and diplomats said. 
“It’s been seven years since there has been any kind of collective action on Egypt at the Human Rights Council, all the while the situation has declined sharply - this is a crucial step,"" Kevin Whelan, Amnesty International representative to the UN in Geneva, told Reuters.
“We’re at the point where the survival of the human rights movement in Egypt is at stake.”

Most of the signatory countries are European, joined by Australia, Canada and New Zealand. No countries from the African or Middle East region backed the statement.

Any thaw in ties between the two regional powerhouses could have repercussions around the Middle East, where Cairo and Ankara have sought to influence events in various hotspots and stand on opposing sides in a Mediterranean maritime dispute. 
Two Egyptian intelligence sources said Turkey had proposed a meeting to discuss cooperation, but suggested the contacts were still only preliminary.
President Tayyip Erdogan said the contacts were ""not at the highest level, but right below the highest level. We hope that we can continue this process with Egypt much more strongly.""
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was quoted as saying by state-owned Anadolu news agency: ""We have contacts with Egypt both on the intelligence level and the foreign ministry level ... Contacts at the diplomatic level have started.""
Relations with Cairo have been frosty since Egypt's army ousted Mohammed Mursi, Egypt's first democratically elected president and an ally of Erdogan, after protests in 2013. 
An Egyptian security official received a phone call from a Turkish intelligence official on Thursday, setting out Turkey’s desire for a meeting in Cairo to discuss economic, political and diplomatic cooperation, the Egyptian intelligence sources said.
The Egyptian official welcomed the call and promised to respond as soon as possible, the Egyptian sources said.
The call followed unofficial contacts between Egyptian and Turkish security officials in which communications between the two sides were discussed. The issue of maritime borders, a source of tension between Turkey and other east Mediterranean countries, was not raised, according to the sources.
Rebuilding trust will be hard. As well as the tensions over the ousting of Mursi and Mediterranean disputes, Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said last week the Arab League expressed its ""categorical rejection"" of Turkish military interventions in Syria, Iraq and Libya.
GULF STATES
Cavusoglu's comments come as Turkey seeks to repair strained relations with several regional powers. He said on Friday Ankara would reciprocate if Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates take ""positive steps"" to overcome recent tensions.
Ties with Riyadh have been strained over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 and a row between Turkey's ally Qatar and other Gulf Arab states. Trade has collapsed under an informal boycott by Saudi businesses.
Turkey has also been at odds with the United Arab Emirates over the conflict in Libya, and both countries have accused each other of disrupting regional stability.
""There is no reason for our ties with Saudi Arabia not to be fixed. If they take positive steps, we will take positive steps. The same goes for the UAE. We don't want to fight with anyone,"" Cavusoglu said. 
Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by Saudi operatives in 2018 and a U.S. intelligence report found Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the operation.

""We never blamed the Saudi Arabian leadership,"" Cavusoglu said. At the time, Erdogan said the operation was ordered at the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government. Erdogan spoke to King Salman in November and they agreed to resolve differences through dialogue, Turkey's presidency said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - About 3,000 police will be deployed to enforce a week-long curfew and lockdown in the central Indian city of Nagpur from Monday after a 60% jump in coronavirus cases there, officials said.
The commercial and logistics hub in Maharashtra state will be the first Indian city to go back into a wholesale lockdown since authorities lifted nationwide curbs in June last year.
Officers will be watching traffic to stop unnecessary journeys and checking that most offices and shops, apart from groceries and pharmacies, stay closed, Nagpur police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said.
""It's a curfew except for the essential services. Hospital and medical shops will be functioning and people going for vaccination will be facilitated,"" he told Reuters.
The medical superintendent at Nagpur's Government Medical College & Hospital said infections in the city had risen 60% over the last two weeks to around 13,000, among the highest in Maharashtra.
""There is an increase in social gatherings, and people not following norms related to sanitisation, masks and physical distancing,"" Avinash V. Gawande added.
India's overall case load has climbed to 11.3 million, second only to the United States.
A total of 23,285 new coronavirus cases were reported across the country in the last 24 hours, the health ministry said on Friday - the highest daily rise since Dec. 24, according to a Reuters tally.
Deaths rose by 117 to reach 158,306. Fatalities have been rising by a daily average of roughly 100 since early February.
The government has been driving a nationwide immunisation campaign aiming to vaccinate a fifth of the country's 1.3 billion people by August.
Maharashtra, which also includes the financial capital Mumbai, has around 2.27 million cases - the highest of any state in India.

Medics say there has also been a steady rise in cases in the capital New Delhi over the past two weeks, likely due to increased travel and slackened hygiene measures.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, who saw himself as the custodian of his people's culture and was praised by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa as a ""visionary monarch"", died on Friday. 
Zwelithini, who was 72, died in hospital, the royal family said. He had been admitted to hospital in KwaZulu-Natal province last month to be treated for diabetes.
Though his role was largely ceremonial, Zwelithini was revered by his people and had vast influence over millions of Zulus.
Ramaphosa hailed his contribution to national unity and economic development in KwaZulu-Natal and South Africa as a whole, and the opposition Democratic Alliance party called Zwelithini ""a hugely important and influential figure on our political and cultural landscape for the past five decades"". 
""Tragically, while still in hospital, His Majesty's health took a turn for the worse and he subsequently passed away in the early hours of this morning,"" a statement issued by Prince Mangosutho Buthelezi, founder of the Inkatha Freedom Party and traditional prime minister to the Zulu monarch, said.
""On behalf of the Royal Family, we thank the nation for your continued prayers and support in this most difficult time."" 
Zwelithini was officially crowned the eighth monarch of South Africa's largest ethnic group in 1971, after going into hiding fearing assassination when his father died in 1968. 
In 1984, he revived the reed dance, a 19th century practice which sees thousands of bare-breasted maidens dance in front of the king to celebrate their beauty and virginity in the KwaZulu-Natal province.
Facing criticism, Zwelithini defended his decision by saying it helped stem pre-marital sex and the spread of AIDS.
""I feel like it's not just a loss for the Zulu nation, but the loss of culture in itself,"" Johannesburg resident Noni Casmiro told Reuters.
'GUIDE THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES'
Another resident, Lazarus Aphane, said Zwelithini had helped guide his people ""through difficult times during apartheid.""
Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu was born on July 14, 1948, the year the National Party came to power and began its programme of racial segregation and domination.
In 2018, he waded into South Africa's contentious land debate, warning the governing African National Congress not to include territory under his control in a land reform drive which mostly targeted white-owned property.
The lands he controlled under an entity called the Ingonyama Trust - 3 million hectares (7,413,161 acres) - comprised the ""Zulu homeland"" in KwaZulu-Natal, one of several ethnically-based regions where most black South Africans were confined under apartheid.
Across South Africa, tribal authorities say they are custodians of land that was communal before European colonialism, and they often control access to resources on such lands, including negotiating deals with mining companies.

The king also courted controversy in 2015, when several people were killed in anti-immigrant violence following xenophobic remarks Zwelithini made. He later called the attacks ""vile"".

A lawmaker from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc on Thursday became the third within a week to resign from her parliamentary group over the scandal, which risks costing the Christian Democrats in Sunday's twin state votes.
Anger about the scandal is compounding frustration among Germans with Merkel's conservative-led coalition over a sluggish coronavirus vaccine rollout caused by supply shortages and leaden bureaucracy.
Steinmeier, a member of the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD), acknowledged in a rare intervention into domestic politics that Germans were tired of living under lockdown.
""...And then have to hear that MPs, of all people, are holding out their hand before the modest medical protection of face masks even reaches the people...That is shabby and shameful!"" he told a conference hosted by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.
In the past week, the CDU's Nikolas Loebel has given up his seat and Bavarian conservative Georg Nuesslein stepped down from the parliamentary party. Both had been accused of receiving payments for brokering face mask procurement deals. 
Mark Hauptmann from the eastern state of Thuringia told the CDU he would give up his seat in parliament, his office confirmed on Thursday, after allegations that he helped contacts in Azerbaijan with procurement.
The scandal is embarrassing for the CDU, which has seen its support slip in the states of Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate where elections on Sunday will be a crucial gauge of popular feeling before a September federal election.
A March 10 poll, from Forsa, put the conservative bloc on 33%, down from 40% in June when Merkel won plaudits for her management of the coronavirus crisis in its first phase. She will not seek a fifth term as chancellor in September.

Another survey on Friday showed support for the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, slumping 4 points within a month to 41.6%.

Texas announced the lifting of that restriction - which had made mask wearing compulsory in public buildings and many outdoor spaces to help contain the coronavirus - on Wednesday, along with an end to occupancy curbs on businesses.
But the city council in Austin, the state capital, voted to still require masks to be worn.
""I told Travis County & The City of Austin to comply with state mask law. They blew me off. So, once again, I'm dragging them to court"", Attorney General Ken Paxton said on Twitter.
Austin is located in Travis County.
Several major retailers, grocery and restaurant chains in Texas have said they would still require masks to be worn in their stores.
That was their right, Paxton said in a letter dated March 10 to Austin Mayor Steve Adler and Travis County Judge Andy Brown.
However, such a decision ""does not rest with jurisdictions like the City of Austin or Travis County,"" he added.
Adler told MSNBC in an interview on Thursday: ""We think that masking is so important. Now is not the time to take a risk. We are not far enough along yet. We are still battling this virus.""
The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus pandemic is above 500,000, the highest of any single country. Around 20% of the population have received at least one dose of vaccine.

Texas was one of the first U.S. states to reopen its economy after the first wave of the pandemic last May.

Some of those migrants not in the program have been waiting along the U.S.-Mexico border longer than those who were enrolled in MPP after they were caught crossing the border illegally. Now, migrants with active MPP cases are eligible to claim asylum in the United States. The exact number of non-MPP asylum seekers along the border is not clear because there is no single record of them, but advocates say there could be thousands.
The president's focus on MPP is not surprising - it was one of Trump's most controversial immigration policies, and Biden denounced it on the campaign trail.
Trump said the program aimed to curb the release of thousands of migrants who had entered the United States to claim asylum. But migrant groups said many of those people were forced to live in squalor in Mexico and were vulnerable to violence, including kidnappings and extortion.
In the rush to get rid of the program, attorneys and activists say one unintended effect is that non-MPP asylum seekers who have spent months and even years at the border have been left in limbo. Advocates are now pressing the U.S. government to allow these asylum seekers entry into the United States to make their claims.
The issue highlights the challenges facing the Biden administration as it seeks to reform immigration policies, while also emphasizing that not everyone who comes to the border will be granted asylum.
Republicans and critics have coalesced around the message that Biden has implemented an open-border policy. Biden officials, however, are discouraging migrants from making their way to the United States, stating that the majority of people who arrive will be turned away.
The White House referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security, which said in a statement that the ""system to process individuals with active MPP cases is the first phase of a program to restore safe and orderly processing at the southwest border.""
It declined to elaborate on when or if asylum seekers without active MPP cases would be allowed to claim asylum in the United States. 
'THE LIST'
Angeles, a Nicaraguan mother of two who asked that Reuters use her middle name for her safety, is one of the asylum seekers not in MPP.
She has been waiting with her family in the Mexican city of Tijuana for 15 months after fleeing her country for political persecution.
Afraid of kidnappings, the family rarely goes outside their home and struggles to buy basic necessities like food. Her husband works as a mechanic in exchange for a room for his family. Angeles' children, aged 15 and 7, are not in school, and her eldest son is sleeping poorly.
Despite her family's difficult situation, Angeles says she wants to enter the United States legally. In November 2019, she added her family to ""La Lista,"" - The List - an informal, handwritten book maintained by migrants on the Mexican side of the border. Administrators recorded the names of thousands of migrants and gave them numbers as they waited their turn to make asylum claims to U.S. officials. 
She and her family got two numbers - 4,465 and 4,466 - on two scraps of paper. For more than a year, that has been their only clue about when they could enter the country.
La Lista was borne out of another policy embraced by Trump called ""metering,"" which limited how many migrants could seek asylum each day at U.S. ports of entry. The Strauss Center, a University of Texas research organization, estimates that 9,600 people were on La Lista in Tijuana alone up until it closed in March 2020, though it is not clear how many of those people are still at the border.
But Angeles' family never got called. After the COVID-19 outbreak, the United States sealed the southern border to the vast majority of asylum seekers. Angeles doesn't know whether her family's numbers mean anything anymore. 
""I just want an answer, for them to tell me, 'Look, come present yourself on this day,' even if they interviewed me and gave me a number and told me to come back,"" Angeles said. ""But I have nothing.""
""There's basically almost no access to asylum for people who are not in the MPP program,"" said Ginger Cline, a lawyer who represents migrants in Tijuana with Al Otro Lado, an immigration nonprofit group. ""It's an issue because there are now thousands of people who are waiting in dangerous border cities who don't have access to basic needs.""
BLACK MIGRANTS FACE UNCERTAINTY
Tijuana also has a large population of Haitian migrants as well as migrants who traveled from Africa. They are particularly vulnerable to extortion and racism, migrants and advocates say. They, too, have been left in limbo as MPP was mostly limited to Spanish-speaking asylum seekers.
""The situation is really difficult for those of African descent,"" said Katerine Giron, an organizer with Espacio Migrante, a migrant community organization in Tijuana. 
The Biden administration ""has not done anything for Black immigrants except continuing the cruel and inhumane system that existed before Trump but heightened under Trump,"" said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, an activist group which provides humanitarian assistance to migrants along the border and in the United States.
The group estimates there are about 5,000 Black immigrants in Tijuana, and 10,000-15,000 border-wide.
The White House and DHS did not respond to questions about how its approach to unwinding MPP is affecting Black migrants.
In the absence of clarity from the U.S. government, hundreds of asylum seekers have begun camping near the port of entry in Tijuana, hoping to make their asylum claims. 
The camp has swelled to about 1,500 people since mid-February, said Alex Mensing, a Tijuana-based immigration advocate with Innovation Law Lab who is part of a coalition that has been trying to help migrants coming to the port of entry.
The expansion of the camp comes as U.S. officials have declared that the swift processing of MPP claimants has allowed Mexico to close the sprawling Matamoros camp on the border that was the most visible symbol of Trump's crackdown on migration from Central America. 
Mensing's group had counted 241 tents at the port as of Tuesday. Many people camping out do not have active MPP cases but have spent more than a year at the border. 

""There’s almost universally this idea that it doesn't make sense to let some asylum seekers in and not others,"" Mensing said. ""They do not see that as fair.""

768,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>",Twenty-one Hong Kong activists remain in custody after court rejects bail appeals,"By Jessie Pang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Twenty-one Hong Kong activists will remain in custody after a court on Friday rejected requests by some for bail and others withdrew their applications in a widely monitored case where they are charged with conspiracy to subvert the government.
The charges against a total of 47 opposition figures represent the most sweeping use yet of Hong Kong's new security law, which punishes what it broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
The case offers an insight into how the mainland-style justice drafted by Beijing into the security law clashes with the global financial hub's common-law traditions, and is being closely watched by foreign diplomats and rights groups. 
In contrast with past practice, the new security law puts the onus on defendants to prove they will not pose a security threat if released on bail.
Since the group of 47 were charged around two weeks ago, the court has heard a series of requests for bail. While most requests were rejected, the court approved some applications, prompting immediate appeals from prosecutors to overturn some of those approvals. Just five of the group are currently out on bail. 
Of the 21 defendants in court on Friday, Judge Victor So rejected 11 applications while the rest were withdrawn by the defendants. The rejected defendants have the right to file for another review in eight days, although most indicated they did not intend to do so.
The 47 activists are accused of organising and participating in an unofficial, non-binding primary poll in July 2020 that authorities said was part of a ""vicious plot"" to ""overthrow"" the government.
The vote was aimed at selecting the strongest opposition candidates for a legislative council election that the government later postponed, citing the coronavirus.
The detentions have been fiercely criticised by governments in the West, including Britain and the United States.
Hong Kong's Department of Justice has said no one should interfere with independent prosecutorial decisions. 
Supporters of the new law say it has restored stability after months of pro-democracy protests in 2019.
Hong Kong laws restrict media coverage of the content of bail hearings. The next hearing in the case is on May 31.

More than 70 people have been killed and about 2,000 arrested in a crackdown on protests since Myanmar's military took power in a coup on Feb. 1, advocacy body the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners says.
The six journalists, all arrested on Feb. 27, were not brought to court but attended the hearing via teleconference from prison. They have not been allowed to see their families or lawyers in person since the arrest.
Lawyer Tin Zar Oo said the case of her client, Thein Zaw of the Associated Press, and four others, would next be heard on March 24.
""He seems OK, but he said he has asthma, so he is a bit uncomfortable,"" she said, speaking of Thein Zaw. ""His family members got to talk to him.""
Another court extended detention until March 25 for a sixth journalist, from Myanmar Now, the group's editor-in-chief, Swe Win, said.
Court officials did not comment.
The U.S. state department has voiced concern at the arrests and urged the immediate release of the journalists.
Authorities in Myanmar have raided the offices of four independent news organisations during the last few days. The government has also stripped the licences of five organisations that have been active in covering the protests.
At least 35 journalists have been arrested since the Feb. 1 coup, Myanmar Now reported, of whom 19 have been released.
A junta spokesman told a news conference on Thursday that the military respected and valued press freedom but that the arrested journalists were provoking unrest.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) cut its supply forecast of COVID-19 vaccine to the European Union in the first quarter to about 30 million doses, a third of its contractual obligations and a 25% drop from pledges made last month, a document seen by Reuters shows.
The shortfall is a further blow to EU's vaccination plans already being hampered by repeated delays in supply and a slow rollout in some nations. 
The AstraZeneca document, shared with EU officials and dated March 10, shows that the company now expects to deliver 30.1 million doses by the end of March, and another 20 million in April.
On Feb. 25, AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot told the European Parliament that the company would try to deliver 40 million doses by the end of March.
The document shows that on Feb. 24, the Anglo-Swedish company had estimated a supply of only 34 million doses to the EU for the January to March period, well below its contracted target of 90 million doses.
The new cut follows a decision last week by Italy and the European Commission to block a shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines from Italy to Australia, in the first application of an EU mechanism that allows the bloc to refuse export requests from vaccine makers that do not comply with EU supply contracts.
A spokesman for AstraZeneca declined to comment on Friday.
A person familiar with the situation said that the increased deliveries the company had expected for the first quarter did not materialise because of difficulties in moving vaccines through global supply chains.
The United States, from where AstraZeneca expected to partly supply the EU market, told the EU that it would not export AstraZeneca shots in the near future, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing EU officials.
The company had said its initial supply cuts were caused by production problems in the EU.
'NOT  BEST  (NYSE:BEST) EFFORTS'
""I see efforts, but not ""best efforts"". That's not good enough yet for AstraZeneca to meet its Q1 obligations,"" EU industry commissioner Thierry Breton said on Twitter late on Thursday.
""It's time for AstraZeneca's Board to exercise its fiduciary responsibility and now do what it takes to fulfil AZ's commitments,"" Breton added.
AstraZeneca has committed to making its ""best reasonable efforts"" to meet the targets set in its contract with the EU, which foresees delivery of 300 million doses from December to the end of June. The vaccine was approved for use in the EU in late January. 
The AstraZeneca document also shows that the company expects to deliver about 20 million doses to the EU in April, more than half of that in the last week. It includes no forecasts for May or June.
AstraZeneca has committed to supplying the 27-nation bloc with 180 million doses between April and June. 
But EU countries since February have updated their vaccination plans to include only half of the contracted doses after AstraZeneca told them it was facing difficulties.
Germany, the largest country in the bloc, is expected to receive 19% of the AstraZeneca supplies to the EU between next week and the end of April, or a total of about 6 million doses, including over 2 million in the last week of the month, the document shows.

France should receive nearly 15% of the total, or about 4.7 million shots. Italy, with almost 14% of the overall expected supplies, is to get 4.4 million by the end of April, the document shows.

Cavusoglu's comments come after the United States shared a draft peace plan calling for replacing Afghanistan's government with a power-sharing interim administration pending elections under a new constitution.
The U.S. proposal is intended to jump-start stalled talks in Doha between the Taliban and a team including Afghan officials on a political settlement to decades of conflict.
Cavusoglu said Turkey had previously been asked by Afghan officials, the Taliban and the negotiation team to host talks, and this week's decision came after a U.S. proposal for Turkey to host a meeting.
""This is not a meeting that is an alternative to the Qatar process, it is a complement to that,"" state-owned Anadolu news agency quoted Cavusoglu as saying. We will carry this out in coordination with brotherly Qatar, but it will be in Turkey.""
He said the aim was for talks between the Taliban and the government to continue in a ""goal-oriented"" way. The exact date in April, and the content of the talks, were being discussed.
Cavusoglu also said Turkey had been sending messages to the Taliban and the negotiating team, calling for violence in the country to stop for talks to yield results.
The Taliban and the Afghan government have been negotiating in Qatar to reach a peace deal. Those talks resumed in January after an almost month-long break, but negotiators and diplomats say there has been little progress since then.

Russia also plans to hold a conference on Afghanistan in Moscow later this month, the TASS news agency said on Tuesday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - For one minute this week, workers at the Fukushima nuclear station fell silent to mark the 10-year anniversary of a natural disaster that triggered the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl.
Then they went back to work tearing down the reactors melted down in the days after a tsunami on March 11, 2011.
The job ranks as the most expensive and dangerous nuclear clean-up ever attempted. A decade in, an army of engineers, scientists and 5,000 workers are still mapping out a project many expect will not be completed in their lifetime. 
Naoaki Okuzumi, the head of research at Japan's lead research institute on decommissioning, compares the work ahead to climbing a mountain range - without a map.
""The feeling we have is, you think the summit's right there, but then you reach it and can see another summit, further beyond,"" Okuzumi told Reuters.
Okuzumi and others need to find a way to remove and safely store 880 tonnes of highly radioactive uranium fuel along with a larger mass of concrete and metal into which fuel melted a decade ago during the accident. 
The robotic tools to do the job don't yet exist. There is no plan for where to put the radioactive material when it is removed. 
Japan's government says the job could run 40 years. Outside experts say it could take twice as long, pushing completion near the close of the century. 
GRAPHIC: Fukushima's recovery from disaster https://graphics.reuters.com/JAPAN-DISASTER-NUCLEAR-ICEWALL/01006144292/JAPAN-DISASTER.jpg
Tepco's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, which once had six reactors, was plunged into crisis by the tsunami that followed a magnitude 9.0 quake off the shore of northern Japan on March 11, 2011. 
The quake and tsunami flooded the back-up power generators at Fukushima, knocking out cooling systems. The reactors quickly overheated, setting off explosions as uranium cores melted down. The radioactive plumes that formed forced the evacuation of about 160,000 people.
It wasn't until 2017 that engineers understood how complicated the clean-up would become. By that point, five specially designed robots had been dispatched through the dark, contaminated waters pumped in to cool the uranium. But radiation zapped their electronics.
One robot developed by Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp, nicknamed the ""little sunfish"", a device about the size of a loaf of bread, provided an early glimpse of the chaotic damage around the cores.
Kenji Matsuzaki, a robot technician at Toshiba who led development of the ""sunfish"", had assumed that they would find melted fuel at the bottom of the reactors. 
But the sunfish's first video images showed a tumult of destruction, with overturned structures inside the reactor, clumps of unrecognizable brown debris and dangerously radioactive metal.
""I expected it to be broken, but I didn't expect it would be this bad,"" Matsuzaki said.
The delivery of a robotic arm to start removing fuel, developed in a $16 million programme with the UK's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, has been delayed until 2022. Tepco plans to use it to grab some debris from inside reactor 2 for testing and to help plan the main operation.
The project has had some successes. About 2,000 spent fuel rods in reactors No. 3 and No. 4 - which could have caused another massive radiological release if they overheated - have been removed after giant frames and cranes were erected over the buildings.
Radiation has been reduced in most of the Fukushima work site, about the size of New York's Central Park. In most areas of the plant, the 5,000 workers no longer need special protective equipment that had slowed work during Japan's hot, humid summers.
GRAPHIC: Japan earthquake and tsunami https://graphics.reuters.com/JAPAN-FUKUSHIMA/ANNIVERSARY/gjnvwzmqjpw/JAPAN-EARTHQUAKE-ANNIVERSARY.jpg
But the cleanup has been delayed by the buildup of contaminated water in tanks that crowd the site. The melted cores are kept cool by pumping water into damaged reactor vessels. 
The water is pumped out and treated. Storage tanks now hold enough radioactive water to fill more than 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Tepco expects it will max out its storage space next year.
Most analysts expect the government to release the water into the ocean after further treatment. Fishing communities have lobbied against that and South Korea and China have objected to such a move.
There still is no plan for where to put the radioactive debris from the reactors.

""It's no good just moving highly radioactive waste from inside the nuclear reactor to somewhere else in the plant,"" said Hiroshi Miyano, the head of the decommissioning committee of the Atomic Energy Society of Japan. ""Where will the waste go? Will it be pulverized? These are the questions that need to be asked.""

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Six miners have been killed in a blast at a coal mine in southwestern Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan, officials with the provincial Directorate of Mines told Reuters. 
They were among eight miners trapped about 1,000 feet underground when accumulating methane gas exploded at the coal field in Marwar in the province of Balochistan, the officials said.
“Six bodies have been retrieved by the rescue team from the affected mine this morning,” a senior official of the Directorate of Mines said. 
""(The) mine has been closed and an inquiry has been ordered by the Chief Inspector of Mines into the incident.""
In the past year, 102 coal miners have been killed in Balochistan in 72 different incidents, Sultan Muhammad Lala, president of the Balochistan Coal Mines Workers Federation, told Reuters. 
Lala said the government and mine owners were not ensuring safe working conditions at the sites.
An explosion caused by methane gas at another coal mine in Marwar in May 2018 killed 20 workers. In August that year, another methane-fueled explosion in the city of Quetta killed seven. 
In 2011, 45 coal miners were killed by a methane gas explosion, also in Balochistan.
Sparsely populated and impoverished Balochistan is home to large deposits of coal, natural gas, copper and gold, many of which are being extracted by Chinese-backed operations. Separatist militants often target workers and security forces.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's first videoconference with European Union foreign ministers last month was so good humoured that some diplomats in Europe described it as a ""love fest"".
But two senior envoys who attended said there was no direct response from the ministers gathered in Brussels when Blinken said: ""We must push back on China together and show strength in unity."" 
Their reticence is partly due to an unwillingness to commit to anything until Washington spells out more fully its China policy under President Joe Biden.
But the ministers were also cautious because the EU is looking for a strategic balance in relations with Beijing and Washington that ensures the bloc is not so closely allied with one of the world's two big powers that it alienates the other. 
The EU also hopes to have enough independence from Washington and Beijing to be able on its own to deepen ties with countries in the Indo-Pacific region such as India, Japan and Australia, EU officials said.
In a new departure for the EU, they said, the bloc hopes to agree a plan next month that involves a larger and more assertive security presence in the Indo-Pacific, and more development aid, trade and diplomacy. 
""We are charting a third way between Washington and Beijing,"" an EU envoy in Asia said.
Another EU official in Asia expressed concern that the United States had ""a hawkish agenda against China, which is not our agenda"". 
'EUROPE ROADSHOW'
Last month's videoconference was part of an attempt under Biden to rebuild alliances neglected by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who had an antagonistic relationship with both the EU and China.
The White House has embarked on a ""Europe roadshow"", a senior U.S. official said, and is in daily contact with European governments about China's rising power, in ""a sustained effort for ... a high degree of coordination and cooperation in a number of areas."" 
In a sign that the U.S. push on China is having an impact, Germany plans to send a frigate in August to Asia and across the South China Sea, where Beijing has military outposts on artificial islands, senior government officials told Reuters.
The EU is also set to sanction four Chinese officials and one entity - with travel bans and asset freezes - on March 22 over human rights abuses in China's Uighur Muslim minority, diplomats said.
In a further sign, when Chinese President Xi Jinping chaired a video summit with central and eastern European countries last month, six EU member states - Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovenia - sent ministers rather than heads of state.
But there is still distrust in Brussels of Washington's approach to China, even if attitudes in Europe have hardened against China over Beijing's crackdown in Hong Kong, treatment of Uighur Muslims and the COVID-19 pandemic, first identified in China.
The United States says China is an authoritarian country that has embarked on a military modernisation that threatens the West, and has sought to weaken telecommunications equipment maker Huawei, which it sees as a national security threat.
The U.S.-led NATO military alliance is also beginning to focus on China, but Biden's administration is still reviewing policy.
""We ask what their China strategy is and they say they still don't have one,"" the EU official in Asia said. 
French President Emmanuel Macron highlighted concerns in some EU states last month by saying that uniting against China would create ""the highest possible"" potential for conflict. 
'NO ALTERNATIVE'
But the EU is hungry for new trade and sees the Indo-Pacific as offering huge potential.
The EU has a trade deal with Japan and is negotiating one with Australia. Diplomats say countries in the Indo-Pacific want the EU to be more active in the region to keep trade free and open, and to ensure they are not left facing a straight choice between Beijing and Washington.
France committed to closer ties with allies such as Australia and India with an Indo-Pacific strategy in 2018, followed by the Netherlands, which also has its own strategy, and Germany's looser set of ""guidelines"".
The EU strategy, if agreed, could involve putting more EU military experts in EU diplomatic missions in Asia, training coast guards and sending more EU military personnel to serve on Australian ships patrolling in the Indian Ocean, diplomats said.
It is unclear how much Germany, which has close business ties to China, will commit to any new strategy. German government officials say the EU cannot afford to alienate Beijing despite labelling China a ""systemic rival"" in 2019.
But French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian will travel to India in April to develop the EU's Indo-Pacific strategy, and the EU aims to hold a summit with India this year.
France, which has 1.8 million citizens in Pacific overseas territories, has about 4,000 troops in the region, plus navy ships and patrol boats. 

""The Indo-Pacific is the cornerstone of Europe's geopolitical path,"" said a French diplomat. ""There's no alternative.""

Magufuli, 61, who is Africa's most prominent coronavirus sceptic, has not been seen in public since Feb. 27.
Tanzanian opposition leader Tundu Lissu has cited medical and security sources for information that the president was flown to the private Nairobi Hospital in neighbouring Kenya and then on to India in a coma.
But the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation quoted Tanzania's ambassador in Windhoek, Modestus Kipilimba, as saying Magufuli was in good health and remained in Tanzania. 
""High Commissioner Kipilimba dismissed the reports, saying Magufuli is in Tanzania going about his normal duties,"" NBC said, in what would be the first public comments from a Tanzanian official about Magufuli's situation since questions were raised.
Kenya's Nation newspaper cited unidentified political and diplomatic sources earlier this week saying that an African leader, which it did not name, was being treated for COVID-19 on a ventilator at the private Nairobi Hospital. [L1N2L80WJ] 
The hospital has said nothing. 
In power since 2015 and nicknamed ""The Bulldozer"", Magufuli has played down the threat from COVID-19, saying God and remedies such as steam inhalation would protect Tanzanians. 
He has mocked coronavirus tests, denounced vaccines as part of a Western conspiracy to take Africa's wealth, and opposed mask-wearing and social distancing. 
Tanzania stopped reporting coronavirus data in May last year when it said it had 509 cases and 21 deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which has urged Magufuli's government to be more transparent and to implement COVID-19 curbs.

Magufuli, a former chemistry professor from the village of Chato in northwest Tanzania, was first elected president in 2015. He has faced accusations from Western countries and opposition parties of eroding democracy, which he denies.

(Reuters) - Central African Republic will vote in a second round of parliamentary elections on Sunday under high security after a surge in rebel violence surrounding December's polls. 
Insurgents laid siege to the capital Bangui in January, strangling food supply routes, forcing more than 200,000 from their homes, and raising concerns that the country was slipping back into the kind of sectarian conflict that has killed thousands over the past decade. 
President Faustin Archange Touadéra won re-election but rebels, who the United Nations say are backed by former president François Bozizé, sought to take control amid allegations of voting irregularities.
Sunday's polls concern leglislative elections, including run-off votes in 49 electoral districts and first round voting in 69 districts where violence stopped the vote from taking place in December.
The country's army, backed by Russian and Rwandan forces, and aided by U.N. peacekeepers, have steadily retaken a number of rebel strongholds since their initial offensive. 
""We have a much stronger defense and security forces presence on the ground to help secure the elections,"" said Abdoul-Aziz Fall, spokesman for the country's U.N. peacekeeping mission, know as MINUSCA.
Government officials are optimistic that the vote will be peaceful, pointing to military victories and the unblocking of a 580-km (360-mile) corridor that brings much needed supplies from Cameroon to Bangui. 
The situation is far from stable in the gold- and diamond-rich nation of 4.7 million people that has seen repeated bouts of violence since Bozizé's ouster in 2013. 
The U.N. has reported a steep increase in human rights violations by armed groups and security forces since December.
It has accused rebels of abducting civilians, shooting into crowds and burning down polling stations. It says state agents have tortured and killed civilians. 
""Impunity can fuel further violations and embolden the perpetrators,"" said Ravinda Shamdasani, the U.N.'s human rights representative. ""It is very important that the government sends a clear message that such violations will not be tolerated."" 

Meanwhile, Aboubakar Ali Siddick, a spokesman for a coalition of rebel groups known as the Coalition of Patriots for Change denied that the army has made significant headway and dismissed Sunday's vote as ""a masquerade"".

Domestic media had said Linda Reynolds, who is under pressure over her handling of the rape accusation, had called Brittany Higgins a ""lying cow"".
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has clarified that the remarks, made in Reynolds' private office, referred to her frustrations over suggestions that she did not give enough support to Higgins over the rape accusation against a colleague at Parliament House.
In a statement on Friday, Reynolds said she wanted to retract the remark and ""unreservedly apologise to Brittany Higgins and acknowledge the hurt and distress it caused to her"". 
Reynolds is on extended sick leave after the crisis broke and will miss next week's parliamentary session.
On Twitter, Higgins said she had accepted the apology, adding that an undisclosed sum forming part of the settlement would be paid to a Canberra organisation that counsels and supports survivors of sexual assault and abuse.
""This has been an immensely challenging period for me and I wish to reiterate that the only reason I have chosen to come forward is to help others,"" Higgins added.

Higgins did not immediately respond to an email request from Reuters to seek comment.

781,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 12:16AM ET</span>","A decade after Syria's war began, memories haunt a family it tore apart","DOUMA, Syria (Reuters) - Seham Hamu lost her husband, son and grand-daughter on the same night in 2016 when a missile struck their home in Douma, a rebel stronghold near the Syrian capital that saw some of the fiercest fighting of the civil war.
Now, aged 74 and confined to a wheelchair because of a heart condition, she looks after her son's four surviving children, a widowed daughter and a second daughter along with her husband and their children.
Their plight is not unusual in a country where hundreds of thousands of people have been killed during a decade of violence and millions more forced to flee their homes and settle elsewhere in Syria or abroad.
As the 10th anniversary of the start of the conflict in mid-March, 2011, approaches, Hamu just wants to forget.
""I don't want to remember...it was too cruel,"" she said of the war, a multi-sided conflict that sucked in Islamist militants, myriad rebel groups, government troops and foreign forces.
Hamu, who was born and bred in Douma, has never left the town, which still shows the scars of the violence.
It is back under government control after a Russian-backed military campaign helped President Bashar al-Assad force Jaish al-Islam, the rebel group which controlled Douma in 2018, to retreat.
The aerial bombing campaign that flushed them out followed a years-long siege of hundreds of thousands of residents, many of whom fled. Some who now want to return from Turkish-held areas in the north are not allowed.
Douma is part of the Eastern Ghouta region that touches the outskirts of Damascus.
Eastern Ghouta town was where a suspected chemical attack took place in April, 2018 that prompted missile strikes by the United States, France and Britain against several suspected chemical weapons facilities in Syria.
The Syrian government and its ally Russia have denied involvement in any such attack.
Assad has survived the insurgency, which started as peaceful protests in March, 2011, a part of the ""Arab Spring"" uprisings that shook Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia and beyond. But nowhere has the fallout been as devastating as in Syria.
From a precarious position, Assad now holds sway over many parts of the country, helped by Russia's military and Iran's Shi'ite militias.
Hostile Turkey still controls swathes of territory in the northwest and the United States has a presence in the northeast, a major oil and wheat producing area.
Prior to the conflict, Hamu lived with her farmer husband who owned a mini-market. Relatively well off, the family were able to secure marriages for the son Subhi and both daughters on the same night.
But the war escalated, and, on the fateful night in 2016, her life was shattered.
""I wish there had been no war and we lived in security. But this is God's will,"" she said.
The second floor of her traditional home is still charred and damaged by the flames that engulfed it in 2016, a permanent reminder of her loss.
TRICKLING BACK
People are gradually trickling back to Douma and other former rebel-held areas, now that the fighting has subsided.
More than half of Syria's pre-war population are either internally displaced inside Syria or refugees, according to new figures released by the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
Faris al-Barghout, who heads a local charity, says life is gradually returning to Douma, with schools and services back up and running. But the war has left its mark: there are around 3,200 orphans in the town registered with his charity alone.
""People are safe and have started to resume normal life,"" he said.
Shops and businesses are open and streets are busy with cars, as people go about their daily lives. 
But Hamu's son-in-law, Yassin al-Afa, does not hold out hope that he will get back to where he was before 2011 any time soon.
Afa was once a builder making enough income to support his family. Now he's jobless and confined to his bed after major back surgery, making physical labour impossible.
He said jobs were few and far between and he had no capital to start a business of his own.
""We were living like kings. We were working jobs and could provide for our household and there was something to look forward to,"" Afa said of life before the war. 
Hamu's family tragedy is not unique in Douma.
Umm Bashir al-Saour, a 37-year-old widowed by war, lives with her mother-in-law and four children in the same house.
She washes and cuts up lettuce to deliver to local restaurants for a weekly wage to make ends meet.
She lost her husband and one of her children in shelling during the final days of the conflict.
""We were hoping things would be better and that I wouldn't lose my husband, but he left us,"" she said. 

""It's too late for us now but I'm just hoping that things will be better for the children.""

782,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 09:35PM ET</span>",Explainer: What is China's Consumer Rights Day?,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The annual World Consumer Rights Day, on March 15, has become a major television and social media event in China, with domestic as well as foreign brands singled out for high-profile and sometimes damaging criticism.
World Consumer Rights Day began in 1983, and China began observing it three years later, shortly after the establishment of the China Consumers Association.
WHAT HAPPENS ON CHINA'S CONSUMER RIGHTS DAY?
In recent years, the run-up to March 15 is marked by various consumer education campaigns, with both government-backed groups and brands dispensing consumer rights information. 
The highlight is a two-hour prime-time show broadcast by state-run China Central Television (CCTV). Known as the ""315 Show"", the programme names and shames brands for issues ranging from poor-quality products, robocalls and illegal collection of personal information to aggressive sales of beauty salon memberships.
Big brands, fearful of being featured, are known to prepare responses ahead of time, just in case.
FOREIGN NAMES SINGLED OUT
Last year, in a broadcast delayed to July because of the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. fast food chain Burger King and a car manufactured by a General Motors (NYSE:GM) joint venture drew criticism.
In previous years, big-ticket foreign businesses that have come in for criticism have included Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), for charging higher prices in China than they did in the United States, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was bashed for a then one-year service warranty in China, shorter than in other markets.
Others scolded in the past include Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), for engine defects on an SUV;  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), for misleading advertising; and Japan's Muji, which came under fire for selling food products allegedly sourced from part of Japan affected by radiation.
Most of the criticism has been of Chinese brands.
In 2016, the programme criticised what it said was the widespread practice of sellers on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group's Taobao online marketplace to pump up sales figures to boost their credibility on the platform. 
Food-delivery company Ele.me, now owned by Alibaba, was once singled-out for working with restaurants that operate without licenses or proper kitchens.
WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF BEING NAMED? 
The brand reputations of named companies, and their share prices, can suffer.
 Qutoutiao  (NASDAQ:QTT), an app that delivers customised feeds of articles and short videos to users based on algorithms, was criticised last year for its advertising practices. New York-listed shares in the company, backed by Tencent, plunged 23% in the trading session following the show.
Named companies typically issue prompt responses, usually via their official acccounts on social media platforms Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) and WeChat, expressing gratitude for the oversight and criticism, and willingness to correct their behavior.

783,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 07:45PM ET</span>",U.S. House Republicans may follow Democrats in rebooting shamed 'earmarks',"By Jarrett Renshaw
(Reuters) - U.S. House Republicans are weighing whether to join Democrats in getting back into ""earmarks"" - the practice of loading spending bills with legislators' pet projects - and a decision is expected this week, two sources familiar with the process said . 
The sources said Republicans in the House of Representatives deliberated on the issue twice this week, and sentiment is growing toward embracing earmarks roughly a decade after the party decided to scrap the long-standing practice amid a raft of high-profile controversies. Democrats who control the House agreed to bring back earmarks this year. 
A move to participate in earmarks will draw criticism from the Republican Party's conservative wing, which has long criticized the practice as wasteful. It may also signal that Republicans are willing to negotiate on President Joe Biden's next major agenda item: a massive infrastructure package.
Earmarks are considered legislative ""sweeteners"" that Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, can use to dissuade its members from defecting on major bills and attract votes from Republicans who otherwise would reject the measure. 
If Republicans agree to participate in earmarks, they are signaling they could be engaged on an infrastructure bill and may be willing to give support if it means getting funding for popular projects in their districts.
""It would certainly suggest members are preparing for talks around the budget and infrastructure,"" said a source familiar with the discussions. 
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's office did not return calls and emails on Tuesday seeking comment. 
Senator Mitch McConnell, who leads the Republicans in the upper chamber, has not ruled out supporting earmarks. However, he would face opposition from members. 
Republican Senator Marco Rubio joined nine other senators in introducing legislation earlier this month that would permanently ban earmarks.
“For decades, Congress abused the trust and faith of the American people by handing out earmarks to well-connected businesses, campaign donors, and others who could afford a high-priced lobbyist,” Rubio said.
Earmarks became a hot campaign issue in the early 2000s after a long string of scandals in which lawmakers from both parties secured earmarks to enrich themselves. 
In 2005, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska inserted an earmark to build a $223 million bridge to connect Ketchikan and Gravina Island - population 50. Nicknamed the ""bridge to nowhere,"" it became a lightning rod for critics. 
Republican Representative Duke Cunningham of California resigned and pleaded guilty to accepting kickbacks from military contractors for steering business their way, using his positions on military committees to insert earmarks. In 2006, Cunningham was sentenced to eight years and four months in prison for accepting $2.4 million in bribes.
When Republicans took control of the House in 2011, they banned the practice. Urged by Democratic President Barack Obama, the Democratic Senate soon followed suit. Earmarks have been gone since.
Democratic lawmakers announced earlier this year that they were bringing back the practice, hoping it could solve a few issues, such as keeping their narrow majorities together on big votes, boosting vulnerable members’ re-election chances in 2022 and perhaps attracting Republican support. 

(This story corrects description of bridge in paragraph 12 to connecting with Ketchikan)

The two men were arrested in December 2018 shortly after Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada on a U.S. warrant. She faces charges of misleading  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) about the Chinese tech giant's business dealings with Iran, which is under U.S. sanctions. 
Global Times, published by the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, did not say when the trial might take place or in which court. Hearings for the two Canadians had been delayed due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the paper said. 
Canada and the United States have repeatedly demanded that China release Kovrig and Spavor, with Ottawa calling their arrest an act of ""hostage diplomacy"". 
Beijing has repeatedly denied accusations that the two Canadians' arrest was linked to Meng's arrest in Canada, however, and said the two men will be tried in accordance with Chinese law. 

The report comes days ahead of the first high-level bilateral meeting between Washington and Beijing officials since U.S. President Joe Biden took office in January.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - China, Russia, North Korea, Iran and others are seeking support for a coalition to defend the United Nations Charter by pushing back against the use or threat of force and unilateral sanctions, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday. 
The move by 16 countries and the Palestinians to create such a group comes as U.S. President Joe Biden's new administration boosts its multilateral engagement and with allies, reversing former President Donald Trump's favored unilateral approach as he focused on an ""America First"" policy.
Biden has also pledged to take on China at the United Nations, where Beijing has been pushing for greater global influence in a challenge to traditional U.S. leadership. 
A concept note for the ""Group of Friends in Defense of the Charter of the United Nations,"" seen by Reuters, states that multilateralism ""is currently under an unprecedented attack, which, in turn, threatens global peace and security.""
However, a senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, responded: ""These so-called friends are the ones who have done most to breach the charter. Maybe they should start by respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms in their own countries.""
Other founding members of the group are Algeria, Angola, Belarus, Bolivia, Cambodia, Cuba, Eritrea, Laos, Nicaragua, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Syria and Venezuela.
The concept note said ""the world is seeing a growing resort to unilateralism, marked by isolationist and arbitrary actions, including the imposition of unilateral coercive measures or the withdrawal from landmark agreements and multilateral institutions, as well as by attempts to undermine critical efforts to tackle common and global challenges.""
Under Trump, Washington announced plans to quit the World Health Organization, pulled out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, a global climate change accord and the Iran nuclear deal.

But Biden, who took office in January, rescinded the withdrawal from the WHO, returned the United States to the climate agreement, re-engaged with the Geneva-based Human Rights Council and is seeking to re-enter to the international nuclear deal.

President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and his Israeli counterpart, Meir Ben-Shabbat, headed the delegations, said Emily Horne, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council.
""During the discussion, the two sides shared perspectives on regional security issues of mutual interest and concern, including Iran, and expressed their common determination to confront the challenges and threats facing the region,"" she said in a statement, which provided few details.
The Biden administration has depicted the meeting as part of its efforts to consult allies and partners as its seeks to draw Iran into talks about Tehran and Washington resuming compliance with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. U.S. overtures to Iran have set the stage for possible new strains in the U.S.-Israel alliance.
Biden's White House predecessor, Donald Trump, withdrew the United States from the world powers' agreement with Iran, deeming it too advantageous for Tehran - a view Israel shared – and reimposed U.S. sanctions. Netanyahu has made clear his opposition to a U.S. return to the deal.
The State Department on Thursday repeated that the United States will not offer Iran unilateral incentives to attend talks that it has rejected so far about resuming compliance with the deal, which gave Tehran sanctions relief in return for limits on its nuclear program.
Israel hopes to prevent personal tension between Netanyahu and Biden over their differences on the Iranian nuclear question by delegating talks on the topic to their senior staff, an Israeli official said late last month.

""The National Security Advisors agreed on the importance of strategic interagency consultations and pledged to continue to these engagements,"" Horne said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Los Angeles Police Department commanders planned poorly for violent protests and looting that broke out following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, leading to a chaotic and inadequate response, an independent review said on Thursday.
The review, commissioned by city leaders following nationwide demonstrations and rioting last year, was released as the trial opens in Minneapolis for Derek Chauvin, the former police officer charged with killing Floyd on May 25, 2020.
""On May 27 and 28, the protests in downtown Los Angeles were marred by an escalating level of violence and criminality. Initially, the (Los Angeles Police) Department treated these as isolated incidents, rather than as a manifestation of a larger expression of outrage that was spreading across the United States,"" the report said.
The LAPD did not immediately respond to the report.
The review, headed by criminal defense attorney Gerald Chaleff, found that LAPD commanders failed to establish a clear command structure for directing its response to the outbreak of violence, leading to a ""chaos of command"" that left officers unsure of who was in charge as events unfolded.
""It appears the Department believed that if protests arising out of George Floyd’s death occurred in Los Angeles that they all would be peaceful,"" the report's authors said. ""In interviews with the Review Team, interviewees said they were surprised at the violence that occurred in the afternoon and evening hours at some protests.""
Other mistakes cited in the analysis included poor training of officers in use of non-lethal weapons, failing to anticipate that the protests could spread beyond the city's downtown and lack of field jails.

""Thousands of people were arrested throughout the protests without a clearly articulated plan for detentions, transportation and processing,"" the report said. ""Those arrested were detained at the scene of the arrests for hours, handcuffed on the pavement, detained in buses, and taken to remote locations, without water or the use of bathroom facilities.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday condemned Chinese moves to change Hong Kong's electoral system and forecast ""difficult"" talks with Beijing's top diplomats next week, when the genocide Washington says China is committing against minority Muslims will be an issue the U.S. side plans to raise.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan would not hold back when they meet with the Chinese diplomats in Alaska on March 18 and 19, ""whether it's on Taiwan, or ... efforts to push back democracy in Hong Kong, or on concerns we have about the economic relationship."" 
""Addressing the genocide against Uighur Muslims is something that will be a topic of discussion with the Chinese directly next week,"" she added.
China rejects U.S. charges that it has committed genocide against Uighur and other Muslims in its Xinjiang region and calls criticism of its behavior toward Hong Kong and self-ruled Taiwan unwarranted interference in its internal affairs.
China's parliament on Thursday approved a draft decision to change Hong Kong's electoral system, further reducing democratic representation in the city's institutions and introducing a mechanism to vet politicians' loyalty to Beijing.
State Department spokesman Ned Price called the changes ""a direct attack on Hong Kong’s autonomy, its freedoms and democratic processes.""
""There will be some difficult conversations I would expect,"" he said, referring to the talks Blinken and Sullivan plan to hold in Anchorage with China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and State Councillor Wang Yi, the first high-level in-person contacts between the two sparring countries under the Biden administration. {nL1N2L825Q]
Price said Washington would explore areas for cooperation with China where it was in the U.S. interest, including climate change, but called on Beijing to change if it wanted to improve the frayed relationship.
""We're not looking to engage in talks for the sake of talks,"" he said.
""We are looking for Beijing ... to demonstrate that seriousness of purpose, to demonstrate that it seeks to live up to its own oft-stated desire to change the tone of the bilateral relationship."" 
President Joe Biden's administration has committed to reviewing elements of U.S. policies toward China, as the world's two largest economies navigate relations that sank to their lowest depths in decades during Donald Trump's presidency.
Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first phone call as leaders last month and appeared at odds on most issues, even as Xi warned that confrontation would be a ""disaster"" for both nations.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday that China and the United States had common interests and many areas for cooperation and that Beijing hoped ties could develop in a healthy way based on respecting each other's core interests, win-win cooperation and non-interference in internal affairs.

""We will not offer any unilateral gestures or incentives to induce the Iranians to come to the table. If the Iranians are under the impression that, absent any movement on their part to resume full compliance with the (nuclear deal), that we will offer favors or unilateral gestures, well that's a misimpression,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. 
Price suggested Washington would consider each side taking steps to resume compliance with the agreement once they are at the negotiating table. 
""If and only if Tehran comes to the negotiating table would we be in a position, would we be prepared, to discuss proposals that would help push both sides back on that path of mutual compliance to the deal,"" he said. ""Ultimately, that is where we seek to go: compliance for compliance.""
Price was referring to the deal between Iran and six major powers under which Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for the easing of U.S. and other economic sanctions.
The deal made it harder for Iran's atomic program to be used to produce nuclear weapons, an ambition Tehran denies. Former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018 and restored U.S. sanctions on Iran, prompting Tehran to begin violating the deal's nuclear restrictions about a year later.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Andrew Cuomo ""just can't serve as governor anymore,"" adding his voice on Thursday to a growing chorus of calls for Cuomo to resign after six women accused him of sexual misconduct.
Cuomo, 63, has denied the allegations by the women, most of whom are former aides. The most recent is an unnamed aide who told The Times-Union newspaper on Tuesday that Cuomo had groped her after calling her to the executive mansion last year under the pretext of business. 
Reuters could neither independently verify the woman's identity, nor her account.
Cuomo denied the accusation, the Times-Union reported on Wednesday, saying ""I have never done anything like this,"" and called the details ""gut-wrenching."" Representatives for Cuomo did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
The governor issued a broad apology at a news conference last week for any behavior that made women feel uncomfortable, but maintained that he has never touched anyone inappropriately. 
The office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James is leading an independent investigation into the allegations. Cuomo has said he will not resign and has asked the public to await the results of that probe before making judgment. 
De Blasio, a longtime political rival of Cuomo, said on Thursday that the latest accusation was disturbing. 
""The specific allegation that the governor called an employee of his, someone who he had power over, called them to a private place and then sexually assaulted her, it's absolutely unacceptable,"" de Blasio told reporters. ""It is disgusting to me, and he can no longer serve as governor."" 
Calls for Cuomo to step down have been mounting since late February, when Cuomo's first accuser, a former aide and current Manhattan borough president candidate Lindsey Boylan, published an essay accusing him of making unwanted advances. 
The governor has also faced accusations in recent weeks that his administration sought to downplay the number of nursing home residents killed by COVID-19. 
Last weekend, the two top Democrats in New York's state legislature called on the governor to resign, saying the sexual misconduct allegations have undermined his ability to lead.
On Thursday, more than 55 Democratic New York legislators followed suit in a letter calling for Cuomo's resignation. 
""As legislators and as New Yorkers we all must decide what is best for the future of New York State,"" read the letter, which was posted on Twitter by one of its signatories, Democratic Assemblywoman Amanda Septimo of the South Bronx.
""Enough is enough,"" Septimo wrote.
Meanwhile, New York State Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs, a Cuomo appointee who last week urged the public to refrain from judging the governor before the state attorney general's review was complete, said he had reached an agreement with New York State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie that the legislature would begin its own review into the allegations. 

""With the preponderance of these allegations ... now is the time for the Legislature to commence its own review of these matters as a part of its Constitutional responsibilities,"" Jacobs said in a statement, adding that he had ""full confidence"" in the state attorney general's investigation.

The Association of African American Vintners says it has grown by 500% since 2019. But there is still much to do, said Phil Long, the organization's president and founder of Longevity Wines in Livermore, California.
    ""There are thousands and thousands of wineries in this country... and out of those wineries, what are there, a couple of dozen that are Black-owned,"" said Long.
""Once I realized how few there were and I started understanding the non-diverse landscape, that's when it became more of an element of who I am,"" he said.
    Long, and his late wife, Debra, created Longevity, vowing to be inclusive after an unsettling experience at a winery in Santa Barbara. Recounting how he waited to sample the wine, Long said, ""I stood there waiting ... and no one ever acknowledged me.""
Sunshine Foss, who opened Happy Cork Wine and Spirits in 2018 in Brooklyn, New York, at first found it challenging to stock shelves with Black-owned brands, but says now people are approaching her.
    ""A lot of the winemakers that I talk to... tell me, they would walk into wine stores, say, hey, I have this amazing product and people wouldn't even look at them,"" Foss said. ""So, for me, it's extremely important to be able to give this platform to a lot of these Black-owned wine makers.""

On Tuesday night the conservative commentator showed an Air Force photo of a 1st lieutenant modeling a maternity uniform, and said in the face of a growing threat from China the Pentagon could lose wars by drawing in more women. 
""While China's military becomes more masculine ... our military needs to become, as Joe Biden says, more feminine,"" Carlson said. ""This is a mockery of the U.S. military."" 
Responding on Thursday, the Pentagon said it was proud of the military's diversity and said it needed to do a better job of promoting women to senior ranks. 
""What we absolutely won't do is take personnel advise from a talk show host or the Chinese military,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told reporters. 
Kirby said he hoped Carlson would ""realize the mistake he made and express some regret about the manner in which he essentially demeaned the entire U.S. military and how we defend and how we serve this country.""
Fox News, which is regularly broadcast to service members deployed around the world on the military's own television channel, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
While gender diversity in the armed forces has been a stated goal of both Republican and Democratic administrations, women make up only about 16.5% of the active-duty military, a recent Government Accountability Office report found. That number is far lower among senior military officials.

""It was for protection so neither the military nor preventative police would arrest me or my brother in Honduras and so we would not be extradited to the United States,"" Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, a leader of the Honduran drug clan Los Cachiros, testified in the trial of alleged drug trafficker Geovanny Fuentes Ramirez.
Rivera said the money, which was paid in 2012 when Hernandez was head of Honduras' Congress, was delivered in cash to the president’s now-deceased sister, Hilda.
Hernandez, who is listed as a co-conspirator in the indictment of Fuentes Ramirez, has repeatedly denied any involvement in drug trafficking. Fuentes Ramirez pleaded not guilty on Monday. 

Rivera made a deal with the Drug Enforcement Administration in 2013 and turned himself in around two years later after the United States sanctioned shell companies Rivera said he owned.

797,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 02:00PM ET</span>","Myanmar junta accuses Suu Kyi of taking bribes, 12 protesters killed","(Reuters) - Myanmar's junta added new bribery allegations to its charges against deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Thursday, while an advocacy group said security forces killed 12 protesters in one of the deadliest days since the military took power.
The bloodshed came hours after the U.N. Security Council had called for restraint from the army, which has been trying to put down daily anti-coup protests and paralysing strikes since it took power on Feb. 1.
Among the dead were eight people killed in the central town of Myaing when security forces fired on a protest, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) said.
In Myanmar's biggest city, Yangon, protester Chit Min Thu was killed in the North Dagon district. His wife, Aye Myat Thu, told Reuters he had insisted on joining the protests despite her appeals for him to stay home for the sake of their son.
""He said it's worth dying for,"" she said through her tears. ""He is worried about people not joining the protest. If so, democracy will not return to the country.""
Adding corruption charges to the accusations against Suu Kyi could mean she faces a harsher penalty. She currently faces four comparatively minor charges - including illegally importing six walkie talkie radios and flouting coronavirus restrictions.
The junta spokesman, Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun, said Suu Kyi had accepted illegal payments worth $600,000, as well as gold, while in government, according to a complaint by Phyo Mien Thein, a former chief minister of Yangon.
""He strongly said that,"" the spokesman told a news conference. ""We have verified those facts several times. Now the anti-corruption committee is continuing the investigation.""
Aye Ma Ma Myo, a member of the dissolved parliament belonging to Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, rejected the claim.
""It is no longer uncommon to see slander against politicians and efforts to crush the party while innocent young people are killed in public,"" she told Reuters in a message.
FUNERAL
Another funeral was held for an official from Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), who died in custody after being arrested early on Tuesday. Mourners wept over the open coffin, which showed Zaw Myat Linn's badly disfigured face.
Thursday's deaths brought the number of protesters killed since the coup to more than 70, the AAPP said. Some 2,000 people have also been detained since the coup against Suu Kyi's elected government, it says.
The army did not respond to requests for comment on the latest deaths but the junta spokesman said the security forces were disciplined and used force only when necessary.
U.N. human rights investigator Thomas Andrews told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva the military may have committed crimes against humanity. He called for multilateral sanctions on the junta and the state energy firm, Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise.
Amnesty International accused the army of using lethal force against protesters and said many killings it had documented amounted to extra-judicial executions.
""These are not the actions of overwhelmed, individual officers making poor decisions,"" said Joanne Mariner, Amnesty's director of crisis response.
""These are unrepentant commanders already implicated in crimes against humanity, deploying their troops and murderous methods in the open.""
Suu Kyi, 75, fought for decades to overturn military rule under previous juntas before the start of tentative democratic reforms in 2011. She had spent a total of around 15 years under house arrest.
The army has justified taking power by saying that a November election, overwhelmingly won by Suu Kyi's party, was marred by fraud - an assertion rejected by the electoral commission. 
Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun reiterated that the military would only be in charge for a certain period before holding an election. The junta has said a state of emergency will last for a year, but has not set a date for the election.
The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday condemned violence against protesters and urged the army to show restraint.
But language that would have denounced the military takeover as a coup or threatened possible further action was removed from the British-drafted text, due to opposition by China, India, Russia and Vietnam.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he hoped the Security Council statement would push the military to realise it ""is absolutely essential"" that all prisoners are released and the results of the November election are respected.
In Myanmar, state media said the junta had removed an insurgent group, the Arakan Army (AA), from a list of terrorist groups because it had stopped attacks in order to help establish peace across the country.

The AA, which is fighting for greater autonomy in the western state of Rakhine, had become one of the most formidable forces in challenging an army that has been fighting various ethnic wars for seven decades.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's lower house of Congress approved the basic text of a bill on Thursday that revives a federal cash transfer program to help millions of poor families whose incomes have been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The measure will allow emergency stipends totaling up to 44 billion reais ($7.96 billion) to be paid to low-income Brazilians over the next four months, with recipients expected to get an average of 250 reais per month.
The chamber cast 366-127 votes for the constitutional amendment in a second of two rounds of voting, more than in the first-round when it was approved by 341 votes.
Brazil's Senate passed the amendment last week.
The aid package will not be subject to the government's usual fiscal rules, but the bill includes counter measures delivering fiscal savings in the coming years to mitigate the impact on fragile public finances.
Economy Ministry and central bank officials, as well as investors, have warned that any increase in spending must be matched by savings elsewhere in the budget to show the government's long-term commitment to reducing its record debt.
The government's emergency aid to millions of poor families last year totaled some 322 billion reais, worth around 4.5% of GDP, and expired on Dec. 31. It ensured the economy's 4.1% slump last year was nowhere near as bad as many had originally feared, but it also fueled a record budget deficit and public debt.

Health authorities in Denmark, Norway and Iceland on Thursday suspended the use of AstraZeneca's shot following reports of the formation of blood clots in some people who had been vaccinated.
Veran said the French drug safety agency, in line with its European Union counterpart, had advised that there was no reason to suspend injections with the AstraZeneca vaccine.
""The benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine are considered higher than the risks at this point,"" Veran said at the government's weekly coronavirus briefing. 
He said investigations were continuing in France and abroad and added that Britain - which has vaccinated millions with the AstraZeneca shot - advised continuing with it and had not noted large-scale excess risk related to the vaccine.
Veran, who is a neurologist, said that for about five million Europeans vaccinated with AstraZeneca, only about 30 people have experienced blood coagulation problems, which is in line with the number of cases one would expect for five million people who had not been vaccinated. 

""We are looking systematically at each declared case of undesired serious side-effects ... each case is analysed for a link of causality with the vaccination, which so far has not been formally identified,"" Veran said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nearly 30 years ago a malnourished two-year-old girl died in front of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield at a refugee camp in northern Uganda. Two days ago U.N. food chief David Beasley met a starving five-month-old girl at a hospital in Yemen - she died on Thursday.
""What's the difference today?"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""Today we should have better information ... We can save lives if we know where to go and if we put the funding toward it."" 
Thomas-Greenfield and Beasley both recounted these stories during a U.N. Security Council meeting on food security, where U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that more than 30 million people in over three dozen countries are ""just one step away from a declaration of famine.""
""Famine and hunger are no longer about lack of food. They are now largely man-made – and I use the term deliberately. They are concentrated in countries affected by large-scale, protracted conflict,"" Guterres told the 15-member body. 
He announced the creation of a high-level U.N. task force on preventing famine led by U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock. 
""Parts of Yemen, South Sudan and Burkina Faso are in the grip of famine or conditions akin to famine,"" Guterres said. ""The Democratic Republic of the Congo experienced the world's largest food crisis last year, with nearly 21.8 million people facing acute hunger between July and December.""
Guterres, Beasley and Thomas-Greenfield also raised particular concern about food shortages in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, where Ethiopian government troops began an offensive against Tigray's former ruling party after regional forces attacked federal army bases in the region in November. 
""Food stocks are depleted. Acute malnutrition is rising. The ongoing violence has prevented humanitarians from helping desperately hungry people,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. 

In war-torn South Sudan, Guterres said 60% of people are increasingly hungry: ""Food prices are so high that just one plate of rice and beans costs more than 180% of the average daily salary – the equivalent of about $400 here in New York.""

801,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 01:10PM ET</span>",Sudanese militia leader Musa Hilal freed after pardon,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - A Sudanese militia leader accused by rights groups of atrocities in Darfur was released from a Khartoum prison on Wednesday following a pardon by Sudan's ruling council, the movement he heads said in a statement.
Human rights groups accused Musa Hilal of coordinating Arab militias blamed for atrocities during a conflict in Darfur that left an estimated 300,000 dead and 2.5 million displaced. 
Hilal has previously denied responsibility for atrocities, saying he mobilised his tribesmen to defend their lands after a government call to popular defence against non-Arab rebels.
Darfur's conflict escalated in 2003 as the rebels rose up against Khartoum, and then-President Omar al-Bashir relied on militias loyal to Hilal to help suppress the revolt.
After turning against Bashir, Hilal was captured in November 2017 by forces belonging to the current deputy leader of Sudan's ruling council, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. 
The military-civilian council is leading Sudan through a transition after Bashir was overthrown and jailed in 2019 following months of popular protests.
Several of the rebel groups that fought in Darfur signed a peace deal with transitional authorities last year and have taken positions in the government.
Dagalo and Hilal, who both hail from the Rizeigat tribe, remain in competition for political and economic influence in Darfur. Both have held gold mining interests in the region. 
Despite Hilal's detention, many of the Arab militias still active in Darfur remain loyal to him, and he remains leader of the Sudanese Revolutionary Awakening Council movement.
A U.N. report issued in January said Hilal's supporters had become increasingly disgruntled over the detention of their leader and some had turned to military action in Darfur's Jebel Marra area and in Libya.

Hilal is subject to an asset freeze and travel ban under U.N. sanctions but is not sought by the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC is seeking Bashir and three other Sudanese suspects on charges relating to Darfur.

Anger over the scandal is compounding frustration among Germans with Merkel's conservative-led coalition over a sluggish coronavirus vaccine rollout caused by supply shortages and excessive bureaucracy.
Support for the conservatives has slipped in the states of Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rheinland-Palatinate where Sunday's elections will be a crucial gauge of popular feeling before a September federal election.
Mark Hauptmann from the eastern state of Thuringia told the Christian Democrats (CDU) he would give up his seat in parliament, his office confirmed on Thursday, after allegations that he helped contacts in Azerbaijan with procurement. 
Asked by Die Welt whether he had brokered mask deals for his constituency and received a commission for it, Hauptmann said he had helped but had not received any payment.
""I was neither involved in arranging it nor did I receive a commission for it,"" he told the paper. 
In the last week, the CDU's Nikolas Loebel has given up his seat and Bavarian conservative Georg Nuesslein stepped down from the parliamentary party. Both had been accused of receiving payments for brokering face mask procurement deals.
Fearing a wider scandal, the parliamentary groups of the CDU and its CSU Bavarian sister party have demanded that all conservative lawmakers declare they have not profited from consulting or procurement activities linked to the pandemic.
The latest poll, from Forsa, puts the conservative bloc on 33%, down from 40% in June when Merkel had won plaudits for her management of the coronavirus crisis in its first phase. She will not seek a fifth term as chancellor in September.

However, Germany is facing a third wave of infections. Cases posted their biggest increase in five weeks on Thursday, and with vaccination rates lagging behind those in Britain, Israel and the United States, Germans are growing impatient.

Southern EU countries reliant on tourism hope such ""passports"" would help unlock its summer season this year but ran into opposition from Germany, France and Belgium stressing that inoculation is neither obligatory nor available to all.
""We are working on a certificate - it's not a passport - but it's not only about vaccination. It about recovery for the people who had sickness, vaccination or test,"" European Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said on Thursday. 
""We don't have mandatory vaccine so it's possible to refuse to be vaccinated. And we don't have for the moment the capacity to organise vaccination for all the people who want to be vaccinated. We don't want to have any discrimination.""
The EU's slow rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has been widely criticised, with only about 5% of people inoculated so far and the bloc's target of inoculating 70% of its adult population by the end of the summer seen to be increasingly in question. 
But, keen to revive economic growth mauled by the pandemic, the bloc's 27 national leaders agreed last month to prepare joint rules for such COVID-19 ""green certificates"" before the summer. 

They must yet agree, however, how exactly to use them and what travel rights would be attached.

Mangoush, a lawyer who had a role in the transitional council that briefly governed Libya after its 2011 uprising, will be joined by four other women in the cabinet, including Halima Abdulrahman as justice minister. 
""I think this is a win for all of us women in Libya. I hope it's a first step to going further: a woman reaching head of government,"" said Afia Mohammed, 34, a pastry maker in Tripoli, adding it would encourage more women to enter politics. 
Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibeh's interim government emerged through a United Nations talks process and is mandated to unify Libya's divided state institutions and oversee national elections in December.
The 75 Libyan delegates selected by the U.N. to take part in those talks laid out a commitment for the new government to include women in 30% of senior government roles, including in top cabinet posts.
Women represent only 15% of the posts in Dbeibeh's cabinet but the proportion will rise when deputy ministers are appointed, he has said. 
Elham Saudi, a lawyer and talks delegate, said: ""It's a stepping stone towards fuller representation."" 
She said the quota was a result of women in the forum being ""absolutely relentless on this point"" despite having big differences on other political issues. 
As the first meeting took place in Tunis, where Saudi said women delegates faced a barrage of sexist online abuse, a women's rights lawyer, Hanan al-Barassi, was shot dead on a busy Benghazi street. 
When the Libyan state crumbled after 2011 and myriad warring factions seized territory, women suffered a wave of violence and those in official positions were nearly all men - until now. 
""This will give an opportunity for other women to join the work in sovereign positions. The five ministers will be role models,"" said Lamees BenSaad, a women's rights activist and another member of the U.N. talks forum. ""We have been fighting a long time for this gain.""
Opposition to women having a big public role is not only held by men. Tahani Qarouq, who makes wedding delicacies in Tripoli, said she did not agree with women running cabinet ministries or state institutions. 
But Hanan Malouda, selling beauty products in the market, said women in government would be good for Libya. ""Hopefully they will have more compassion for us,"" she said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights investigator on Myanmar said on Thursday the military junta had ""murdered"" at least 70 people since its Feb. 1 coup, perpetrating killings, torture and persecution that may constitute crimes against humanity.
More than half of those killed were under the age of 25, Thomas Andrews told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.
More than 2,000 people have been unlawfully detained since the military seized power and the violence is steadily increasing, he said. 
""The country of Myanmar is being controlled by a murderous, illegal regime,"" said Andrews.
""There is extensive video evidence of security forces viciously beating protesters, medics, and bystanders.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - At the request of President Joe Biden's administration, the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday canceled an upcoming oral argument on a policy introduced under his predecessor Donald Trump backing work requirements for people who receive healthcare under the Medicaid program for the poor.
The court granted a request made by Acting Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar on Feb. 22, who said the new administration has started the process of reversing the previous policy. The oral argument concerning pilot programs adopted by the states of Arkansas and New Hampshire had been scheduled for March 29.
Under Trump, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 2018 approved the pilot projects in those two states as part of a push to put a conservative stamp on Medicaid, a program that was expanded under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, to provide medical coverage to millions more Americans.

Biden, a Democrat, succeeded Trump, a Republican, on Jan. 20. Under Biden, HHS made a preliminary finding that work requirements would be inconsistent with the objectives of Medicaid, which provides medical insurance for the poor, Prelogar told the court.
Biden's Justice Department has reversed course in several cases originally filed by the Trump administration. In response to one such shift, the court on Tuesday dismissed an upcoming case on Trump's policy barring immigrants deemed likely to need government benefits from legal permanent residency.
The Supreme Court on Feb. 3 canceled oral arguments in two other cases after Biden's administration changed course from Trump policies. Both were appeals by Trump's administration - one defending his funding of the U.S.-Mexico border wall and the other defending his so-called ""remain in Mexico"" asylum policy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 3,600 migrant children were being held in U.S. border facilities as of Thursday morning, a U.S. official told Reuters, more than four times the number in late February, a sign of a growing humanitarian and political crisis for President Joe Biden's new administration.
The number of mostly Central American unaccompanied children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border has risen rapidly in recent weeks, with more children stuck in border patrol stations while they await transfers to increasingly crowded federal shelters and eventual release to parents or other sponsors. 
The border stations were built to house adult men for short periods and could pose a COVID-19 health risk to children and staff if they grow overcrowded. Last week, U.S. health officials lifted coronavirus-related capacity restrictions on shelters for unaccompanied minors to alleviate the housing crunch, but beds have been filling up quickly.
Biden, a Democrat who took office seven weeks ago, pledged to undo many of the restrictive policies of former President Donald Trump, a Republican. In February he began allowing unaccompanied minors arriving at the border to enter the country. They had previously been sent back to Mexico or rapidly deported under a Trump-era order known as Title 42. 
Republicans have savaged Biden for rolling back Trump's hardline policies, saying his administration has encouraged illegal immigration. At the same time, Democrats have criticized Biden for keeping some Trump policies and for reopening an emergency shelter in Texas that was used under Trump.
The arrivals resemble previous surges of unaccompanied minors and families in 2014 and 2019, according to officials and experts. The roughly 3,600 children in U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) custody is up from around 800 on Feb. 22.

CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prince William denied on Thursday that Britain's royals were racist after Meghan, wife of his younger brother Harry, said one unnamed member of the family had asked how dark their son Archie's skin might be.
Meghan, 39, made the allegation during an explosive tell-all interview that she and Harry, 36, gave to Oprah Winfrey and which was aired on Sunday, plunging the British monarchy into its biggest crisis since the 1997 death of Princess Diana, William and Harry's mother.
On a visit to a school in east London, William said he had not talked to Harry since the interview was broadcast just over three days ago.
""I haven't spoken to him yet but I will do,"" William, 38, said. 
Asked by a reporter if the royal family was racist, William said: ""We're very much not a racist family.""
In the two-hour show, nearly three years after their star-studded wedding in Windsor Castle, Meghan said the royals had ignored her pleas for help while she felt suicidal. 
Harry said his father, heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, had let him down and that he had felt trapped.
On Tuesday, Buckingham Palace issued a statement on behalf of 94-year-old Queen Elizabeth, the princes' grandmother, in which she said the family were saddened by how challenging the couple had found the last few years.
But it was the couple's accusation that one of the royals had made a racist comment which has dominated coverage and has the potential to cause lasting damage to the 1,000-year-old monarchy.
WHO SAID IT?
Meghan, whose mother is Black and father is white, said while she was pregnant with Archie there were ""concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he's born.""
Neither she nor Harry said who had made the remark, although Winfrey later clarified that Harry had said it was not the queen or her 99-year-old husband Philip, who has been in hospital for three weeks while the crisis unfolds.
""That conversation, I'm never going to share,"" Harry said during the interview. ""But at the time, it was awkward. I was a bit shocked.""
In the statement from the queen, the palace said issues of race were concerning and would be treated very seriously, but pointedly stated ""some recollections may vary"". The Palace has said that it was a family matter that should be dealt with privately.
The interview, watched by 12.4 million viewers in Britain and 17.1 million in the United States, has proved divisive among the British public. 
For some, Meghan's accusations confirmed their belief that the monarchy is an outdated and intolerant institution, while others decried it as a self-serving assault that neither Elizabeth nor her family deserved.
The crisis over Meghan and Harry comes a year after his uncle Prince Andrew was forced to quit royal duties following a disastrous TV interview to explain his friendship with late U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in a U.S. prison while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
Polls show the division has fallen mainly down generational lines, with those aged over 65 backing the queen and the senior royals, while younger people supported Harry and Meghan.
The divided response - part of what commentators say is a wider ""culture war"" waging on social and traditional media - was exemplified by reactions to pugnacious presenter Piers Morgan losing his high-profile breakfast TV slot after saying he did not believe Meghan.
His remarks had attracted 41,000 complaints to Britain's media regulator.
MEDIA BACKLASH
The couple, who quit their royal roles to move to California last year, have also spoken out about what they say is press reporting tainted by racism, and Harry said his family had failed to call out ""colonial undertones"" in articles. 
""That hurts, but I also am acutely aware of where my family stand and how scared they are of the tabloids turning on them,"" Harry, who said the tabloids' behaviour was a major reasons why he had left Britain, told Winfrey.
The couple's criticism of the media prompted a rebuttal from the Society of Editors, which represents many of the tabloids, saying it was ""not acceptable"" for the couple to make claims of racism in the press ""without supporting evidence"". 
However, its head, Ian Murray, stepped down over those comments after being accused of trying to defend racism, which he denied.
Also worryingly for the monarchy in the long term, surveys have indicated that the popularity of the Elizabeth's heir Charles, 72, has also fallen amid the crisis.
During the interview, Harry also laid bare how distant he had become from the other members of his family, saying his father had stopped taking his calls at one point, and that there was ""space"" in his relationship with William.

""Much will continue to be said about that ... as I said before, you know, I love William to bits, he's my brother, we've been through hell together and we have a shared experience,"" he said. ""But we're on different paths.""

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan political leaders including former president Hamid Karzai are mulling whether to attend a meeting organised by Russia to jumpstart Afghanistan's peace process as diplomacy by foreign powers including Washington ramps up.
Russia plans to hold a conference on Afghanistan in Moscow on March 18 and has invited several regional players. It comes at a crunch time for the peace process as a May 1 deadline for foreign troops to withdraw from Afghanistan looms and the United States reviews its plans.
Peace negotiations between the Afghan government and insurgent Taliban in Qatar's capital Doha have struggled to make progress. Mohammed Naeem, a spokesman for the Taliban, told Reuters it had received an invitation from Moscow, but had not yet decided whether to attend or not.
A source close to the Taliban said on condition of anonymity that a team of around four-five members of the Islamist group's political office in Doha would attend the conference. 
Former president Karzai, his former vice-president Karim Khalili as well as former warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar have received invitations, their spokespeople said. Only Khalili confirmed he would attend.
President Ashraf Ghani and top peace official and former presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah were also considering whether to join the conference, their offices said. 
The summit comes at a sensitive time as Ghani faces pressure after U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad proposed plans for a transitional government during a regional visit last week, an option Ghani rejected in a fiery speech over the weekend saying only elections could determine the government.
Khalilzad is proposing a separate conference in Turkey in coming weeks, asking for the United Nations to run it.
Diplomatic sources say the United States, Pakistan and China have also been invited to attend on March 18. The U.S. State Department has said it has ""nothing to confirm"" on the matter.
A spokesman for Pakistan's foreign ministry did not respond to request for comment. 
A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry did not confirm or deny receiving an invitation, but said: ""China is actively studying the multilateral meetings on Afghanistan proposed by Russia.""

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - A Minnesota judge granted a request by prosecutors on Thursday to reinstate a charge of third-degree murder against Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who is on trial already facing second-degree murder and manslaughter charges.
Judge Peter Cahill's decision comes after the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that he must reconsider a third-degree murder charge against 44-year-old Chauvin, whose trial got underway with jury selection this week in Minneapolis.
""I have to follow the rule that the court of appeals has put in place,"" Cahill said in explaining his decision.
Chauvin already faces a more serious charge of second-degree murder, which carries a sentence of up to 40 years in prison, as well as a charge of second-degree manslaughter. 
The reinstatement of a third-degree murder charge was a victory for state prosecutors, who had sought the additional lesser murder charge in part to afford them an extra path to a conviction should the jury find the evidence does not support the most serious charge. The third-degree murder charge carries a sentence of up to 25 years in prison.
Chauvin's charges stem from his actions during the arrest of George Floyd on May 25, 2020. Videos show Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes on a sidewalk outside a grocery store as the Black man pleaded for his life and then stopped moving. Police were arresting him on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at the store.
Floyd's death outraged people around the world and helped fuel one of the largest protest movements ever seen in the United States, with daily demonstrations against racism and police brutality.
Lawyers for Chauvin had successfully argued the third-degree murder charge should be dropped on the basis that the statute requires the “death-causing act” not be directed at a single individual. It is often used in instances where someone uses deadly force against a crowd of people, for example.
But the Minnesota Court of Appeals recently ruled in a separate case that third-degree murder could be applied even if the “death-causing act” is directed at a specific person, and ruled on Friday that this precedent binds the district court.

Jury selection for Chauvin's trial was set to resume Thursday morning, with five jurors already seated.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - General Manuel Baquedano Gonzalez, a 19th century hero of Chile's War of the Pacific, is caught in a new battle: his statue drenched in blood-red paint and set on fire as protests reignite in the Andean country's capital.
Positioned in Santiago's iconic Plaza Italia, the center of protests that began in October 2019, it has become a lightning rod for anger at the establishment.
It has been drenched in paint, repainted custard yellow by the authorities, daubed in graffiti, bashed with sledgehammers and set alight during protests that started in October 2019 over the high cost of living in Chile and inequality.
On Wednesday night, with fears mounting that protesters could topple it entirely, Chile's National Monuments Council announced it would remove the statue for repairs. 
On Thursday though, with protesters expected to gather in large numbers to mark the third and final year of unpopular President Sebastian Pinera in office, the bronze militaryman remained conspicuously on his plinth, guarded by armed police. 
Critics of the statue say Baquedano represents a Chilean elite that repressed indigenous people.
Last week, the army issued a furious statement after it was doused with fuel and set alight, accusing the perpetrators of being ""ignorant"", ""anti-Chilean"" and ""cowards."" 
Daniel Jadue, the Communist Party's candidate in this year's presidential election, responded by calling for the army chief's resignation and recalled the military's role in Chile's 1973-1990 dictatorship, saying: 
""This reinforces the nefarious idea of an enemy in our midst that led that institution to commit the worst crimes in our history.""
The episode underscores how deeply polarised Chile remains despite more than a year of battling a pandemic from which it is slowly emerging thanks to one of the world's most rapid vaccination campaigns.
The vaccine drive has bolstered the beleaguered government´s approval ratings significantly but Pinera`s only minimally.
Protests still simmer despite movement restrictions, with several hundreds of people gathering each Friday and more on prominent dates calling for Pinera's resignation, firmer sanctions against police for rights abuses committed against protesters and better treatment of indigenous people. 
Victor Herrero, founder of independent Chilean news website Interferencia, said despite the drafting of a new constitution underway and Pinera´s term ending, fury over systemic inequality heightened by the pandemic would continue to bubble up. 

""The pandemic uncovered the failings of Chile´s neoliberal economic model,"" he said. ""There is too much uncertainty in our path. I think we have a decade of instability ahead.""

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast faced shock and uncertainty on Thursday following the death of Prime Minister Hamed Bakayoko, the West African nation's second premier to die in office in less than eight months.
A close ally of President Alassane Ouattara, Bakayoko, who died of cancer a few days after his 56th birthday, was appointed prime minister in July 2020 after the death of his predecessor Amadou Gon Coulibaly, Ouattara's handpicked successor.
Although Ouattara named his chief of staff Patrick Achi as interim prime minister on Monday while Bakayoko was in hospital, Bakayoko's passing leaves a vacuum for Ouattara to fill as he continues his search for a potential successor. 
""It will be difficult to replace him because of his standing, his way of doing things,"" Abdijan resident Maturin Bamouni said. ""Even when they are not from his political side, he still managed to sort things out.""
A central figure in Ivorian politics over the past two decades as the country was plunged into a prolonged conflict and a partition, Bakayoko, a jovial character with roots in media and showbiz, emerged as a conciliatory figure, able to talk to all sides of the conflict. 
""Bakayoko meant everything for Ivorians, a minister who listened to the whole population, even the opposition,"" Abdijan resident Kevin Bigore told Reuters.
His capacity to gain the trust of all sides including former rebel soldiers who staged a series of mutinies in 2017, threatening a fragile peace in the world's top cocoa producing nation, saw him appointed as defence minister in 2017, and kept the portfolio when he became prime minister. 
He ended the mutinies and carried out reforms that helped keep soldiers away from the political scene during the October 2020 presidential election, said Abidjan-based historian and military analyst Arthur Banga. 
""He succeeded in building trust between the soldiers, the chain of command and the regime, which contributed a lot to the stability observed from 2017 until now,"" Banga said.
Guillaume Soro, a former rebel leader who later led a government with Bakayoko as a minister before falling out with the current government, said he had lost a friend and a brother.

""The circumstances of life have unfortunately led us to take different political paths, opposed and sometimes conflicting, but we have known, above all, to keep and preserve our brotherhood and our mutual affection,"" Soro said.

An Israeli military spokeswoman had no immediate comment. At the time of the blast, the Israeli military had denied it had any involvement in the incident.
The incident came at a time when Palestinian militants have been test-firing rockets into the sea, and a Gaza-based human rights group, the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, said on Sunday the fishing boat may have been hit by accident.
But Eyad Al-Bozom, the Gaza Interior Ministry's spokesman, said no Palestinian rocket had hit the fishing boat, and that parts of an Israeli quadcopter drone that carried explosives were discovered in its nets. The drone had blown up as the fishermen were lifting their nets, killing all three. 
Bozom said the drone had probably been in the water since an Israeli attack on a Palestinian naval craft on Feb. 22 off Gaza.
The Israeli military said at the time its forces noticed suspicious naval activity off Gaza's shore and thwarted a ""potential threat to Israeli naval vessels"", without elaborating on the weapons used.
The Israeli military rarely comments publicly on the use of explosives-carrying drones.

Hamas, an Islamist militant group, took control of Gaza in 2007, and the seaside strip, home to 2 million Palestinians, has since been under a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt, which cite security concerns for the measure.

Foreign Minister Ayman al Safadi confirmed the planned visit, which Israel earlier said had been scheduled for Wednesday but cancelled over a dispute regarding security arrangements at the site, which it did not specify.
Safadi said Prince Hussein Bin Abdullah had planned to join Palestinian worshippers during a service in the mosque, which is Islam’s third holiest site and located in Jerusalem's walled Old City, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Jews revere the site as the vestige of their two ancient temples, and it has often been a flashpoint of Israeli-Palestinian violence.
Safadi said Israel had changed the crown prince's programme agreed with Amman and the move was seen as compromising the right of Palestinians and other Muslims to worship at the site.
""The Aqsa in its entirety is a place of worship for Muslims and Jordan won't allow any interference in its affairs and Israel has no sovereignty over it,"" Safadi said on state TV.
Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its ""eternal and indivisible capital"". It annexed East Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, after the 1967 conflict, in a move that has not won international recognition.
Jordan's Hashemite ruling family is the custodian of the Muslim and Christian holy sites in East Jerusalem.
Israel recognised the Hashemite role as safekeepers of al-Aqsa as part of the two countries' 1994 peace treaty, and maintains overall security control over the holy site.
Amman has long condemned what it says are Israeli efforts to restrict non-Jewish access to the 35-acre (14-hectare) compound, known to Muslims as the Noble (OTC:NEBLQ) Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount.
Israel cites security concerns for restricting the access of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank to the site and any limits it imposes on the number of Muslim worshippers allowed into the compound.

France has spearheaded international efforts to rescue the former French protectorate from its deepest crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war by trying to use Paris' historical influence to persuade squabbling politicians to adopt a reform roadmap and form a new government to unlock international aid.
""I would be tempted to qualify Lebanese politicians as guilty of not helping a country in danger,"" Jean-Yves le Drian told a news conference in Paris.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Tucked between rows of apartment blocks on an Athens street, a strip of green with a few trees, some plants and a bench offers a breathing space in the surrounding crush of concrete.
The Greek capital has started creating ""pocket parks"", transforming small plots once ridden with garbage and weeds, in a bid to tackle its chronic pollution.
""It's about creating green spaces, lowering the temperatures, giving quality of life and creating new reference points inside the city,"" Athens Mayor Kostas Bakoyannis said.
The city had a population explosion in the decades after World War Two when migration from rural areas fuelled uncontrolled building. 
The concept of 'antiparochi' - owners exchanging land plots for apartments - became widespread. 
Detached houses were replaced by rows of blocks. With more people came more cars and smog, in a city where temperatures can top 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) during a heatwave. 
""Trees were cut down, houses were built, residential areas were created, but at the same time, traffic congestion problems increased,"" said Christos Zerefos, head of the Athens Academy Research Centre for Atmospheric Physics and Climatology.
Over the decades, the capital tried several measures to curb traffic pollution, which also damages ancient monuments. The 2004 Olympics brought new highways to bypass central streets, a subway and the airport's move out of the city.
But cradled by mountains, Athens can be stifling during heatwaves when no northern trade winds are blowing and pollutants are trapped in the urban basin.
Climate change will only make things worse, scientists say.
Now the city is closing traffic lanes and transforming them into bike routes, pedestrian walks and small areas of greenery - all in a bid to cut down on vehicles, which account for 70% of greenhouse gas emissions.
The pocket parks are also doing their bit. ""It lets us breathe a bit, because the way we are here ... we are suffocating,"" said 65-year-old Dimitra from the densely populated neighbourhood of Kypseli.
Fountains, which lower temperatures and improve air quality, are also being repaired.
The city's mayor, Bakoyannis, said he took advantage of the lockdown in March when traffic pollution fell by as much as 50%, to push the project forward. 

""The time of cars has passed. Now the challenge is to find a new balance,"" he said.

BRUSSELS/WARSAW (Reuters) - People living in same-sex couples will be barred from adopting children in Poland even as single parents, under a new law from a nationalist ruling party which has made anti-gay policies a major part of its governing platform.
Poland already bans same-sex couples from adopting children together. But some families were able to get around this ban by having one member of a couple adopt children singly. That will now be explicitly banned.
""We are preparing a change where (...) people living in cohabitation with a person of the same sex could not adopt a child, so a homosexual couple will not be able to adopt a child,"" said Deputy Justice Minister Michal Wojcik.
Adoption agencies running background checks would be required to pay ""special attention"" to whether a single person seeking to adopt is living in a homosexual relationship, he said.
Poland's curbs on gay rights, which are being mimicked in Hungary, has put Warsaw and Budapest on a collision course with the EU, which has also criticised the two ex-Communist states over judicial independence, hostility to immigration and other issues.
Over the past two years, more than 100 towns and cities in Poland have declared themselves ""LGBT-free zones"". The EU has responded by threatening to withhold some European funds from such towns, which the Polish government has offered to replace.
The European Parliament is due to vote on Thursday on a resolution that would declare the entire 27-nation European Union an ""LGBTIQ Freedom Zone"". The resolution states that ""LGBTIQ rights are human rights"".
Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) Party says gay rights are a threat to the country's Roman Catholic lifestyle. 
Its critics say it has turned to politics of bigotry to cling to power, particularly since an election last year, which PiS incumbent President Andrzej Duda narrowly won with an appeal to conservative voters focused on anti-gay messages.

The Philippine economy was among the fastest growing in Asia before the COVID-19 pandemic, but strict and lengthy restrictions to limit coronavirus contagion have dampened consumer spending and left millions jobless.
""I have to reopen the economy. I have given a timetable of just weeks,"" Duterte said in a speech at a provincial airport inauguration. ""The economy must be opened in a short while.""
It would reopen if millions, especially those living around big cities, are already vaccinated, the firebrand leader added.
The Philippines, which has the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Southeast Asia, started its vaccination programme on March 1 with 600,000 Sinovac shots donated by China.
The health ministry on Thursday recorded 3,749 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily increase in cases in nearly six months, and 63 additional deaths.
Authorities have warned the public not to be complacent and continue to practice physical distancing to avoid the spread of the virus accelerating further.

The Philippines aims to inoculate 70 million of its 108 million population to achieve herd immunity and facilitate a reopening of the economy, which suffered a record slump in 2020.

GRAN CANARIA, Spain (Reuters) - More than 60 North African migrants are living in tents in the mountains of Spain's Gran Canaria island with no access to running water after leaving a Red Cross centre which they say crammed dozens of them into squalid conditions.
About 23,000 migrants made the dangerous Atlantic crossing to the Canary Islands last year, in a near ten-fold surge from 2019. Expecting a further influx, authorities began housing thousands in camps, drawing criticism from rights groups over inhumane conditions.
Perched on a windswept cliff side above the Confital coastline near the city of Las Palmas, the makeshift camp is exposed to the elements and gets freezing cold. 
Every day the group walks 2 km (1 mile) to the San Pedro Church where a local aid organisation, Somos Red, hands out food and water.
One of the men, who did not give his name for fear of repercussions from the authorities, said 50 people were forced to share a tent at a converted military barracks while observing a coronavirus quarantine.
""We won't accept such conditions ... We're asking the European Union to do something because we are suffering here,"" he said, adding that his friends are cold and hungry.
Hiding his face behind a hood, another complained that people were stealing, drinking and smoking hashish in the Red Cross centre. ""I'm a person, not an animal,"" he said.
The men say they were expelled from the centre. The Red Cross says they left of their own accord after objecting to being temporarily transferred to larger tents within the same site.
""We did not ask them to leave. We spoke with all the men involved one by one and encouraged them not to abandon the centre,"" a Red Cross spokesman said.
Asked about the allegations of drug use and petty crime and whether 50 people were housed in one tent, the spokesman said the facilities complied with all sanitary standards. 
A government spokeswoman said the Canaries regional health department had signed off on the centres and coronavirus precautions were adhered to.
San Pedro Parish priest Jorge Hernandez said Somos Red did what it could to support the migrants but criticised the region's immigration policy as inadequate and improvised. 

""They're people ... when you look at their faces, you see their expectations, their hopes, and their frustrations which must be immense ... The pain is very great.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A rumbling political crisis in Belarus spilled over into the Eurovision Song Contest this week, as the country's state broadcaster nominated a band that has released songs mocking protests against President Alexander Lukashenko.
Featuring lyrics such as ""I will teach you to toe the line"", the entry has sparked a backlash from opposition figures and fuelled calls by a European Parliament lawmaker for Belarus to be suspended from the popular competition.
The entry, by Galasy ZMesta, has received 5,800 likes and 40,000 dislikes on the competition's official YouTube page since Tuesday, with more than half a million views.
To critics, allowing the entry to be performed would add legitimacy to a violent crackdown launched by Lukashenko against mass unrest that swept the country following an August election which demonstrators say was rigged to extend his 27-year rule.
The president denies electoral fraud and has accused the West of sponsoring the protests.
Rights groups say more than 33,000 people have been detained in the crackdown, prompting the United Nations human rights chief to warn of a ""human rights crisis"" last month. The government says it is being unfairly maligned.
""This is a mockery of the people of Belarus, of everything that is happening in the country,"" said singer Angelica Agurbash, who represented Belarus at Eurovision in 2005.
""Receiving any representative of Lukashenko's bloodthirsty regime would be wrong,"" she told Reuters.
Galasy ZMesta, a guitar, drums and tambourine band, has been an outspoken critic of the protests and called them an attempt to destroy the country. 
Asked about the number of dislikes on the YouTube video, the band's frontman Dmitry Butakov told Reuters: ""It's normal. People have to show off somehow, and that's what they do.""
He declined further comment about the entry.
KITSCH AND CONTROVERSY
The Eurovision contest, which takes place in Rotterdam this year, is best known for its kitsch-laden entries from around the continent. While its organisers, the European Broadcasting Union, say the event should be free from politics, it has attracted controversy in the past.
""Every song submitted is scrutinised to ensure it complies with the rules of the competition,"" the EBU said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
""The Eurovision Song Contest is a music competition with no political agenda and we will vigorously resist all attempts for this cultural event to be instrumentalised for political ends.""
The EBU last month said it was ""extremely alarmed by the intensifying of attacks on press freedom in Belarus"" after two journalists were jailed for filming protests.
Karin Karlsbro, a Swedish European Parliament member, has joined Belarusian opposition figures in calling for Belarus and its state broadcaster to be excluded from Eurovision.
""The state-owned TV channel is a propaganda megaphone for the dictatorship, for Lukashenko himself,"" she told Reuters.
The state broadcaster did not respond to requests for comment on its selection of song and on calls for its exclusion from Eurovision. 
Galasy ZMesta, which translates as ""Voices of Reason"" or ""Voices from the grassroots"", has singled out opposition figures including Pavel Latushko, a former diplomat, in its songs.
Latushko was fired as head of the Belarusian state theatre last year. Galasy ZMesta mocked him for subsequently fleeing abroad to Poland.
Latushko said the EBU should suspend the Belarusian state broadcaster in solidarity with journalists who were harassed and jailed in the crackdown, just as Belarus was stripped of hosting this year's ice hockey world championships.
""How would Europe applaud a song by the dictatorship now?"" Latushko, who as culture minister used to be involved in selecting Belarusian Eurovision entries, told Reuters.

""Taking it away would cause (Lukashenko) serious psychological damage as well as reputational damage.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's most senior police officer has sought to reassure women it is safe to walk the streets of London at night after one of her officers was arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and murdering a 33-year-old woman.
Sarah Everard's disappearance and the announcement that human remains had been found prompted woman to flood social media with posts about the steps they take when out alone at night to keep safe, including clutching keys to use as a weapon and wearing trainers to help them run.
Others detailed a catalogue of incidents of harassment by men in public over the decades since they were schoolgirls.
""These are so powerful because each and every woman can relate,"" Home Secretary (interior minister) Priti Patel said. ""Every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence.""
Everard was last seen at 9:30 p.m. on March 3 as she walked home from a friend's house in south London. Her image, smiling at the camera or caught on CCTV that evening, has been splashed across British newspapers all week.
An officer, aged in his 40s whose job it was to guard diplomatic buildings, has been arrested on suspicion of murder, kidnap and indecent exposure, while a woman in her 30s has also been detained on suspicion of assisting an offender. 
Cressida Dick, the head of London's police force, said she and her colleagues were ""utterly appalled"" at news a serving officer had been arrested, saying it had sent waves of ""shock and anger"" through the public and the police. 
""I know Londoners will want to know that it is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets,"" she said. 
""But I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public, particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing, will be worried and may well be feeling scared.""
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday he was shocked and deeply saddened by developments while the disappearance prompted #saraheverard to trend online as women relayed their experiences.
""The message that needs to be sent is that male violence is something that has to be tackled and challenged and the justice system and society has to wake up to that,"" said Jess Phillips, the opposition Labour Party's spokeswoman on domestic violence. 
""At the moment we just simply don't take it seriously as we take other crimes.""

A vigil for Everard is due to be held on Saturday night called Reclaim The Streets.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The U.S.-backed Quad alliance aims to invest in India's pharmaceutical capacity as it looks to ramp up COVID vaccine output, but U.S. curbs on exports of key materials could hamper that effort, sources say.
The Quad alliance, grouping the United States, Japan, Australia and India, wants to expand global vaccinations and in turn counter China's growing vaccination diplomacy in Southeast Asia and around the world. India is the world's biggest vaccine maker.
As the alliance's first virtual summit kicks off on Friday, one key assurance that India will be seeking is for an easing of export curbs, said two sources briefed on the matter.
The White House said last week it had used the U.S. Defence Production Act - which prevents export of materials to prioritise local production - to help drugmaker Merck make Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine.
""India's seeking both raw materials and investments from Quad partners and once this aspect is resolved, then the Quad alliance can start large-scale distribution starting in Southeast Asian countries,"" said one Indian government source.
Earlier this week Reuters reported that the United States and Japan would help fund Indian firms manufacturing vaccines for U.S. drugmakers  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc and J&J.
Some of the additional supplies from India will go to Southeast Asia as China pushes its own vaccines to supply Indonesia, Philippines and others in the region.
But the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine maker, has said it is worried the U.S. ban on exports of materials like filters and bags, keeping them for U.S. companies, could limit production, especially of the Novavax shot that it was set to start making next month.
'LOT OF CONCERNS'
""The ramp-up and scaling of Novavax production could take a sharp hit, and if restrictions persist this could down the road also slow the ramp-up of Covishield,"" said a source close to the matter, referring to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine that SII is also licensed to produce.
SII did not respond to a request for comment.
U.S. officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. India's foreign ministry had no immediate comment. 
Limitations to production of the Novavax and Covishield shots risk hurting the GAVI/WHO COVAX initiative that is heavily reliant on those two vaccines as it shares inoculations with poorer countries. 
The World Health Organization has said it also harbours a ""lot of concerns"" over manufacturing, supplies and procurement of vaccines and related materials.
""There's a shortage of materials, of products that you need for the manufacturing of vaccines and for the vials, the glass, the plastic and the stoppers - everything that goes with that,"" WHO's chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, said in a World Bank discussion last week.
""That is where we need global agreement and coordination - not to do export bans, for example, for these raw materials.""
India's Biological E has tied up with J&J to potentially contract-manufacture up to 600 million doses of its vaccine per year. They have signed an initial deal, but production volumes have not been agreed upon.
India makes more than 60% of all vaccines produced globally and its companies have promised to manufacture more than 3 billion doses of COVID shots a year.

The aim of the Quad initiative is to reduce manufacturing backlogs, speed vaccinations and defeat some coronavirus mutations, a senior U.S administration official told Reuters this week.

DUBAI/ANKARA/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Turkey, Russia and Qatar are making a joint attempt to promote a political solution to Syria's 10-year conflict, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Thursday.
""Today we launched a new trilateral consultation process,"" Cavusoglu said after talks in Doha with Russian and Qatari foreign ministers. ""Our goal is to discuss how we can contribute to efforts towards a lasting political solution in Syria.""
All three ministers emphasised in their meeting that the only solution to the conflict, in which hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and millions displaced, was a political settlement in line with United Nations resolutions, he said.
Turkey and Qatar have backed fighters who sought to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Moscow provided military support which helped Assad seize back most of the country.
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the three countries were not seeking to replace efforts which Turkey, Russia and Iran had jointly been making since 2017 to reduce fighting in Syria and discuss a political solution.
""I can only welcome Qatar's desire to make its contribution to creating the conditions for overcoming the current tragic situation in Syria,"" he said.
LESSENING SYRIANS' SUFFERING
Qatari minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said they had also discussed mechanisms for delivering humanitarian aid across the whole of Syria, adding ""there is a crucial need to lessen the suffering of the Syrians.""
He said the reasons for Syria's suspension from the Arab League in 2011 remain, while Cavusoglu said recent international engagement with Assad's government hindered efforts for a political solution by giving it more legitimacy.
In a joint statement after their talks, the ministers urged U.N. agencies and the World Health Organization to prioritise COVID-19 vaccinations inside Syria and to ""enhance"" efforts for delivering humanitarian aid.
They also stressed their commitment to preserving Syria's independence and territorial integrity.

Cavusoglu said Turkey would host the next round of the talks.

HARIDWAR, India (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Hindu devotees plunged into India's Ganges river on Thursday as the country kicked off one of the world's largest religious festivals, even as officials reported the biggest spike in coronavirus cases for three months. 
Hindu ascetics known as Naga sadhus, many naked apart from a coating of ash and carrying swords or tridents, led the bathers at the Kumbh Mela, or pitcher festival, in the northern town of Haridwar. 
All participants at this year's event, that runs until the end of April, are required to present a negative coronavirus test result before being allowed into the festival grounds, authorities said. But there was little evidence of social distancing in place on Thursday as bathers jostled at the riverbank.
Devout Hindus believe bathing in the waters of the Ganges absolves people of sins, and during the Kumbh Mela brings salvation from the cycle of life and death.
""It feels to good to bathe here,"" said 44-year-old Chandubhai Govindbhai Dabhi, after emerging from the waters on Thursday. ""Half the people are wearing masks and half are not, but we are not afraid of corona.""
More than 22,000 people had bathed in the holy river by 8 a.m. (0230 GMT), police overseeing the festival told Reuters partner ANI, a number that was expected to rise significantly throughout the day. 
Authorities said that more than 100 million people attended the festival in 2019, the last time it was held, a figure that most expect will be lower this year. 
After an almost three-month lockdown last year that was one of the world's harshest, India has relaxed almost all restrictions on movement since a peak in cases in September, including reopening vast stadiums for cricket matches, one of the country's national obsessions. 
However, India's COVID-19 cases numbers are again surging, putting it among the top five countries reporting the most daily new infections. 

Officials reported 22,854 new infections on Thursday, the highest in nearly three months, taking the country's total to 11.3 million. Deaths rose by 126 to 158,189, health ministry data showed.

Hong Kong's health bureau told a briefing that a COVID-19 cluster emerged at Ursus Fitness, a gym in the trendy Sai Ying Pun district near the financial centre, which had led to a spike in cases across the city.
At least nine schools have been temporarily closed as a precautionary measure, schools and teachers said on Thursday.
A confirmed case at Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in Hong Kong resulted in a whole floor of staff being sent for tests, with some put into quarantine and many asked to work from home.
The outbreak came as Hong Kong has begun gradually lifting coronavirus restrictions and after authorities permitted gyms and beauty parlours to reopen on Feb. 18 after more than two months of closures. 
Schools had in recent weeks also begun to resume face to face teaching after conducting only online classes since November last year. 
Health authorities reported 22 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Thursday, with around 40 preliminary diagnoses.
Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan of the city's Health Bureau said at least 30 of the preliminary cases were related to the gym cluster. She said some of the customers exercising there had not worn masks, increasing the risk of transmission.

Hong Kong has recorded around 11,000 total coronavirus cases, far lower than other developed cities. The city of 7.5 million people launched its vaccination program against COVID-19 in February but the roll-out has been gradual with only 130,500 receiving their first shot so far.

826,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 06:35AM ET</span>","Analysis: 'Chinese business, Out!' Myanmar anger threatens investment plans","(Reuters) - ""China's gas pipeline will be burned,"" chanted a group of protesters in Myanmar this week on the route of a Chinese pipeline.
Hailed by China as a symbol of ""mutually beneficial cooperation"", the pipeline has become a target for public anger over perceptions Beijing is backing the junta that seized power in a Feb. 1 coup.
The rise in anti-China sentiment has raised questions in Myanmar business circles and in China, not only over the surge of Chinese investment in recent years but for billions of dollars earmarked for a strategic neighbour on Beijing's ""Belt and Road"" infrastructure plan.
""Chinese business, Out! Out!,"" the dozen or so protesters shouted in Mandalay city, a staging point on pipelines across Myanmar from the Indian Ocean to China. Social media carried many more threats.
The gas pipeline, which carries gas from Myanmar's offshore fields, opened in 2013, as Myanmar's military was starting democratic reforms. The $1.5 billion 770-km (480 mile) oil pipe alongside, bringing crude mainly from the Middle East, started in 2017 under the government of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is now detained and facing an array of charges. 
A PetroChina official who declined to be identified said there had been no problems with the operation of the oil pipeline - the only source of crude for the state energy giant’s refinery in Kunming, Yunnan province.
Protests over the pipeline flared after a Myanmar government document leaked from a Feb. 24 meeting showed Chinese officials had asked Myanmar's junta to provide better security - and intelligence on ethnic minority armed groups on the pipeline route.
Reuters was unable to reach officials in Myanmar for comment on the document. 
""Safeguarding the security of bilateral cooperation projects is the common responsibility of both China and Myanmar,"" China's foreign ministry said in response to questions on the document, reiterating its call for ""all sides in Myanmar to exercise calm and restraint"" and to resolve their differences.
""This would also benefit the secure operations of bilateral cooperation projects,"" it said.
China did not immediately respond to a question on anti-China sentiment.
HOSTILE OPINION
Billions of dollars had been earmarked for such projects, including an economic corridor ending at a $1.3 billion deepwater port, industrial zones, a new city next to the commercial hub of Yangon and a railway to the border. 
""Hostile public opinion will inflict long-term threats and damage to China’s plan,"" said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center. 
She pointed in particular to the damage done to Beijing's reputation over the Myitsone Dam project, which was shelved in 2011 amid a local outcry - prompting a concerted effort by China to cultivate the public as well as political leaders.
""Public opinion has been treated as a priority for China’s policy in Myanmar,"" she said.
Efforts in recent years included everything from donating school backpacks to sponsoring inspection trips to China for officials - though a 2018 survey in Myanmar still found an ""explicit bias"" against Chinese investments.
China had also tried to keep close to Suu Kyi, while maintaining ties to the army that overthrew her.
Balancing the relationship has become even more precarious. 
While Western countries have condemned the coup, China has not even described it as one - in line with the generals' wishes. Its call for restraint from both sides draws scorn from opponents of the coup who point to the killing of more than 60 protesters. One policeman has died, the army says. 
""China shame on you. Stop supporting the theft of a nation,"" read one protest placard outside the Chinese embassy before Myanmar security forces cordoned it off.
SUSPICIONS
No matter how outlandish, allegations of Chinese involvement have swirled on social media.
Some said they had seen soldiers with Chinese features or heard some speaking Mandarin. Suspicions were raised by an increase in night-time flights to China - flights the state airline said carried seafood for the Lunar New Year holiday.
Unsubstantiated claims surfaced that the planes were bringing in soldiers or technicians to install an internet firewall - an idea dismissed by the junta and described as ""nonsense"" by the Chinese ambassador.
Concerns that anti-Beijing sentiment could turn on Chinese businesses has prompted some to reconsider their positions - especially as anti-coup protests and strikes strangle the economy.
""They can only vent on the Chinese people on the ground,"" said one Chinese businessman who gave his name as Ran and is now seeking a way out - while saying he had not faced any personal attacks.
Myanmar also has a substantial minority with Chinese origins, whose older members remember anti-Chinese riots in 1967 in which an estimated 30 people were killed. Some younger members, however, have taken a conspicuous stand with the protesters.
""Our elders worry about the Sinophobic posts - things on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) like 'the Chinese will be the first people to be beaten' but it's only a small number of people making them,"" said Aung Aung, 23, a founder of the Young Burmese-Chinese Association. 

""The people know where we stand. We want to get democracy back.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights chief on Thursday urged countries to step up trials in their national courts against suspected war criminals in Syria as the conflict marks its 10th anniversary.
Attempts to refer atrocities in Syria to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague for prosecution have failed, Michelle Bachelet said.
Only one person has been convicted in a foreign court for crimes against humanity or war crimes in a conflict that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives, many of them civilians.
Bachelet also called for increased efforts to trace tens of thousands of missing, whom she said included people held in jails run by government forces across Syria.
Pro-democracy protests against President Bashar al-Assad's authoritarian family rule erupted in March 2011 in southern Syria and were met by a crackdown. But they spread quickly across the country and developed into a multi-sided war that in addition to the numerous casualties has forced more than 11 million from their homes, around half the pre-war population.
Assad's forces, backed by Iran and Russia, have recaptured many areas once held by rebel factions and Islamist militants, but the war grinds on in some corners of Syria.
""We owe it to the victims to ensure the next decade is one of accountability and remedy, with their rights and needs addressed so they can rebuild their lives,"" Bachelet said in a statement.
It is thought that many possible war criminals have relocated overseas. 
A German court sentenced a former member of President Bashar al-Assad's security services to 4-1/2 years in prison last month for abetting the torture of civilians, the first such verdict for crimes against humanity in the Syrian war.
""It remains vital that national courts continue to conduct fair, public and transparent trials and reduce the accountability gap for such serious crimes,"" Bachelet said, calling the conviction ""an important step forward on the path to justice"". 
Assad's government has denied many previous U.N. accusations of war crimes and says it does not torture prisoners.
U.N. panel member Hanny Megally said it had been approached by 60 jurisdictions seeking information and it had provided information in about 300 ongoing cases.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visits prisoners in central prisons in Syria but does not have access to unofficial sites. Its findings are confidential.

""Clearly detention is one of these central issues and every day we try to first, improve the conditions of detention and two, enlarge our access,"" Fabrizio Carboni, ICRC regional director for the Middle East, told Reuters on Tuesday.

MADRID (Reuters) - Despite many sleepless nights on Spain's COVID-19 frontline, Dr Navid Behzadi Koochani of Madrid's regional ambulance service goes to work smiling almost every day. 
Calls to the Madrid service have jumped by a third in the year since the coronavirus struck the world, averaging 4,000 a day, but Behzadi, 48, is proud of his team's ability to swoop in and save lives, and is optimistic the vaccine rollout heralds the end of the pandemic.
""I honestly think it's the best job in the world,"" said the 15-year ambulance service veteran who came to Spain from Iran. 
""When you see that you have been able to be useful, been able in some way to improve the quality of life of a person or save their life, that stays with you forever.""
But he admits it can be tough.
""Nobody likes having someone die in their arms.""
With more than 3 million cases and over 71,000 deaths, Spain has been hit harder than most countries in Europe. But the infection rate has now fallen to its lowest since August. 
""I'm optimistic that in a few months we will be able to take off our masks again, hug each other and have a beer with our friends,"" he said. 
Before transferring a COVID-19 patient between Madrid hospitals, Behzadi's team don head-to-toe protective gear, taping the sleeves of their brilliant white overalls to form an airtight seal with their blue gloves.
Afterwards they hose each other down with disinfectant in a ritual that has become all too familiar since the first wave tore through the Spanish capital a year ago, killing thousands and forcing authorities to turn an ice rink into a morgue.
""Honestly, those were some very bad, very painful days,"" said nurse Sara Diaz Castro, recalling how the team would race from call to call, sometimes arriving too late to help.
The team responds to fewer COVID emergencies now, but they know first-hand how the virus can still tear lives apart. 
MENTAL TOLL
On a recent callout, Behzadi was unable to revive a 35-year-old man who died with COVID-19, leaving behind a young daughter while his wife was in hospital with a severe case.
""These are situations that affect you emotionally... You're there the next day thinking over how fragile life really is and, on the other hand, how lucky we are to be alive.""
Stress on medical personnel is a major concern. A recent study found 45% of Spain's healthcare staff ran a high risk of some type of mental disorder after the first wave, including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Frontline (NYSE:FRO) medics like the Madrid ambulance crews have been found to suffer more than other health professionals.
Morale on the team is good, nurse Diaz says, although they are all tired after a year of fighting the virus. 
Like many in her profession she has not been able to meet her elderly parents indoors for over a year and she longs to return to how things were before. 
""I want to go out with my friends, I want to go to work and not have to wear protection. I want to see patients without a mask."" 
After finishing a 24-hour shift, she takes time to decompress and play with her kids or go for a run. The virus has made her stronger and more appreciative of what she has. 

""You have to enjoy every little moment you have in life because you don't know what might happen to you.""

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's parliament approved on Thursday a draft decision to change Hong Kong's electoral system, further reducing democratic representation in the city's institutions and introducing a mechanism to vet politicians' loyalty to Beijing.
The measures are part of Beijing's efforts to consolidate its increasingly authoritarian grip over the global financial hub following the imposition of a national security law in June, which critics see as a tool to crush dissent.
Beijing is responding to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2019, which it saw as a threat to China's national security. Since then, most high-profile democratic politicians and activists have been sent to jail or are in self-exile.
""The central authorities have good intentions,"" the Liaison Office, Beijing's representative body in Hong Kong, said in a statement.
""We expect all sectors of the community and the general public to take ownership of the work to amend the law and offer suggestions, so that a strong positive energy can be gathered under the banner of patriotism and love for Hong Kong."" 
The legislators gathered in the Great Hall of the People burst into sustained applause when the 2,895 to 0 vote tally, with one abstention, was projected onto screens.
In a separate statement, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam pledged her ""staunch support"" and expressed ""sincere gratitude."" 
The restructuring is aimed at getting the city ""back on the right track,"" Lam said.
The changes virtually eliminate any possibility of the opposition affecting the outcome of elections in the former British colony, whose return to Chinese rule in 1997 came with a promise of a high degree of autonomy.
The blanket requirement for ""patriotism"" raises the risk that politicians will start competing over who is more loyal to Beijing, rather than who has the better ideas for how the city should be governed, analysts say.
The head of Hong Kong's legislature, the secretaries for justice and security, the customs department, the immigration office, the correctional services department, the police chief and the fire service all issued separate statements praising China's moves.
Hong Kong Secretary for Mainland and Constitutional Affairs Erick Tsang has defined patriotism as ""holistic love"" for China, including the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.
British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Thursday that proposed changes to Hong Kong's electoral system would further undermine international trust in China.
""This is the latest step by Beijing to hollow out the space for democratic debate in Hong Kong,"" Raab said.
The draft decision said the move will help ""develop a democratic system in line with Hong Kong's actual situation"" and protect residents' ""rights to vote and be voted,"" according to state news agency Xinhua.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters the purpose of the changes was to ""adhere to and improve"" the one country, two systems principle agreed for Hong Kong at the handover. 
VETTING AND SCREENING
The measures will alter the size and composition of Hong Kong's legislature and an electoral committee selecting the chief executive in favour of pro-Beijing figures.
The committee will also be given powers to select many city legislators. A new mechanism will be set up to vet candidates and screen election winners' behaviour to make sure only those seen as patriots rule Hong Kong.
Beijing will increase the size of the electoral committee from 1,200 to 1,500, and the legislature from 70 to 90 seats.
Currently half of the 70 seats in the Legislative Council, known as LegCo, are directly elected, a proportion which will shrink with the extra seats picked by the electoral committee. The other half represents industries, unions, and professions and is largely stacked with pro-Beijing figures.
Beijing had promised universal suffrage as an ultimate goal for Hong Kong in its mini-constitution, the Basic Law.
Critics say the changes to the electoral system move Hong Kong in the opposite direction, leaving the democratic opposition with the most limited space it has ever had since the 1997 handover, if any at all.
It is not clear what shape any future opposition could take and how its message could comply with loyalty requirements.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Thursday the government was declaring war on property crime amid widening accusations of insider speculation by dozens of employees of the state housing corporation.
The growing scandal has sparked outrage in South Korea as property prices in and around the capital Seoul have soared, making affordable housing hard to find.
Chung said after an initial probe at least 20 employees of the Korea Land and Housing Corp. were suspected of trying to use classified knowledge to buy undeveloped land just before new development projects were slated to begin in those areas.
""The government will never forgive the crimes of the public corporation and the public servants who filled their pockets by exploiting the people's dreams and hope,"" Chung told a briefing
He said it would be up to the government to restore public trust, and that the initial probe was just the beginning of a wider investigation and effort to punish anyone found guilty.
""The government hereby declares war on property crime,"" Chung said.
An investigative parliamentary committee established by the opposition People Power Party identified at least 74 additional Korea Land and Housing Corp employees suspected of property speculation, beyond the initial 13 named this week, according to documents provided to Reuters by lawmaker Kwak Sang-do.
Those employees had conducted 64 suspicious land deals since 2018, the documents said, and Kwak's office said the committee planned to expand its probe to include transportation ministry workers as well.
Noh Woong-rae, a member of the ruling Democratic Party, said further investigation was needed to determine fact from fiction amid so many allegations of wrongdoing, but he said Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport Byeon Chang-heum should consider stepping down.
Byeon served as head of the Korea Land and Housing Corporation from April 2019 until December 2020, when he was nominated as minister.
Byeon - who is not among the employees named - has apologised for the scandal and said he would cooperate with investigators. The current executive vice president has also apologised and pledged to cooperate.

The property speculation scandal comes a month before a by-election that will decide several key offices, including the mayors of the country's two largest cities, Seoul and Busan.

The medical board will also review an additional 42 previously closed sexual assault cases to determine if doctors who might have had knowledge of sexual misconduct failed to report it to the authorities, the Ohio Department of Public Safety said in its 173-page report.
The taskforce that produced the report was created by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine in 2019 in response to a sex-abuse scandal that involved Richard Strauss, a former team doctor at Ohio State University.
Nearly 180 men who attended Ohio State University claimed they were sexually abused more than two decades ago by the now-deceased doctor, and university staff who knew of the abuse failed to act, a report released by the school in May 2019 had said. (https://reut.rs/3bC8d9E)
""The Medical Board has made real and meaningful strides toward ensuring that never again would it fail to act when it holds credible, actionable information about one of its licensees, such as it had with Strauss,"" Wednesday's report said.
The taskforce had identified 1,254 closed sexual impropriety cases going back 25 years and ultimately decided to treat 91 of those as active cases. The news was first reported by The Columbus Dispatch.

IWAKI, Japan (Reuters) - With a moment of silence, prayers and anti-nuclear protests, Japan on Thursday mourned about 20,000 victims of the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan 10 years ago, destroying towns and triggering nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima.
Huge waves triggered by the 9.0-magnitude quake - one of the strongest on record - crashed into the northeastern coast, crippling the Fukushima Dai-ichi power plant and forcing more than 160,000 residents to flee as radiation spewed into the air.
The world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl and the tremor have left survivors struggling to overcome the grief of losing families and towns to the waves in a few frightening hours on the afternoon of March 11, 2011.
About 50 kilometres (31 miles) south from the plant, in the gritty coastal city of Iwaki, which has since become a hub for labourers working on nuclear decommissioning, restaurant owner Atsushi Niizuma prayed to his mother killed by the waves.
""I want to tell my mother that my children, who were all close to her, are doing well. I came here to thank her that our family is living safely,"" said Niizuma, 47.
Before setting off for work, he quietly paid his respects at a stone monument at a seaside shrine with carvings of his mother's name, Mitsuko, and 65 others who died in the disaster.
On the day of the earthquake, Mitsuko was looking after his children. The children rushed into a car but Mitsuko was swept away by the waves as she returned to the house to grab her belongings. It took a month to recover her body, Niizuma said.
The Akiba shrine has become a symbol of resilience for the survivors, as it was barely damaged by the tsunami while houses nearby were swept away or burned down.
About two dozen residents gathered with Niizuma to decorate it with paper cranes, flowers and yellow handkerchiefs with messages of hope sent by students from across the country.
""It was sleeting 10 years ago, and it was cold. The coldness always brought me back to the memory of what happened on the day,"" said Hiroko Ishikawa, 62.
""But with my back soaking up the sun today, we are feeling more relaxed. It's as if the sun is telling us that 'It's okay, why don't you go talk with everyone who came back to visit their hometown?'""
REMEMBERING THE DEAD
At 2:46 p.m., exact moment the earthquake struck a decade ago, Emperor Naruhito and his wife led a moment of silence to honour the dead in a commemorative ceremony in Tokyo. Silent prayers were held across the country.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told the memorial ceremony that the loss of life was still impossible to contemplate. 
""It is unbearable when I think of the feelings of all those who lost their loved ones and friends,"" said Suga, dressed in a black suit. 
At the ceremony attended by emperor and prime minister, the attendees wore masks and kept their distance, and did not sing along with the national anthem to prevent the spread of coronavirus. 
""I would like to express condolences from the bottom of my heart to everybody who suffered from the effects of the disaster,"" Suga added, reaffirming support for those affected by the disaster.
The government has spent about $300 billion (32.1 trillion yen) to rebuild the region, but areas around the Fukushima plant remain off-limits, worries about radiation levels linger and many who left have settled elsewhere. Decommissioning of the crippled plant will take decades and billions of dollars.
Some 40,000 people are still displaced by the disaster.
Japan is again debating the role of nuclear power in its energy mix as the resource-poor country aims to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2050 to fight global warming. But an NHK public TV survey showed 85% of the public worries about nuclear accidents.
The work to decommission the wrecked Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, deal with contaminated water and solid waste, and make the area safe is immense. 
About 5,000 workers pass through gates into the crippled plant each day to pull apart the plant, which still has about 880 tonnes of melted fuel debris in its reactors. 
The operator of the plant, Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO), has estimated the project would take decades, while critics say it could take up to a century to return the plant to a usable state.
The mass demonstrations against nuclear power seen in the wake of 3/11 have faded, but distrust lingers. Some antinuclear activists are planning demonstrations in front of TEPCO for Thursday night.
Only nine of Japan's 33 remaining commercial reactors have been approved for restarts under post-Fukushima safety standards and only four are operating, compared with 54 before the disaster.

Nuclear power supplied just 6% of Japan's energy needs in the first half of 2020 compared with 23.1% for renewable sources - far behind Germany's 46.3% - and nearly 70% for fossil fuels.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's High Court released on bail on Thursday one activist charged with conspiracy to commit subversion but remanded another in a widely monitored case that saw the most sweeping use yet of the city's national security law.
The High Court was ruling on an appeal by prosecutors against a lower court's decision to grant bail to the activists. 
Foreign diplomats and rights groups are closely watching proceedings as concerns mount over the vanishing space for dissent in the former British colony, which has taken a swift authoritarian turn since the imposition of the law in June 2020.
The case offers an insight into how the security law drafted by Beijing clashes with the global financial hub's common-law traditions, and could see activists held in custody for months until their trial begins. 
In contrast with past practice, the new security law puts the onus on defendants to prove they will not pose a security threat if released on bail.
A lower court granted 15 activists bail last week after marathon hearings of 47 opposition figures, which stretched into the night for four consecutive days and saw some of the defendants falling ill and hospitalized. 
Prosecutors appealed the bail decisions, however, preventing the activists' immediate release. Four were released last Friday after prosecutors withdrew appeals.
Former opposition lawmaker Helena Wong was released on bail on Thursday as the High Court rejected the appeal. Community-level democratic politician Ng Kin-wai was remanded in custody. The court will publish its reasons later.
Nine others are set to appear in court in two batches on Saturday and Monday. 
The conditions for Wong's bail included not threatening national security, participating in any elections, or contacting foreign officials, as well as surrendering all travel documents, observing a curfew and reporting to police regularly. 
Of the 32 for whom bail was denied, about two dozen are appealing the decision, with hearings starting on Friday.
The 47 activists are accused of organising and participating in an unofficial, non-binding primary poll in July 2020 that authorities said was part of a ""vicious plot"" to ""overthrow"" the government.
The vote was aimed at selecting the strongest opposition candidates for a legislative council election that the government later postponed, citing the coronavirus.
The detentions have been fiercely criticised by governments in the West, including in Britain and the United States.
Hong Kong's Department of Justice has said no one should interfere with independent prosecutorial decisions, as it would undermine the rule of law. 
Supporters of the security law, which punishes what it broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, say it is necessary to restore stability in Hong Kong after months of pro-democracy protests in 2019.

Hong Kong laws restrict media coverage of the content of bail hearings.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A year ago, Singaporean Chiya Amos was living his dream of leading orchestras around Russia as an aspiring classical conductor working with ballets and operas.
Since January, he has been working 12-hour days pedalling around Singapore on a bicycle, braving its heat and humidity to deliver meals, drinks and snacks. 
The coronavirus pandemic put the brakes on Amos' career, with his regular gigs halted as infections soared in Russia. After 10 months without work, he returned to Singapore to ride out the pandemic in a comparative safe haven. 
But there was no music work for him here either. 
   ""Many of us musicians are still out of a job, we are sort of displaced,"" said Chiya, as he prefers to be known. ""I've applied for more than 40 jobs since last January, but I haven't heard from most of them."" 
Although restrictions are gradually easing in Russia, there is less work for foreign conductors, the 30-year-old said.
    In the meantime, he listens to symphonic orchestra pieces on his headset while cycling between destinations, making an average 30 deliveries a day.
Although Chiya earns a similar income as before, he works for much longer, with a greater physical toll. 
Between shifts, he studies music, such as Verdi operas and speaks daily by video call to his Russian wife, who was unable to stay with him in Singapore. 
""I miss being on stage. Of course, I miss collaborating with people, I miss waving my hands and making magic music,"" he said.
He says the jobs have some similarities. 
""We bring food to people, we bring sustenance to people. And as a conductor, we work with orchestras to bring sustenance to the soul and the mind."" 
    Chiya hopes more venues will reopen as more people are given coronavirus vaccinations globally. He has one booking already for Tokyo's Spring Festival in April. 
    He feels his experience has helped him mature. 

""I conduct a lot of Verdi,"" he said. ""There's a lot of tragedy in it, and I think this experience sort of hardens me and I'm able to express my emotions better. I feel like I've matured a few years, even though it's only been a year.""

KABUL (Reuters) - At his farm in Afghanistan's capital Kabul, Rasool Rezaie gently picks oyster mushrooms, part of the around 30 kg he sells in markets daily.
Rezaie learned how to grow mushrooms during a stay in Russia as he tried to claim asylum there, and set up his farm two years ago.
    ""I was introduced to a mushroom farm in Russia by a friend, and I started working there, where I learned how to produce the mushroom spores and cultivate them,"" said Rezaie, who first moved to Russia in 2012 due to insecurity and unemployment in Afghanistan. 
    In 2016 more than one million people, a quarter of them Afghans, applied for asylum in Europe.
Rezaie applied in Russia but his claim was rejected and he returned to Afghanistan, where he initially worked as a shopkeeper. But the memory of mushroom farming lingered.
    ""I said to myself 'when I have experience of this profession, why shouldn't I do it?'"" he told Reuters.
He began by growing mushrooms in a single room in his own house, producing 4-5 kg for markets. Today, Rezaie said he earns about 4,500 Afghanis ($58) a day and is optimistic about his future.
He has even begun supplying spores to others looking to set up their own mushroom farms, a rare example of domestic farming in landlocked Afghanistan where seeds are usually imported.
Rezaie said mushroom-growing picked up during the coronavirus pandemic, with people looking for a new source of income as businesses shuttered.
Zakir Hussain Mohammadi, a vendor who sells about 10 kg of mushrooms daily at a local Kabul market, said interest from consumers was also on the rise.  

    Rezaie hopes other farmers too will grow mushrooms and change the image of Afghanistan as a global producer of opium.

The rights group said it had verified more than 50 videos from the crackdown, in which the United Nations says security forces have killed at least 60 protesters. It said many killings documented amounted to extrajudicial executions.
Reuters was unable to reach a junta spokesman for comment. The army has said its response to protests has been restrained.
The junta took power on Feb. 1, detaining elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and prompting daily protests across Myanmar that have at times drawn hundreds of thousands of people on to the streets.
Amnesty accused the army of using weapons suitable for the battlefield to kill protesters. It said they were in the hands of units accused by rights groups of years of atrocities against minority ethnic groups, including Rohingya Muslims.
""These are not the actions of overwhelmed, individual officers making poor decisions,"" said Joanne Mariner, Director of Crisis Response at Amnesty International. 
""These are unrepentant commanders already implicated in crimes against humanity, deploying their troops and murderous methods in the open.""
Amnesty said weapons used included sniper rifles and light machine guns, as well as assault rifles and sub-machine guns.
It called for a stop to the killings and for the release of detainees. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners says nearly 2,000 people have been detained since the coup.

In justifying its takeover, the army cited alleged fraud in a November election that Suu Kyi's party had won. Its accusations had been dismissed by the electoral commission.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's lower house of Congress on Wednesday approved a bill that would decriminalize cannabis for recreational, medical and scientific uses, bringing it a step closer to creating one of the world's largest markets for the plant. 
Backed by the administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the bill marks a major shift in a country bedeviled for years by violence between feuding drug cartels.
Lawmakers approved the bill in general with 316 votes in favor and 127 against. Now, the Senate needs to review and approve the bill.
If passed, the law would create a huge market, which foreign companies are eager to tap.
The bill would allow five types of licenses for the cultivation, transformation, sale, research and export or import of marijuana. Only people 18 years and older, and with a permit, would be able to grow, carry or consume marijuana and its derivatives.
""Today we are making history,"" said Simey Olvera, a lawmaker from Lopez Obrador's ruling Morena party who was wearing a mask with marijuana leaves printed on it.
""With this, the false belief that cannabis forms part of Mexico's serious health problems is left behind.""
Lopez Obrador, whose ruling Morena party has a majority in both chambers of Congress, has argued that decriminalizing cannabis and other narcotics could help combat Mexico's powerful drug cartels.
In late 2013, Uruguay became the first country in the world to legalize the production and sale of marijuana in modern times. Other countries in the region, such as Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Peru, allow its medical use.

In 2018, Canada also legalized marijuana, including recreational use, with several large U.S. states also regulating its legal use.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday blacklisted two Islamist extremist groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mozambique as foreign terrorist organizations over accusations of links to Islamic State (ISIS).
The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in Congo and its leader Seka Musa Baluku and Mozambique's Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama and its leader Abu Yasir Hassan were also named ""specially designated global terrorists.""
The designations prevent travel by members to the United States, freeze any U.S.-related assets, ban Americans from doing business with them and make it a crime to provide support or resources to the movements.
The United States dubbed the groups ISIS-DRC and ISIS-Mozambique.
""The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) announced the launch of the Islamic State Central Africa Province (ISCAP) in April 2019 to promote the presence of ISIS associated elements within Central, East, and Southern Africa,"" the State Department said in a statement.  
""Although ISIS-associated media portray ISCAP as a unified structure, ISIS-DRC and ISIS-Mozambique are distinct groups with distinct origins,"" it said. ""These groups have committed or pose a significant risk of committing acts of terrorism.""
The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan insurgent faction active in eastern Congo since the 1990s, has committed a spate of brutal reprisal attacks on civilians since the army began operations against it in late 2019.
The ADF has been blamed for the killing of over 140 people since the start of the year, in almost weekly attacks in Congo’s restive east. The group killed around 850 people last year, according to U.N. figures.
Islamic State funding and recognition has driven the ADF into a new phase of deadly expansion, said Laren Poole from the Bridgeway Foundation, a U.S. based thinktank. 
""We believe that targeting the group's financial and recruitment networks will provide the most effective way to reduce the Islamic State in DRC's capacity for violence,"" Poole told Reuters.
Some analysts, though, have questioned links between the ADF and Islamic State. 
""These new sanctions probably won't have much effect on the ground, just as the sanctions on ADF in 2014 changed nothing,"" said Dan Fahey, a former member of an independent group of experts charged with monitoring U.N. sanctions on DRC.
""It is a symbolic act, and a bit surprising because the group of experts has consistently downplayed the nature and strength of the ISIS influence in Congo,"" he added. 
Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama, known in Mozambique as Al-Shabaab, staged its first attack in 2017. First known mainly for beheadings, the fighters declared allegiance to Islamic State in 2019 and have since increased attacks in scale and frequency.

(Reuters) - Hussy, mistress, whore, evil woman - these are just some of the nine example compound words that artist Ika Vantiani was shocked to find listed under the entry for 'woman' or 'perempuan' in Indonesia's official dictionary.
All nine were sexualised or derogatory terms. In contrast, in the entry for 'laki-laki', one of the words for man, there is just one example, 'laki-laki jemputan', which means a 'man chosen as a son-in-law'. Another word for man, 'pria' also lists one term: 'pria idaman' meaning 'heartthrob'.
Since making this discovery in 2016, Ika has campaigned through her art for change and as part of that she has assiduously collected editions of the Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia, which is compiled by a government agency and is the standard dictionary used in schools and by teachers.
""Perempuan jalang, this one actually means slut. That is the one word that keeps popping up in every edition,"" she told Reuters.
""The focus is on examples that include words like pelacur or jalang - meaning whore, a woman who loves to sell herself, nasty women, mistress.""
Last November, the Oxford University Press said it would change the entries for 'woman' in its dictionaries to include more positive and active descriptions and Ika is hoping for a similar result.
The campaign has drawn attention to what critics say is a patriarchal culture in the world's biggest Muslim majority country. Ika has also gained the support of Indonesia's National Commission on Violence against Women which this year called for a revision. 
Language, the commission said, ""played an important role in building the values of gender equality and the elimination of violence against women"".
Ika and her male colleague, Yolando Zelkeos Siahaya, have highlighted the issue in a series of workshops and exhibitions, including one at the Indonesian national gallery in 2018.
One work featured clear sheets of acrylic with the dictionary entry for 'perempuan' printed across them so that viewers could imagine being referred to in that way.
""Most people when they see this work of mine, they are shocked,"" said Ika. ""They say: 'I never would have thought that is how the word 'woman' is defined in our dictionary.'""
Last month her work, which include t-shirts that call for change to the entry and were worn at a women’s march in 2020, provoked a response from Badan Bahasa, the agency responsible for the dictionary.
The use of the terms, it said, was based on data showing they were among the most frequently used in tandem with 'perempuan'.
""As for the social picture that emerges from the presentation of information in the dictionary not being ideal, that is another discussion,"" it said in a statement posted on its website.
The response perplexes University of Indonesia linguist Nazarudin, who says Indonesian language data from 2013 collected by Leipzig University shows other phrases, such as women's empowerment or women's rights, were far more frequently used. 
""The question is, what kind of data did they have?"" he asked, ""How can it be so negative?""
A Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search shows there are 98 million entries for 'hak perempuan' meaning women's rights compared to just 481,000 entries for perempuan jalang, the word for 'slut'. 
Badan Bahasa told Reuters that in addition to the Leipzig data, it also referred to the Malay Concordance Project, a corpus of classical Malay texts. 
Ika says she is hopeful of change.

""I am not saying I want it all to be changed into positive words,"" she said, ""No. But I want objectivity and real conversations.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on two children of Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing and six companies they control in response to the military's Feb. 1 coup and the killing of protesters since the takeover.
The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement it blacklisted Aung Pyae Sone and Khin Thiri Thet Mon, the adult children of Myanmar's commander in chief who led the coup and installed himself as head of the ruling State Administration Council.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned more punitive actions could follow, and condemned the detention of over 1,700 people and attacks by Myanmar's security forces against unarmed protesters that he said have killed at least 53 people.
""We will not hesitate to take further action against those who instigate violence and suppress the will of the people,"" Blinken said in a statement.
The military has brushed off condemnation of its actions, as it has in past periods of army rule when outbreaks of protest were forcibly repressed.
Wednesday's move - the latest in a series of punitive actions taken by Washington against Myanmar's military over the coup - essentially freezes any U.S. assets of those blacklisted and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.
Campaign group Justice for Myanmar said in January that Min Aung Hlaing, who has been commander in chief since 2011, has ""abused his power to benefit his family, who have profited from their access to state resources and the military's total impunity."" 
The six Myanmar companies blacklisted by Washington include A&M Mahar, which is controlled by Aung Pyae Sone, the general's son. Justice for Myanmar said A&M offers foreign pharmaceutical companies access to Myanmar's market by obtaining approvals from Myanmar's Food and Drug Administration. 
John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, praised the Treasury's move for directly hitting at the wealth of Min Aung Hlaing, but called for stronger action.
""These are not the kind of punitive actions that we believe will lead to behavioral change. We are recommending they focus on ongoing revenue streams which are far larger and if cut off would be far more painful to the military as an institution,” Sifton said, referring to oil and gas revenues produced by projects that involve international companies.

The United States has so far held back from imposing sanctions against military conglomerates Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL), among those used by the military to control vast swathes of the country's economy.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 05:11PM ET</span>",Capturing the moment a U.S. border patrol agent reaches out to a young migrant,"(Reuters) - Lying patiently in the long grass near the Rio Grande in Texas on Tuesday, Reuters photographer Adrees Latif was watching and waiting.
A native Texan, Latif has been covering the ebbs and flows of the migration story at the border since 2018. In recent weeks, a humanitarian crisis in Central America paired with changes in migration strategy in the White House have led to a surge in those trying to cross north to what they hope will be a better life in the United States.
Within the heavily trafficked Rio Grande Valley sector of the border, Latif has seen the people smugglers move their operations around to evade the border patrol in the last three years, shifting just like the wide river that divides the United States and Mexico.
To get the pictures he is looking for, Latif needs to be on site from dusk to dawn, waiting to catch the moment once or twice a day when a vehicle will appear on the Mexican side to transport migrants to a waiting raft. Within five minutes, they are across the river and into Texas.
He does not want to miss that moment.
""It's like a whole day's work lying in wait and then you only have a few moments to produce the images,"" said Latif.
On Tuesday, Latif saw a scout on the Mexican side, just as a border patrol helicopter passed overhead. It hovered over Latif, kicking up dust. The smugglers likely saw that and chose to cross further upriver.
Moving to where he thought the migrants would disembark, the helicopter still overhead, Latif saw a migrant couple walking through the brush. It's uneven territory, heavy with Lyme disease-carrying ticks, and he advised them to use the road.
They told him others were hiding further back. He headed in that direction, as agents began arriving. Suddenly, he came across the scene captured in the photograph. A Texas state trooper, dressed head to toe in green and clutching handcuffs in one hand, was beckoning to a migrant family to come out of the brush.
In the photo, four-year-old Harbin Ordonez, who traveled from Honduras with his mother, looks at the man, while his mother, Edith, holds on to him tight. The boy was crying just a moment before and will later cry again but in this moment he stares, fear and defiance mixing on his young face. The sound of the helicopter is so loud, it is impossible to hear conversation.
A minute or so later, the trooper accompanied the two and another migrant mother and child to pick-up trucks, where they were driven up to the border wall, about two miles away. There, about a dozen migrants followed the usual routine - showed identification, removed jewelry and shoelaces, and had the bands the smugglers used to identify them clipped off their wrists.

They were then taken away in buses - family groups on one bus, unaccompanied minors on another - to whatever future awaits them in the United States.

Corey Hurren, 46, pleaded guilty last month to eight charges related to the July incident at the Ottawa estate that includes the prime minister's residence, Rideau Cottage. The most serious charges were for possession of illegal firearms.
Ontario Court Justice Robert Wadden gave Hurren a six-year prison sentence with a credit for one year of time served, and banned him from owning firearms for life, according to the hearing, which was broadcast online.
""He has not expressed remorse for his actions,"" Wadden said.
Hurren, who had two handguns, two shotguns and a semi-automatic rifle, rammed a gate to the 88-acre (0.35 square km) estate where the prime minister lives with his family, and then proceeded on foot toward the residence.
Trudeau and his family were not at home. After a 90-minute standoff, police convinced Hurren to surrender.
Hurren, a master corporal in an army reserve unit that serves in remote areas of the country, had driven more than 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) from his home in the province of Manitoba to confront Trudeau because he was angry over COVID-19 restrictions and a federal ban on assault-style firearms. 
""This was an armed aggression against the government, which must be denounced in the strongest terms,"" Wadden said.
The sentencing was in line with the request from the Crown prosecutor, and double that sought by Michael Davies, Hurren's lawyer.

When he abandoned his truck, Hurren left a note saying he hoped his actions would be a ""wake up call and a turning point"" for the country.

By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland expects to get 1 million vaccine doses from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) this month, a senior Federal Health Ministry vaccine official said on Tuesday, after receiving some 1.1 million in January and February. 
""We have steadily rising delivery volumes every month, and we expect that will help us reach our targets,"" Nora Kronig, who heads the health ministry's vaccine logistics effort, adding 900,000 people have so far had their first shot and 320,000 a second booster.
The planned March deliveries exceed initial expectations, and Kronig said they'll be sufficient to make up for slightly lower volumes that arrived last month. 
Switzerland expects to vaccinate all of its 8.6 million residents who want a COVID-19 shot by summer, and Kronig's latest comments suggest the nation is on track, especially with potential approvals of new vaccines in coming weeks. Mass vaccinations beyond older people are due to begin in the second quarter.
New infections reported on Tuesday totaled 1,378 cases, well below the 10,000-plus record from Nov. 2. Another 13 deaths were reported. 
Even so, cases have slightly risen since mid-February, driven by accelerating infections with new variants of the virus, leaving the pandemic's trajectory in coming weeks uncertain, a scientist on Switzerland's COVID-19 task force said. 
Task force member Martin Ackermann, a biologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, urged more testing, continued hygiene measures -- and aggressive vaccinations as more shots arrive.

""At this time, the number of people who have gotten shots is still too small to have a significant influence on new infections,"" Ackermann said. ""Speeding up the pace will pay off, once more shots become available.""

Kan also said Netanyahu may meet Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman there. It said he would hold talks with Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan and that the Saudi crown prince might join them.
The report was not immediately confirmed by Netanyahu's office or by the UAE. A Saudi official source denied the report and told Reuters that Prince Mohammed would not be visiting the UAE on Thursday and would not be meeting Netanyahu.
Israel’s Channel 12 TV said Netanyahu would spend two hours in the UAE, entirely at an Abu Dhabi airport.
Israel established formal relations with the UAE and Bahrain last September - only its third and fourth normalisation deals with Arab states in over 70 years - as part of a U.S.-brokered agreement. The three countries share common concerns about Iran.
Saudi Arabia, a Gulf powerhouse and Islam's birthplace, encouraged the rapprochement but stopped short of recognising Israel itself. In November, Israeli officials and sources familiar with the matter said Netanyahu and Prince Mohammed met covertly in the kingdom but Riyadh publicly denied the meeting. 
It was not immediately clear if Netanyahu, on what Israeli media said would be a one-day visit, would also go to Bahrain, as he had planned to do during a previously scheduled one-day trip to the Gulf in February which he postponed due to the coronavirus crisis. 
Netanyahu, running in politically polarised Israel's fourth election in two years largely on his role in its rapid COVID-19 vaccination programme, has also made his drive to forge new relations in the Gulf region a centrepiece of his campaign.
Israeli tourists and business executives flocked to the UAE before a national lockdown in Israel largely closed its main international airport, in Tel Aviv, in late January. Restrictions were eased on Sunday.
In an interview with Israeli Army Radio on Tuesday, Netanyahu called on voters to re-elect him on March 23 so that he could achieve ""more peace agreements"" in the area, while ensuring that Iran ""doesn't arm itself with nuclear weapons"".

Iran denies its nuclear programme is aimed at developing atomic weaponry.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Syria is a ""living nightmare"" where about half the children have never lived a day without war and 60 percent of Syrians are at risk of going hungry, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday to mark the 10th anniversary of the conflict. 
""It is impossible to fully fathom the extent of the devastation in Syria, but its people have endured some of the greatest crimes the world has witnessed this century. The scale of the atrocities shocks the conscience,"" Guterres said.
""Syria has fallen off the front page. And yet, the situation remains a living nightmare,"" he told reporters.
A crackdown by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 led to civil war, with Moscow backing Assad and Washington supporting the opposition. Millions of people have fled Syria and millions are internally displaced.
""More humanitarian access is needed,"" Guterres told reporters on Wednesday. ""Intensified cross-line and cross-border deliveries are essential to reach everyone in need everywhere. This is why I have repeatedly urged the Security Council to achieve consensus on this crucial matter.""
The 15-member Security Council first authorized a cross-border aid operation into Syria in 2014 at four points. Last year, it reduced that access to one crossing point from Turkey due to opposition from Russia and China over renewing all four. 
The council is due to address the issue of cross-border aid again in July.

Throughout the past decade, the Security Council has been divided over how to handle Syria, with Syrian ally Russia and China pitted against Western members. Russia has vetoed 16 council resolutions related to Syria and was backed by China for many of those votes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet with top Chinese officials on March 18 in Alaska, the White House said on Wednesday, the first high-level in-person contact between the two sparring countries under the Biden administration. 
The meeting, taking place on Blinken's return from his first overseas trip to key U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, will come amid what is shaping up to be a major U.S. diplomatic push to solidify alliances in Asia and Europe to counter China. 
National security adviser Jake Sullivan will join the meeting in Anchorage with China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and State Councillor Wang Yi, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, adding that the administration would approach its relations with China ""in lockstep"" with its partners.
""It was important to us that this administration's first meeting with Chinese officials be held on American soil, and occur after we have met and consulted closely with partners and allies in both Asia and Europe,"" Psaki told a news briefing.
She said the meeting would be ""an opportunity to address a wide range of issues, including ones where we have deep disagreements.""
China's embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
President Joe Biden's administration has committed to reviewing elements of U.S. policies toward China, as the world's two largest economies navigate frosty relations that sank to their lowest depths in decades during Donald Trump's presidency. 
Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, held their first phone call as leaders last month and appeared at odds on most issues, even as Xi warned that confrontation would be a ""disaster"" for both nations.
Testifying before the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday, Blinken signaled next week's meeting would not be a return to regular senior-level dialogues used under past U.S. administrations, which had been increasingly criticized in Washington for yielding little progress on U.S. grievances with Beijing. 
""There's no intent at this point for a series of follow-on engagements. Those engagements, if they are to follow, really have to be based on the proposition that we're seeing tangible progress and tangible outcomes on the issues of concern to us with China,"" Blinken said.
U.S. DIPLOMATIC PUSH
Blinken also said that if China insists it is not violating the human rights of Uighur Muslims in its Xinjiang region, it should provide the world access to the area.
U.N. experts and rights groups say China has detained more than a million Uighurs and other minorities there, actions the United States has deemed a genocide. Beijing denies abuses, saying facilities in the region are for vocational training to counter the threat of terrorism. 
The talks will follow the visit by Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Japan and South Korea next week, as well as an online summit on Friday between Biden and the leaders of Japan, India and Australia. 
That will be the first leader-level meeting of the four-country group, known as the Quad, seen as part of U.S. efforts to boost its diplomacy in Asia to balance China's growing military and economic power. 
Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the timing of the meeting sends the message to Beijing that U.S. alliances are strong. 
Discussions are likely to focus on China's policies toward Hong Kong, its pressure on Taiwan, its treatment of Uighurs, and what Washington sees as economic coercion against Australia, she said.

""If the Chinese repeat their messages contained in recent speeches that the U.S. is to blame for the problems in the U.S.-China relationship and therefore the ball is in the U.S. court, then nothing positive will come of this meeting,"" Glaser said.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentines will take to the streets on Wednesday to demand what they say is justice for Diego Maradona after the soccer icon's death in November sparked investigations into how he died and whether there had been any negligence in his care.
""He did not die, they killed him!,"" the organizers of the demonstration said in materials sent out on social media. ""Justice for Diego. Trial and punishment of the guilty.""
The march will begin at 18:00 local time (2100 GMT) at the emblematic Obelisco monument in central Buenos Aires.
Maradona, a World Cup winner with Argentina who is regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all time, attained almost godlike status in his home country despite long battles with drug and alcohol addiction and poor health.
A medical board, at the request of the justice department, met on Monday to analyze Maradona's death. The idol, who won the 1986 World Cup, had serious health problems and was recovering from brain surgery when he died in the suburbs of Buenos Aires.

Investigators are looking at whether members of Maradona's medical team did not adequately treat the former soccer star, who played for teams around the world including Napoli, Barcelona and Boca Juniors.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Parliament on Wednesday adopted on a report calling on the European Commission to propose legislation forcing companies to find and fix risks to human rights and the environment in their supply chains.
While many European companies have sprawling global operations including in countries where environmental and human rights abuses are rife, there is currently no EU-wide requirement for them to have a due diligence process in place. 
The report adopted by the European Parliament aims to influence legislation the Commission will propose holding companies accountable for the impact of their business operations around the world.
The report asks the Commission to propose a law requiring companies established in the EU to identify, monitor, prevent and remedy risks to human rights, the environment and governance in their operations and business relationships - including suppliers and sub-contractors.
""The problem is ... certain companies, outsourcing their risks to vulnerable people or places for profits,"" said Lara Wolters, parliament's lead lawmaker on the report.
The core of the law should be a legal requirement for all companies to have a due diligence process in place, she said. National authorities could impose penalties for non-compliance and investigate complaints.
By forcing companies to comb their supply chains for issues, the aim is to prevent catastrophes like oil spills or the 2013 Rana Plaza disaster, when a Bangladesh garment factory building collapsed, killing more than 1,000 people. 
Parliament said the EU law should also give victims of human rights violations the right to take EU companies to court.

It also confirmed its support to the operations by the Yemeni national army and the tribes in Marib to advance and protect civilians.
The Houthis, who control Yemen’s most populous areas and have been battling the coalition since it intervened in Yemen's civil war in March 2015, have recently pushed towards the gas-rich region of Marib, aiming to take the government’s last stronghold in the north of Yemen.
The Iran-aligned group has also stepped up cross-border missile and drone attacks into Saudi Arabia.
The escalation comes as the United States and the United
Nations increase diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire to pave the
way for a resumption of U.N.-sponsored political talks to end
the conflict, which is largely seen in the region as a proxy war
between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Earlier on Wednesday, two residents told Reuters that a missile strike targeted a military base outskirts of Marib, adding that sounds of ambulances could be heard rushing to the place.
The base includes the building of the ministry of defence and is located near residential areas, they said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden moved to help children fleeing violence in Central America on Wednesday even as he grappled with a surge of migrants at the U.S. southern border that is taxing resources and exposing him to bipartisan criticism.
White House border coordinator Roberta Jacobson told reporters the Biden administration is restarting the Central American Minors (CAM) program for children, which between 2014 and 2017 allowed children fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to apply in their home countries to settle in the United States.
Then-President Donald Trump ended the program in 2017. It had allowed children under 21 years old with parents lawfully living in the United States to apply for a refugee resettlement interview as a way to avoid making the dangerous journey by themselves to the United States.
The move was the latest step taken by Biden as he tries to create a more humane situation along the border with Mexico.
Mixed messaging by the Biden White House, however, is leading to criticism from Republicans that he is encouraging migrants to make the dangerous journey to try to reach sanctuary in the United States. 
""The Biden border crisis is real and is only going to get worse,"" Representative Kevin Brady of Texas said at a news conference held by House Republicans on Wednesday. 
At the same time, Democrats complain that Biden is not moving fast enough to release children from Border Patrol custody.
U.S. officials are urging people not to try to cross the border, warning they will be sent back. Biden has not reversed a Trump-era public health rule that allows border agents to quickly expel most border crossers but is not applying the policy to unaccompanied minors. 
""The border is not open,"" said Jacobson, switching to Spanish on a number of occasions during a White House briefing to stress the point. The phrase was repeated in a call with reporters on Wednesday by Troy Miller, the senior official performing duties as the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
But that message is not sinking in.
Miller said agents on the U.S.-Mexico border encountered 100,441 migrants attempting to enter the country illegally in February, confirming the highest monthly total since a major border surge in mid-2019.
Miller said more than 19,000 of those encounters were families, close to 9,500 were unaccompanied minors and the remainder adults. Border officials said they also count repeat crossers in their numbers. 
Jacobson blamed migrant smugglers for the surge.
""We are trying to send both messages, and smugglers are trying to send only one message,"" she said.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said members of Biden's immigration team briefed him on a border visit they had and that they discussed how to speed up the processing of migrant children.
A State Department representative said in a statement Wednesday that the administration is set to resume processing CAM applications, starting with children whose cases were suspended under Trump and then opening up to new applicants. 

The department plans to reach out to parents starting as soon as March 15, the representative said. To date, the program has reunified almost 5,000 children with their parents.

SAO BERNARDO DO CAMPO, Brazil (Reuters) - Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva set the stage on Wednesday for a likely 2022 presidential run, using his first speech since his graft convictions were annulled to blast President Jair Bolsonaro's handling of the pandemic and economy. 
Lula, whose corruption convictions were overturned by a Supreme Court justice on Monday allowing him to return to political office, said he had not decided whether to run in next year's election. But his attacks on Bolsonaro, and the format of the event, had the clear feel of a campaign launch.
""This country is disorganized and falling apart because it has no government,"" he told the audience at the metalworkers union in Sao Bernardo do Campo, comparing the current economic crisis to strong growth and falling inequality when he led Brazil from 2003 until 2011.
""Health, jobs and justice for Brazil,"" read a banner hanging above the stage at the union, where Lula's political career took off as he organized nationwide strikes in the 1980s.
Lula attacked Bolsonaro directly for his record in handling the coronavirus pandemic, especially for delays in obtaining vaccines and for the president's public dismissal of their effectiveness.
Brazil has lost nearly 270,000 people to COVID-19, the worst death toll outside the United States, as local variants push the country's outbreak into its worst phase yet.
""Many of these deaths could have been avoided,"" Lula said.
Within hours of Lula's criticism, Bolsonaro and aides appeared masked at an official event in Brasilia — a rare sighting for the president, who has shunned masks, played down the gravity of the virus and said he would refuse a vaccine.
At the event, Bolsonaro defended his government's handling of the pandemic, saying Brazil would have 400 million vaccine doses by the end of this year.
""We were tireless from the first moment in fighting the pandemic,"" he said. 
Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, the president's son, tweeted a photo of his father with the slogan: ""The vaccine is our weapon.""
LULA MAKES HIS PITCH
In his speech, Lula cast himself as a veteran statesman eager to set the country on the right track, stressing his respect for the free press, business leaders and the military, while calling for a broad coalition to defeat Bolsonaro.
""I was called 'conciliatory' when I governed,"" he said. ""I'm open to talking with everyone.""
However, Lula also reinforced longstanding views that have set financial markets on edge at the prospect of his political resurrection. The former union leader decried privatizations, central bank autonomy and asset sales by state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras.
""Those who are buying things from Petrobras had best be afraid, because we can change a lot,"" Lula said. ""If the market wants to live off us selling national patrimony, then they should be afraid of me.""

A survey by pollster Real Time Big Data, released by CNN Brasil on Wednesday, showed both Lula and Bolsonaro with the support needed to reach a second-round vote.

Speaking in an interview to the local VDL News, Mohammed Fahmy blamed political parties that were unable to agree on a national rescue plan. 
""It is only natural that we are unable to perform our security duties in a complete way amidst this chaos, especially as Lebanese political parties could not put forward a national salvation plan to save the nation,"" he said. 
""Security forces are being drained daily, we have reached rock bottom... I am talking about 90% of our duties, we are no longer able to perform them to protect the people and the nation."" 
Lebanon's financial crisis, which erupted in 2019, has wiped out jobs, locked people out of their bank deposits and raised the risk of widespread hunger.
It has also piled strain on army and security forces as the currency crash wiped out most of the value of their salaries at a time when unrest and crime are surging.
Fahmy's comments come two days after Lebanese army chief General Joseph Aoun berated politicians saying that soldiers were going hungry like the rest of the nation.
""The solution starts with forming a government to save what is left of this nation,"" Fahmy said.
Lebanon's economic crisis was compounded after a port explosion in August devastated whole tracts of Beirut, killing 200 people. 
The explosion led to the resignation of Prime Minister Hassan Diab's government. It has stayed on in a caretaker capacity until a new cabinet is formed. 
But prime minister-designate Saad al-Hariri is at loggerheads with President Michel Aoun and has been unable to form a new government to carry out much needed reforms to unlock international aid since his nomination in October. 

""Three months ago I would say the security situation is starting to break down, now I am saying it has broken down, all possibilities are open.""

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast's Prime Minister Hamed Bakayoko, who was seen as a possible successor to President Alassane Ouattara, has died in Freiburg in south-west Germany, two days after his 56th birthday, the government said on Wednesday.
A former media executive who turned to politics, Bakayoko acted as a negotiator and intermediary between warring factions as a prolonged civil conflict racked Ivory Coast from the early 2000s.
A close ally of Ouattara, he was appointed as prime minister in July 2020 following the sudden death of his predecessor Amadou Gon Coulibaly, who had been handpicked by Ouattara to succeed him.
He was flown to France on Feb. 18 for medical checks and later to Freiburg in Germany. 

The government said in a statement on Friday that Ouattara had met Bakayoko during a visit in France last week, and given the state of the minister's health, it was recommended that his hospitalisation should be extended.

PARIS (Reuters) - A fire at a French cloud services firm has disrupted millions of websites, knocking out government agencies' portals, banks, shops, news websites and taking out a chunk of the .FR web space, according to internet monitors.
The fire, which broke out on Wednesday shortly after midnight at OVHcloud, destroyed one of four data centres in Strasbourg, in eastern France, and damaged another, the company said. 
There was no immediate explanation provided for the blaze, which erupted just two days after the French cloud computing firm kicked off plans for an initial public offering.
Europe's largest cloud services provider told clients including the French government, the Centre Pompidou and cryptocurrency exchange Deribit to activate their disaster recovery plans following the blaze. 
""Firefighters were immediately on the scene but could not control the fire"" in the affected data centre, founder and chairman Octave Klaba said on Twitter. He said the plan for the next couple of weeks would include rebuilding the centres' equipment and checking their fiber optic connections.
Some 100 firemen fought the blaze which sent a thick plume of black smoke into the night sky. Video images showed firefighters dousing one smouldering, multi-storey building in the early morning as they cooled down the site. 
Founded by Klaba in 1999, OVHcloud competes against U.S. giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Azure and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Cloud, which dominate the market.
""OVH is a pretty important hosting company on the internet,"" said Mike Prettejohn, who directs UK-based network security company Netcraft. He said the affected servers hosted 3.6 million websites, including niche government platforms in France, Britain, Poland and the Ivory Coast.
Prettejohn estimated that just under 2% of the sites with the French .FR domain extension had been affected.
French politicians have championed OVHcloud as a possible alternative to U.S. cloud services providers, but it has so far lacked the scale and financial clout to dent their market share.
The company said on Monday it had started the process for a potential IPO, without giving details.
The Strasbourg centres were among OVHcloud's 17 data centres in France, and 32 globally.
Several clients said their websites had gone offline or emails could not be accessed. There was no immediate news of any major data losses.
The Centre Pompidou, one of France's best known art complexes, said its website was down. Cryptocurrency exchange Deribit said its blog was down but that trading had not been impacted, free chess server Lichess.org said it had lost 24 hours' worth of games history and news outlet eeNews Europe said its websites were offline.
PR agency Caroline Charles Communication said its data was held at another site but that it had lost access to emails in the middle of Paris Fashion Week. 

OVHcloud declined to comment on its fire safety protocols. The site did not pose a toxic risk, it added.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 02:40PM ET</span>",Russia moves to slow Twitter's speed after protest row,"By Tom Balmforth and Maria Kiselyova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Wednesday it was slowing down the speed of Twitter in retaliation for what it described as a failure to remove banned content, threatening to block the U.S. platform outright if it did not comply with its deletion demands.
The move escalates a growing stand-off between Moscow and U.S. social media firms. It comes weeks after Russian authorities accused Twitter and others of failing to delete posts that Moscow said illegally urged children to take part in anti-Kremlin protests.
In Wednesday's announcement, Russia's Roskomnadzor communications regulator referred to what it said was illegal content on Twitter containing child pornography, information about drug abuse and calls for minors to commit suicide.
Twitter said it was worried about the impact on free speech of the Russian action, and denied that it allowed its platform to be used to promote illegal behaviour.
""We remain committed to advocating for the Open Internet around the world and are deeply concerned by increased attempts to block and throttle online public conversation,"" a Twitter spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
""Let us be clear – we have a zero-tolerance policy regarding child sexual exploitation, it is against the Twitter Rules to promote, glorify or encourage suicide and self harm, and we do not allow the use of Twitter for any unlawful behaviour or to further illegal activities, including the buying and selling of drugs.""
Russia has traditionally taken a more hands-off role in policing the internet than neighbouring China. But as domestic political tensions have risen this year over the arrest and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny - which triggered nationwide protests - it has signalled a tougher line. 
Roskomnadzor said that as of Wednesday there were more than 3,000 posts containing illegal content on Twitter, which it accused of ignoring its deletion requests for years.
""The slowing down will be applied to 100% of mobile devices and on 50% of non-mobile devices,"" the regulator said.
""If (Twitter) continues to ignore the requirements of the law, the enforcement measures will be continued... (right up to blocking it),"" the regulator said.
Twitter was already under pressure in Russia after it was named as one of five social media platforms being sued for allegedly failing to delete posts urging children to take part in illegal protests, the Interfax news agency cited a Moscow court as saying on Tuesday.
'CONTROL THE INFORMATION SPACE'
The Kremlin said there was no desire to block content but that companies had to abide by the law.
Some activists, however, said they believed the curbs were linked to recent protests. 
""Of course the main motive is the increase in street protest action,"" said Sarkis Darbinyan, an internet freedom advocate with the Roskomsvoboda group.
""It's 10 years since the Arab spring this year... they've understood the internet is a driving force. Any desire to control the Russian internet is connected to the desire to control the information space.""
Navalny's allies say they plan new protests in coming months.
Some government websites were unavailable for some Russian internet users shortly after the announcement about Twitter. 
Telecoms operator Rostelecom said the disruption to several government websites, including those of the Kremlin and parliament, was not caused by new restrictions imposed on Twitter but by an equipment malfunction.
Vadim Subbotin, an official at Roskomnadzor, said it was possible that the authorities could target and slow down other internet platforms if they failed to comply with the law, the Interfax news agency reported.

Moscow has gradually introduced tougher internet laws in recent years, requiring search engines to delete some search results, messaging services to share encryption keys with security services and platforms to store user data on servers in Russia.

861,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 02:30PM ET</span>",Explainer: What is the U.S. Senate filibuster and why is everyone talking about it?,"By Susan Cornwell
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pressure is growing among President Joe Biden's Democrats to end the filibuster, a long-standing Senate custom that requires a supermajority to advance most legislation in a chamber that in recent years has been closely divided and is now split 50/50 between the two parties.
As long as the filibuster exists, liberal Democrats say, Republicans in the chamber that likes to call itself ""the world's greatest deliberative body"" will be able to use it to block progress on their priorities, including addressing climate change, voting rights and immigration.
WHAT IS THE FILIBUSTER?
To ""filibuster"" means to delay action on a bill or other issue by talking. 
The Senate filibuster first captured the American imagination in Frank Capra's 1939 movie ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" when Jimmy Stewart's character spoke for more than a day, and more recently in 2013 when Texas state Senator Wendy Davis spoke for 13 hours to try to block a bill imposing new restrictions on abortion.
The popular image of a lone lawmaker mounting an impassioned hours-long argument belies the reality in today's Senate, where a mere threat is often enough to initiate a filibuster and hold up a bill.
A filibuster can only be stopped if 60 senators vote to end debate in a process called cloture.
WHY IS THE RULE A PROBLEM FOR DEMOCRATS?
With just 50 senators, Democrats will not be able to overcome filibusters on their bills unless at least 10 Republicans vote with them. 
But many Republicans are deeply skeptical of Democratic priorities and unlikely to help build supermajorities.
Democrats were able to pass Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus plan without a supermajority through another Senate maneuver called ""reconciliation,"" with the help of Vice President Kamala Harris's tie-breaking 51st vote. But the rules limit the use of that process.
Senate Republicans, led by Mitch McConnell, say Democrats should work to produce bipartisan legislation instead of trying to end or change the filibuster. 
Biden, who served in the Senate for 36 years, does not favor a change, according to the White House.
WHEN DID THE SENATE ADOPT THE FILIBUSTER RULE?
Although the U.S. Constitution makes no mention of filibusters, long-winded Senate speeches became an increasingly common tactic in the 19th century.
By 1917 most senators had had enough, agreeing that a vote by a two-thirds majority could end debate.
But getting two-thirds of the Senate was hard, so filibusters continued. Notoriously, they were used by southern senators who sought to block civil rights laws.
In 1975, the Senate reduced the requirement for limiting debate to three-fifths of the Senate - currently 60 senators.
In that decade, the Senate leadership began agreeing to allow measures that were facing a filibuster to be put aside while the chamber acted on other bills.
The move was intended to prevent opposition to a single bill bringing all work in the chamber to halt, but it also meant that the filibuster changed from an energy-draining maneuver involving lengthy speeches to a mere objection, or threat to object.
Over time the number of filibusters skyrocketed. There is no sure-fire way of counting how many bills are filibustered in a year because of the nebulous nature of the threats. But a count of votes to try to overcome a filibuster, the nearest reliable proxy, shows 298 such votes in the 2019-2020 legislative session. That's up from 168 such votes in the previous two years. In 1969-1970 there were six.
Putting filibustered bills aside ""made filibustering actually more successful, and even less costly, which was not intended. And it might have, paradoxically, made things worse,"" said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University who co-wrote a book on the filibuster.
CAN THE FILIBUSTER BE CHANGED?
There have already been changes, in addition to changing the number of votes required for cloture.
In 2013, Democrats removed the 60-vote threshold for voting on most nominees for administration jobs, apart from the Supreme Court, allowing them to advance on a simple majority vote.
In 2017, Republicans did the same thing for Supreme Court nominees.
Recently some centrist Democrats have joined ranks with liberals including Senator Jeff Merkley, who has long favored reforming the 60-vote threshold for legislation.
""The filibuster has long been the enemy of progress. In fact, it's been a highly effective tool to thwart the will of the people,"" Senator Tina Smith wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after coming to support an end to the filibuster. 
The Senate's No. 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin, suggested the party should try bringing some bills with bipartisan appeal to the floor to see if they are filibustered. If they can't get at least 60 votes, then the caucus could talk about possible modifications to the procedure.
WHO OPPOSES CHANGE?
McConnell, for one. At the start of this year he tried but failed to get an explicit promise from his Democratic counterpart Chuck Schumer to protect the filibuster.

But at least two Senate Democrats, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, both moderates, also do not want to ditch the 60-vote threshold. Without them, Schumer does not have the majority needed to gut the rule.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager charged with the fatal shooting of two men in Wisconsin last summer during protests against police brutality, will start on Nov. 1, a judge ruled on Wednesday, giving lawyers on both sides more time to prepare. 
The 18-year-old is charged with first-degree homicide and five other criminal counts related to the Aug. 25 killings of Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber in the Wisconsin city of Kenosha, and the wounding of a third man, Gaige Grosskreutz. 
Jury selection in the case had been scheduled to begin on March 29. But during a hearing over Zoom on Wednesday, Kenosha Circuit Court Judge Bruce Schroeder pushed back the date after attorneys asked for more time for discovery and jury logistics, online court records showed. 
Schroeder also scheduled a final pre-trial hearing for May 17.
Kenosha erupted in violent protests over police brutality following the Aug. 23 police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man who was left seriously wounded. Two days after the shooting, Rittenhouse traveled from his home in nearby Antioch, Illinois, in a self-appointed role to protect Kenosha businesses. 
Rittenhouse’s legal team has said their client, who is white, feared for his life when he fired his semi-automatic rifle, and have indicated they plan to argue self-defense.

In February, Schroeder ruled that Rittenhouse could remain free on bond and had no obligation publicly disclose his whereabouts, denying prosecutors’ requests.

864,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 01:56PM ET</span>","Analysis: Facing critics, Biden has no good choices to manage influx of migrant children","By Ted Hesson and Mica Rosenberg
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is racing to deal with an increasing number of migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, but it has limited options and ""none are great,"" one U.S. official said. 
The influx, which comes as Biden relaxes some of former President Donald Trump's more restrictive immigration policies, has left the Democratic president facing criticism not only from opposition Republicans but also members of his own party, who say some children are being held in custody for too long.
Biden's administration, however, faces legal, space and cost constraints as it tries first to house and then speed the release of thousands of children coming over the border. 
Under U.S. law, federal health officials are required to provide housing and care for unaccompanied migrant children until they can be placed with a parent or other sponsor, but they have limited bed space in state-licensed facilities to do so.
Roberta Jacobson, Biden's border czar, and the U.S. State Department announced on Wednesday the re-start of the Central American Minors program, which had allowed children to apply in their home countries to join relatives in the United States but had been ended under Trump. In a press briefing, Jacobson said repeatedly that the message to migrants is that now is not the time to come to the U.S.-Mexico border. 
If the number of children arriving without a parent or legal guardian continues to rise, officials will have to expand emergency housing, start a time-consuming process to open more licensed facilities or release children faster. 
""We will have to make big and small changes,"" the U.S. official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal operations, told Reuters. ""(We are) assessing options now because none are great.""
Migrant children are supposed to be transferred out of Border Patrol custody within 72 hours. But when shelter space is limited, they can get stuck in border detention centers for longer periods - as is happening now, according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
In 2019, migrant advocates raised concerns about hundreds of children - including toddlers - being detained without adequate food, clean clothes and diapers, toothbrushes or showers.
Robert Carey, who directed the refugee office at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under former President Barack Obama, said changing the policies around housing children will not happen quickly ""even if they are putting a tremendous amount of effort into it.""
""It’s a Herculean task,"" he said. 
CHALLENGES
Biden is already running up against some of the same issues that vexed previous administrations.
(Graphic on border apprehensions https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-IMMIGRATION/BORDER/xklpyoalapg/index.html) 
One example of complications facing the president - U.S. health officials on Friday lifted coronavirus-related restrictions that cut federal shelter capacity by 40% and maxed-out bed space.
The relaxation of the restrictions boosted capacity to about 13,000, with 8,100 children in government custody as of Monday. But beds are filling up quickly. 
While officials acknowledge that allowing more children into the shelters will raise the risk of more COVID-19 cases, the administration says it has little choice, since it takes so long to open new facilities.
Long-term shelters need state licensing that complies with local child welfare laws, a process that could take up to a year and can be hamstrung by local opposition from both critics of detention centers and anti-immigration groups. 
Emergency influx shelters can be erected more quickly on federal properties, and the Biden administration is surveying agencies to see what options might be available, including military bases. 
Finding adequate federally controlled land or buildings that can be made available and converted for children in a short amount of time is a challenge, said Mark Greenberg, a former top official at HHS, which oversees the shelters. 
Greenberg worked at the department during a 2014 surge in unaccompanied minors.
""We spent a lot of time to trying to identify other federal properties that might be available in the future,"" he said of the efforts. ""Most agencies did not have property to offer.""
The best option would be smaller-scale shelters or foster homes, but finding and opening those sorts of spaces are longer-term projects, according to Leah Chavla, a senior policy adviser with the New York City-based Women's Refugee Commission. 
OUT FASTER
One way to lessen the need for housing is to speed up the release of children to U.S. sponsors - something Biden has asked about in meetings, according to White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki.
But move too fast and predators may try to take advantage of the system, according to former HHS officials. In 2013 and 2014, for example, some Guatemalan teenagers were released and then forced to work on an egg farm in Ohio.
""We need to take the time to vet the individuals who these kids are being connected with,"" Psaki told MSNBC on Tuesday. ""We're trying to figure out how to expedite this process.""
Some measures are already being put in place, but the moves are unlikely to have a significant effect on the housing crunch if the number of children arriving keeps rising.
U.S. officials are now sending unaccompanied children to shelters in the interior of the country instead of automatically quarantining them for 14 days near the border, according to a person familiar with the decision. They are also streamlining background checks of sponsors by moving to a new database system.
Cecilia Munoz, a top White House official dealing with immigration issues under Obama, said handling unaccompanied minors at the border will be one of the biggest challenges for the Biden administration, which she said inherited problems caused by Trump's border policies. 

""I've lived through my own version of this,"" Munoz said. If ""you have hundreds of kids in Border Patrol lock ups, and they can't stay there, you have few options and your options are more expensive.""

It will also address prison reform, trade deals, the U.S. relationship with China and the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic, the probe into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, Trump's impeachment drama, the border crisis and events surrounding the death in police custody of George Floyd, the source said.
Kushner is ""not looking to settle scores but rather to provide historical context and help readers understand what it was like to work in the Trump White House,"" the source said.
""It will be an interesting perspective from someone who had a wide-ranging portfolio, was in the room for many of the most tense and consequential moments but kept a fairly low public profile, staying behind the scenes and granting limited media access,"" the source said.

Kushner, 40, and his wife Ivanka, Trump's daughter, moved to Miami after their stint in Washington.

868,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 01:35PM ET</span>","U.N. Security Council agrees to condemn Myanmar violence, urge military restraint","By Michelle Nichols
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council agreed on a statement on Wednesday that condemns violence against Myanmar protesters and urges military restraint, diplomats said, but dropped language condemning the army takeover as a coup and threatening possible further action due to opposition by China, Russia, India and Vietnam.
The British-drafted statement, which had to be agreed by consensus, now has to be formally adopted at a council meeting.
Myanmar has been in crisis since the army ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government in a Feb. 1 coup, detained her and officials of her National League for Democracy party and set up a ruling junta of generals.
The military complained of fraud in a November election. The election commission said the vote was fair.
""The Security Council strongly condemns the violence against peaceful protestors, including against women, youth and children,"" according to the agreed statement, seen by Reuters. ""The council calls for the military to exercise utmost restraint and emphasizes that it is following the situation closely.""
The council also expresses deep concern at restrictions on medical personnel, civil society, labor union members, journalists and media workers, and ""calls for the immediate release of all those detained arbitrarily.""
More than 60 people have been killed and some 1,800 people detained in a crackdown on daily protests against the coup around the southeast Asian nation, an advocacy group has said. Dozens of journalists are among those arrested.
The council statement ""expresses its continued support for the democratic transition in Myanmar, and stresses the need to uphold democratic institutions and processes, refrain from violence, fully respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and uphold the rule of law.""
The negotiations over the text, which began after a closed briefing on Friday, signaled that the council could struggle to do much more on Myanmar. Russia and China, who are council veto powers along with the United States, France and Britain, have traditionally shielded Myanmar from any strong council action.
An initial draft of Wednesday's statement, seen by Reuters, condemned the military coup and said the council was ready ""to consider possible further measures,"" which is generally seen as code for sanctions. But diplomats said Russia, China, India and Vietnam all proposed amendments and that language was dropped.
An independent U.N. human rights investigator on Myanmar and New York-based Human Rights Watch have called on the Security Council to impose a global arms embargo and targeted economic sanctions on the junta.
Security Council efforts on Myanmar were limited to two statements after a 2017 military crackdown sent hundreds of thousands Rohingya Muslims fleeing into Bangladesh and led to U.N. accusations of ethnic cleansing, which the army denied.

In a statement to the press days after the coup, the council expressed concern over the state of emergency imposed by the Myanmar military and called for the release of all those detained.

The number of people treated in intensive care units for the disease was unchanged at 3,918, halting a five-day-long increase, but staying at a three-and-a-half-month high.
Health Minister Olivier Veran is due to give his weekly COVID briefing on Thursday but no major announcements are expected, even though some health experts say the hospital system in the greater Paris region is close to breaking point.
The seven-day moving average of new cases, which evens out daily reporting irregularities, stood at 21,836, above 21,000 for the 14th time in 15 days.
The government says that average new cases figures should be under 5,000 for the pandemic to be considered to be under control.
Since the outbreak of the disease more than a year ago, France has reported 3.963 million cases, the sixth-highest total in the world.
There were 264 new deaths over the past 24 hours, taking the total to 89,565, the seventh-highest in the world, versus a seven-day daily moving average of 289.
The health ministry also reported on Wednesday that 4.32 million people, or 6.5% of the adult population, had received a first coronavirus vaccine and 2.10 million had received a second shot, for a total of 6,425 million injections.

The government aims to vaccinate 10 million people by mid-April - less than a sixth of the total population - 20 million by mid-May and 30 million by the summer.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department this week charged another associate of the anti-government Oath Keepers militia over his alleged role in storming the U.S. Capitol.
Joshua A. James, 33, of Arab, Alabama, is at least the 11th person associated with the far-right militia to face charges in connection with the deadly Jan. 6 siege, which left five people dead and caused more than 130 police officers to be injured as they tried to protect the Capitol from a mob of former President Donald Trump's supporters.
Nine of the group's alleged associates are charged in a superseding indictment with conspiring to storm the Capitol as far back as November. 
James is at least the second Oath Keepers associate who was captured in photographs providing security for Roger Stone, Trump's longtime friend and ally, who spoke at political rallies leading up to the attack. 
Earlier this week, Roberto Minuta, 36, was also identified as providing security to Stone before he allegedly stormed the Capitol. He is also facing criminal charges.
The photographs of Stone's Oath Keepers security detail were published in the New York Times last month, and the article is referenced in the charging documents for both Minuta and James.
Stone, in a statement earlier this week, denied knowing Minuta, and said he had no advanced knowledge the Capitol would be attacked.
According to the charging documents, James was captured in photographs on Jan. 6 wearing tactical gear with Oath Keepers insignia.
""Publicly-available video also captured James inside the Capitol building,"" the complaint says.
James is due to appear in a federal court in Alabama on Thursday for a detention hearing. His public defender declined to comment.

More than 300 people have been charged so far in connection with the attack on the U.S. Capitol, and the FBI has been increasingly focused on suspects with ties to right-wing extremist groups.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A divided federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled against anti-abortion protesters who have tried to discourage women from entering a reproductive health clinic in the New York City borough of Queens.
Ruling in favor of the New York attorney general's office, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected claims by the 13 protesters that a federal law and a similar state law protecting abortion providers and patients from attacks and threats of force violated their constitutional free speech rights.
In a 116-page decision, Circuit Judge Rosemary Pooler said the federal law was designed to be broad, ""given the health risks women needing reproductive care face because of the increased stress, anxiety, and agitation"" from misconduct by protesters.
The 2-1 majority also said New York faced irreparable harm absent an injunction against the Saturday morning protests at the Choices Women's Medical Center in Jamaica because the protests, which began in 2012, could recur.
Chief Judge Debra Ann Livingston dissented, accusing the majority of effectively creating ""'buffer zone' equivalents, thereby threatening the ongoing suppression of legitimate First Amendment activity.""
The appeals court returned the case to U.S. District Judge Carol Bagley Amon in Brooklyn, who in July 2018 rejected the state's request for an injunction against the protests.
Neither the protesters' lawyers nor the office of state Attorney General Letitia James had an immediate comment.
Wednesday's decision comes as many states and anti-abortion activists push to curb abortion access, hoping a conservative Supreme Court majority will weaken or overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing abortion as a constitutional right.
The lawsuit had been brought in 2017 by Eric Schneiderman, then New York's attorney general.
He said protesters crowded women trying to enter the Choices clinic, made death threats to people trying to escort them, and blocked their path with posters purportedly of aborted fetuses.
Amon had found no proof that the protesters intended to ""harass, annoy, or alarm"" patients and their escorts.
The case is New York v Griepp et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 18-2454, 18-2623, 18-2627 and 18-2630.

""The prime minister raised the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other British-Iranian dual nationals detained in Iran and demanded their immediate release,"" a statement from Johnson's office said after a call with Rouhani on Wednesday. 
""He (Johnson) said that while the removal of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's ankle monitor was welcome, her continued confinement remains completely unacceptable and she must be allowed to return to her family in the UK.""
Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation charity, was arrested at a Tehran airport in April 2016 and convicted of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denied the charges.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe served a five-year sentence which ended on Sunday. An ankle bracelet was removed, allowing her freedom to travel in Iran, but she still cannot leave the country, as she has been ordered to appear for a new court case on March 14 on charges of propaganda against the Iranian state.
Johnson also restated Britain's commitment to making a success of a multilateral 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, and urged Rouhani to end Iranian breaches of the terms of that deal that began after the United States withdrew from it in 2018.
""He stressed the importance of Iran seizing the opportunity presented by the United States' willingness to return to the deal if Iran comes back into compliance,"" the statement said.

TUNIS (Reuters) - The speaker of Tunisia's parliament, Rached Ghannouchi, said he backs calls for a new national dialogue to address the country's political standoff and constant disputes over the constitution.
Speaking to Reuters in an interview, Ghannouchi, head of the moderate Islamist Ennahda party, reaffirmed his preference for a parliamentary political system and said the standoff was endangering urgent economic reforms. 
""There is a state of crisis that imposes dialogue... There needs to be a political dialogue on the constitution. And an economic and social dialogue on the mode of development,"" he said in the interview late on Tuesday. 
Ghannouchi has been one of Tunisia's main political players since the 2011 revolution that ended autocratic rule and ushered in democracy but only stood for public office for the first time in 2019 when he entered parliament and became speaker.
That election returned a deeply fragmented parliament in which Ennahda, as the biggest party, secured only a quarter of seats. A separate presidential election the same month was won by Kais Saied, an independent. 
The result has been 18 months of political turmoil, while Tunisia's public debt has soared and little progress has been made on economic reforms sought by foreign lenders whose funds are critical to financing the deficit. 
""The constitution needs to be amended towards becoming either a completely presidential or parliamentary system. We support a parliamentary system,"" said Ghannouchi. 
He also called for an amended electoral law that would make it easier for big parties to win more seats and ensure greater stability.
CONSTITUTION
A dialogue has already been proposed by Tunisia's powerful labour union, which has a million members and was part of a civil society grouping that won a Nobel peace prize in 2015 for helping to end an earlier political crisis. 
However, the idea, initially embraced by Saied, has made little headway. Ghannouchi had already called for a national dialogue on economic reforms but has not previously backed the idea of inclusive talks on the political system. 
The latest crisis was triggered by Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi's decision to sack four cabinet members allied to Saied, who has in turn refused to swear in their replacements. 
Ghannouchi rejected calls to replace Mechichi and start afresh with a new cabinet, saying this would further delay economic reforms. 
""We support a small cabinet like this one that can carry out the necessary reforms,"" he added.
The dispute echoes other clashes between presidents and prime ministers since the adoption of the 2014 constitution that shared power between the two branches of state. 
Disputes were meant to be resolved through a constitutional court of 12 judges appointed by parliament, the president and a judicial committee, but it has yet to be formed due to disagreements.

Ghannouchi said he hoped to bring together party leaders this week for another attempt at choosing members of the court: ""It is a way out of the crisis.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - United Nations human rights experts said on Wednesday they were looking into 200 killings alleged to have been committed by Venezuelan police forces this year amid concerns about possible summary executions.
Voicing concern about unlawful killings, they said that authorities have failed to release death certificates, charged fees for autopsies, and delivered bodies in a closed casket ""with the instruction that it not be opened"".
Venezuela's delegation dismissed the allegations without addressing them specifically. ""Once again the fact-finding mission presents politicised information with no balance and fairness,"" said Hector Constant Rosales, Venezuela's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva.
Marta Valinas, head of a U.N. fact-finding mission, said the toll of 200 included people killed in a large police operation in the La Vega neighbourhood of the capital, Caracas, from Jan. 7-9.
""Our preliminary investigations indicate that at least some of those killed were victims of extrajudicial executions,"" she told the U.N. Human Rights Council.
At least 23 people died over that weekend in a clash between police and gangs, according to news reports and activists, as the government faced international scrutiny for killings by security forces.
Brazil and the United States, speaking at the council in Geneva, raised concerns about what U.S. charge d'affaires Mark Cassayre called the ""massacre"" in La Vega.
Valinas said that at least 36 people had been unlawfully detained, including journalists, since September and that some arrests appeared to be ""politically motivated"".
""The state’s concept of the 'internal enemy' appears to be increasingly broad,"" she said.
More than 20 people, including health care workers, have been detained for speaking out about the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, she added.
The independent investigators said last September that the government of President Nicolas Maduro has committed systematic human rights violations including killings and torture amounting to crimes against humanity.

GAZA (Reuters) - Yehya Al-Sinwar has been re-elected to head Hamas in the Gaza Strip for a second term, officials said on Wednesday, reflecting his control over both political and military wings of the Islamist group that rules the Palestinian enclave.
Sinwar, Hamas leader in Gaza since 2017, was freed in a 2011 prisoner swap with Israel after spending more than 20 years behind bars on charges that included killing suspected informants against Palestinian militants.
While he supports Hamas' opposition to co-existence with Israel, Sinwar has maintained a relatively stable standoff across the Gaza border.
He has also sought improved ties with Egypt, which maintains restrictions along its frontier with Gaza, a small Mediterranean coastal territory.
""Sinwar's victory shows the man maintains a strong grip on things inside the movement, especially within its vital components such as the military wing,"" said Gaza political analyst Adnan Abu Amer.
""The win will enable Sinwar to pursue his policies, whether inside Gaza or with regional countries and the handling of the conflict with Israel.""
Sinwar's main challenger in the election, which is only open to Hamas members including those in Israeli prisons, was Nizar Awadallah, a long-time official and co-negotiator of the 2011 swap deal.
In a statement issued by Awadallah, he stressed his support for Sinwar, saying: ""We stand by his side in every position to achieve the goals of our project and our movement.""
Hamas has yet to elect a leader for the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Sources said his identity would be kept secret as protection against Israel or the administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, a Hamas rival.
Filling the position of Hamas’s political chief, who also speaks for its military wing, will require more time. The overall leader of Hamas is Ismail Haniyeh, who is also based in Gaza.

Haniyeh is facing a challenge this time by the former head of the group, Khaled Meshaal, who lives in Qatar.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Alaska has become the first U.S. state to make COVID-19 vaccines available to anyone age 16 or older, eliminating eligibility requirements for people who work or live in the state.
Governor Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, announced the new rules on Tuesday for his state of about 730,000 people. More than one quarter of Alaskans have received least one vaccine shot, second only to New Mexico, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Certain regions of Alaska are nearing a 90% vaccination rate among elderly people, officials said.
Many states are struggling to meet the vast demand for vaccines. Differing eligibility requirements have created a patchwork system, with certain states still restricting vaccines to adults 65 or older, along with people in high-risk groups.
The COVID-19 vaccines developed by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are approved only for people age 18 and older, but younger Alaskans can receive the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccine.
Officials hope that making vaccinations widely available will boost the crucial tourism industry ahead of the summer.
""Alaska's also somewhat of a seasonal state with regard to aspects of the economy,"" Dunleavy said at a news conference. ""We're hoping that we can get the cruise ships back there, the tourism industry back here.""

As of Tuesday morning, more than 123 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines had been distributed in the United States and 93.7 million shots had been administered, according to the CDC.

In a rare first-hand account of the treatment of detained activists, the man told Reuters he was one of about 60 people picked up on Tuesday by police in Myeik, a southern coastal town, as they hid in a house after a protest was broken up by them.
A military spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment on the man's allegations. Myeik police station did not answer its phone. The army has previously said it is dealing with protests lawfully.
The man provided photographs which he said were taken by his family showing injuries on his back, neck and shoulders.
Reuters has verified that the photographs were of the man and that his family had taken them. The news agency, which spoke to the man by telephone, could not verify his account.
The protesters were put in a truck and handed over to troops at Myeik air base, where the men were separated from the women, photographed and taken to a room, the man said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of being detained again.
Reuters was unable to reach the air base for comment.
""We got beaten the whole time even while we were walking to the room,"" he said. ""The soldiers said, 'This is the hell room, why don't you guys have a taste?'""
He described being told to kneel and said five of the group were told to face each other while they were beaten on their backs, heads, necks and sides. He said he was later freed along with several others without explanation. Some others were formally arrested and sent to jail.
Reuters was unable to contact the jail for comment.
Pyae Phyo Aung, a former student union member in Myeik who has been in touch with released protesters, told Reuters 32 people were arrested in the incident, according to a list that he helped compile for civil society groups. He said he saw another protester with injuries on his back and hip.
""When I met him, he couldn't even sit,"" Pyae Phyo Aung said. ""He was lying face down because of the injuries on his hips.""
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government in a coup on Feb. 1 and detained her and other politicians. 
The military says an election in November won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) was marred by fraud - a claim rejected by the national electoral commission - and has set up a junta to rule the country pending a new vote on an unspecified date. 
Security forces have cracked down with increasing force on daily nationwide protests, and more than 60 demonstrators have been killed and 1,900 people arrested since the coup, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners has said.
Reuters has not been able to confirm the figures independently.

At least two people, both NLD officials, have died in custody since last Saturday after being arrested, according to party sources, although the reason for their deaths is not known. The military has not commented on this.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - An internal investigation at Scania into its Indian operations found evidence of misconduct by employees including senior management, the Swedish bus and truck maker said on Wednesday, adding the individuals involved had all left the company.
The news comes after three media outlets, including Swedish news channel SVT, reported Scania paid bribes to win bus contracts in seven Indian states between 2013 and 2016.
A Scania spokesman said the company, part of Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY)'s commercial vehicle arm Traton SE, started its internal investigation in 2017. The results have not previously been disclosed. 
""This misconduct included alleged bribery, bribery through business partners and misrepresentation,"" he said, without giving further details.
SVT's allegations included that Scania delivered a specially equipped bus to a company with connections to India's Minister of Transport Nitin Gadkari that was intended for his daughter's wedding and was not fully paid for.
""Gadkari and his family members have absolutely nothing to do with the purchase or sale of the bus,"" Gadkari's office said in a statement.
""Since the entire episode of the Scania bus is an internal affair of the Swedish company, it will prudent for the media to wait for an official statement by Scania India which handled the matter,"" it added. 
The Scania spokesman said the company had not sold a bus to Gadkari and declined to comment further. 
Scania CEO Henrik Henriksson told SVT the company had stopped selling city buses in India and had closed down its factory there.
""We may have been a bit naive, but we really went for it ... we really wanted to make it in India but underestimated the risks,"" he was quoted as saying.
Henriksson said any wrongdoing in India had been committed by a few individuals who had since left the company, and all involved business partners had had their contracts canceled.
The Scania spokesman said its investigation of wrongdoing had not involved the police.
""While the evidence is sufficient to prove breaches in compliance with Scania's own business codes so that the company can take severe action accordingly, the evidence is not strong enough to lead to prosecution,"" the spokesman said.

(Reuters) - Callers seeking the parents of lost children have been regularly dialling in to radio and television programmes since a series of explosions levelled much of Equatorial Guinea's largest city and sent thousands fleeing for the countryside.
Three days on, residents of Bata are still coming to grips with the full scale of a tragedy that has killed at least 105 people and injured more than 600 others.
Drone footage aired on state television showed block after block of public housing in the coastal city either completely destroyed or close to it, the remnants of their roofs and walls strewn across the neighbourhood's dirt roads.
""There are many children without parents,"" said a teacher in Bata, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals from the authorities in the tightly-controlled central African country. ""In the long (term) what do we do with those children?""
The reclusive government blamed the explosions on fires set by farmers living near the military base and the negligent handling of dynamite stocks by the military unit guarding them.
It has decreed three days of national mourning from Wednesday, declared Bata a catastrophe zone, unblocked 10 billion ($18.19 million) CFA francs for the response and appealed for international aid.
Firefighters continued to comb the rubble on Wednesday for bodies as onlookers wept, state television showed. The authorities appealed for donations of blood and basic goods.
A five-year old girl was pulled on Wednesday from the rubble of a house in the military camp where the blast occurred, Equato-Guinean media AhoraEG said.
Officials have been forced to turn to refrigerated containers to store bodies, said the teacher and Alfredo Okenve, a human rights activist who lives in exile in Europe.
Okenve said his information indicated the number of deaths was between 150 and 200, significantly higher than the government's official toll of 105. 
Virgilio Seriche, an official at the information ministry, denied that bodies were being stored in containers and said authorities were providing up-to-date information about the number of confirmed deaths. 
""The reliable data is what the government is publishing about this incident, not what comes from other sources,"" he told Reuters.
TRAUMATISED
Bata residents are traumatised from the explosions, which lasted for hours on Sunday, and fearful of additional blasts.
The first explosion ""was so big that all of us and the people around us were shouting: 'This is a bomb, this is a bomb!'"" said the teacher. 
""People were crying, shouting, running, trying to stay somewhere, but it was panic. We started to see police cars and firemen and people bleeding. It was awful."" 
The health ministry said in a tweet that it was deploying psychiatrists and psychologists. 
The United Nations said on Wednesday that the World Health Organization and children's agency UNICEF had mobilised teams to control infection and provide logistical support. Spain has sent a first batch of emergency aid. 
The former Spanish colony has been run by President Teodoro Obiang Nguema, Africa's longest-serving leader, since 1979.
It is the Central African country's worst tragedy in recent memory, and while the government, charitable organisations and private citizens have kept everyone fed and sheltered for now, most of Equatorial Guinea's 1.4 million people live in poverty.
The country is also suffering a double economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic and a drop in the price of crude oil, which provides about three-fourths of state revenue. 
State media has provided wall-to-wall coverage of the disaster, including the appeals over the lost children, a rarity in a country that human rights activists consider one of Africa's most repressive and where bad news is often suppressed.
Okenve said the scale of the tragedy had left the government with no choice. 
""If there is information coming out, it is because it is impossible to control,"" he said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - World powers bear responsibility for ignoring crimes against humanity that may still be perpetrated by authorities in North Korea amid a focus on its nuclear programme, a U.N. human rights investigator said on Wednesday.
Tomas Ojea-Quintana urged the U.N. Security Council to refer grave violations in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to the International Criminal Court for prosecution. 
He voiced concern at reports of severe punishments imposed for breaking COVID-19 lockdown measures, including alleged orders to ""shoot on sight"" anyone trying to cross the border.
""Crimes against humanity may be ongoing,"" Ojea-Quintana told the U.N. Human Rights Council. 
He had received information confirming the findings of a landmark 2014 U.N. Commission of Inquiry on extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, rape, forced abortion, sexual violence, political persecution and ""the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation"" in the isolated country.
""The urgency to stop violations of such a scale, gravity and nature cannot take a back seat to national interests or geopolitical interests,"" Ojea-Quintana told the Geneva forum.
This was not justifiable under the U.N. Charter, he said, adding: ""I believe that the Security Council bears responsibility for its inaction against the continuation of crimes against humanity in the DPR Korea."" 
Ojea-Quintana presented his latest report, issued last week, which said that drastic measures taken by North Korea to contain the novel coronavirus have exacerbated abuses and economic hardship for its citizens, including reports of starvation.
""We are concerned about increasing reports of starvation, imprisonment and summary executions,"" U.S. charge d'affaires Mark Cassayre told the council.
Australia's deputy ambassador, Jeffrey Roach, said that North Korea's top priority should be improving the lives of its citizens. ""Instead, the regime’s focus remains on developing weapons of mass destruction and the vehicles for delivering them,"" he said.
North Korea's mission to the U.N. in Geneva did not respond to Reuters' queries for comment. Pyongyang does not recognise the U.N. investigator's mandate and boycotted Wednesday's debate. 

It has previously rejected U.N. allegations of crimes against humanity.

LONDON (Reuters) - A ""revolution"" in technology that helped scientists develop COVID-19 vaccines in under a year must be sped up, so that when the next pandemic arrives a shot can be ready in 100 days, an international coalition said on Wednesday.
Launching a call for international donors to back a $3.5 billion five-year strategy to tackle future pandemic risks, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said the next emerging disease could be even worse than COVID-19.
Despite 2.5 million deaths from COVID-19 so far, ""We might not be so lucky next time,"" CEPI's chief executive Richard Hatchett told an online event.
""The COVID-19 pandemic is not the first pandemic of the 21st Century, and unless we act now, we can be sure that it will not be the last. There is nothing, nothing at all, to prevent the next emerging virus from being far more lethal.""Governments, global health organisations and other partners must make critical investments now in global health security and take advantage of ""the revolution in vaccinology that has been catalysed by COVID-19"".
He described the goal of having a platform that can be used to make a new vaccine within 100 days as ""our moonshot"".
""We must shave every day we can off every step of the process if we are to deliver on the promise of the science.""
Hatchett said that while the fast pace of COVID-19 vaccine development was unprecedented and ""a heroic achievement"", it was still ""not enough"". Some 68 million cases and 1.5 million deaths due to COVID-19 had been confirmed by the time the first shots were administered, he said. ""We must do better.""
To be able to squeeze vaccine development timelines down to 100 days, CEPI said, researchers and drug developers would need to exploit the capabilities of so-called rapid response platform technologies, such as the mRNA approach used in COVID-19 shots developed by Pfizer-BioNtech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
It would also involve working with global drugs regulators to streamline the requirements needed for vaccines to be approved, and linking-up manufacturing facilities to enable rapid production of pandemic vaccines.

CEPI, which was created in 2017 with initial donor funding from Germany, Japan and Norway and from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust global health charity, has played a key role in funding early development of a range of candidate vaccines against COVID-19.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Rakuten-owned messaging app Viber said on Wednesday they were reviewing recent advertisements run by a Myanmar military-backed telecommunications firm following the Feb. 1 coup.
The move comes as activists called on the technology giants to restrict access to the company's services after dozens of deaths following weeks of protests against the military's seizure of power.
Justice for Myanmar, an advocacy group looking at the army's business interests, said on Wednesday it had found that Google and Viber were running new advertisements for Mytel, a Myanmar telecoms company partially owned by the army, following a ban by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
More than 60 protesters have been killed and 1,900 people have been arrested since the coup, an advocacy group said.
Following the publication of the Reuters story, Viber said on Wednesday it was stopping all advertising in Myanmar temporarily.
""We are looking into the current situation to ensure all ads comply with guidelines,"" the company said in a tweet responding to Reuters, noting that during this ""analysis"", all advertising would be suspended.
""Viber continues to focus on the most important task - ensuring people in Myanmar continue to communicate freely and securely under the circumstances.""
Neither Mytel nor the Myanmar army responded to requests for comment. 
Google said it was reviewing the ads and had separately disabled some accounts connected to the military including those on Gmail, the publishing platform Blogger and the Google Play store.
""We have taken action against accounts on our platforms... including disabling accounts on Google services and taking down a number of YouTube channels and videos related to the Myanmar military,"" a Google spokeswoman said in a response to a Reuters question.
YouTube said last week it had taken down five channels run by the state network MRTV as well as the military-owned Myawaddy Media. 
""Our priority is to help people in Myanmar access information and communicate safely,"" the Google spokeswoman said. 
Justice for Myanmar representative Yadanar Maung said it was ""appalled"" if Google and Viber profited by selling advertisements for ""the Myanmar military business"" Mytel. 
Reuters reviewed three Mytel advertisements published on Google and Viber over the last week, soon after Facebook announced it would block the Myanmar army from access to its platforms as well as advertising by all army-linked military entities. [L4N2KV19W]
Facebook in 2020 removed more than a dozen user accounts and pages for ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour"". It said they were being used to covertly promote Mytel and disparage rivals. 
Documents published by Justice for Myanmar, whose website has been blocked by authorities in Myanmar, found that Mytel is under large control of the Myanmar military, for which it provides a significant source of income.

""The military's business interests help finance the brutal atrocities they are committing against the people of Myanmar,"" said Maung, who called on technology firms to ban all military businesses from its platforms.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Young Syrians have suffered heavy personal losses in a decade of war and still have to face rebuilding their shattered homeland, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Wednesday.
A new ICRC survey of 1,400 Syrian nationals living in Syria or in exile in Lebanon and Germany highlights the costs for those aged 18-25 of a war that killed hundreds of thousands, displaced millions more and destroyed schools and hospitals.
""One of the shocking results of this survey is that we realised that 50% of Syrians had friends or a family member who was killed... One out of six Syrians had one of their parents either killed or wounded,"" Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC’s regional director for the Middle East, told Reuters.
""Rebuilding the country is on their shoulders and obviously it's quite unfair,"" he said in an interview at its headquarters.
The report coincides with the 10th anniversary of the start of protests against President Bashar al-Assad's rule that turned into a full-scale civil war. Assad's military has now regained control of most of the country with Russian and Iranian help.
Nearly half of young Syrians have lost their income because of the conflict and almost eight in 10 have reported struggling to afford food and other necessities, the report showed. 
""Women have been particularly hard hit economically, with almost 30% in Syria reporting no income at all to support their family,"" the ICRC said.
'I TRY TO COMFORT THEM'
A video released by the ICRC with the survey shows 33-year-old Mouna Shawat using crutches to walk on one foot past blocks of bombed out buildings on streets full of rubble in the Syrian city of Aleppo before being fitted with a prosthetic device at its rehabilitation centre.
Shawat's lower left leg had to be amputated several years ago after an improvised explosive device blew up as she made her way home.
Shawat, who lives with her two children in Aleppo, recalls with nostalgia her youth before the civil war.
""We had everything - gas, diesel, services. Now we are cold and hungry, and we need to wait for gas to get warm. Sometimes we have to cook over a fire,"" she said.

Referring to her children's anxiety over her lost leg, she said: ""To this day, every time it comes up they start crying, I try to comfort them.""

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Tanzania's main opposition leader has demanded information on the health of President John Magufuli, a COVID-19 sceptic whose absence from public view in recent days brought speculation he was receiving medical treatment abroad.
There was no official statement on Magufuli's health. His director of communications Gerson Msigwa and government spokesman Hassan Abbas did not respond to Reuters messages left seeking comment. 
The Nation newspaper in neighbouring Kenya reported that an African leader who had not been seen in public for nearly two weeks was being treated for COVID-19 on a ventilator at Nairobi Hospital, a private hospital in the Kenyan capital.
It cited unidentified political and diplomatic sources for the report and did not identify the African leader. Reuters was not able to confirm the report independently. Kenya's Foreign Ministry and Nairobi Hospital both said they had no information to disclose.
Magufuli, a 61-year-old leader nicknamed ""The Bulldozer,"" was last seen in public on Feb. 27 looking his normal self as he swore in a new chief secretary at State House in Tanzania's commercial capital Dar es Salaam. He has been out of public view for periods in the past.
""The president's wellbeing is a matter of grave public concern. What's it with Magufuli that we don't deserve to know?"", opposition leader Tundu Lissu said in a tweet late on Tuesday as rumours flew on Tanzania's social media.
""It's a sad comment on his stewardship of our country that it's come to this: that he himself had get COVID-19 and be flown out to Kenya in order to prove that prayers, steam inhalations and other unproven herbal concoctions he’s championed are no protection against coronavirus!"" added Lissu, without providing evidence.
'VACCINES ARE NOT GOOD'
Magufuli has downplayed the threat of COVID-19 in Tanzania and scoffed at global panic. He urged Tanzanians to put faith in prayer and homespun remedies such as steam inhalation rather than vaccines, which he said were dangerous and part of a Western conspiracy.
""Vaccines are not good. If they were, then the white man would have brought vaccines for HIV/AIDS,"" he said earlier this year. Last year he dismissed coronavirus testing kits, which he said had returned positive results on a goat and pawpaw fruit. 
Tanzania stopped reporting coronavirus data in May last year when it said it had 509 cases and 21 deaths, according to data held at the World Health Organization, which has called on the country to share its information.
Fuelling concern about a possible hidden epidemic, a top opposition politician on Tanzania's autonomous Zanzibar archipelago, Seif Sharif Hamad, died last month of what his party said was COVID-19.
Even as COVID-19 spread around Africa, Tanzanians were still allowed to gather, for example to watch sport. 
Magufuli was first elected in 2015 and beat Lissu to win re-election last year. He has faced accusations from Western countries and opposition parties of eroding democracy, which he denies. 

Magufuli has a history of heart issues, according to a senior Tanzanian medic close to the government who asked not to be identified, and a private security official in Kenya with extensive official contacts in Tanzania.

In New York, the U.N. Security Council failed to agree on a statement that would have condemned the coup in Myanmar, called for restraint by the military and threatened to consider ""further measures"".
Talks on the statement would likely continue, diplomats said, after China, Russia, India and Vietnam all suggested amendments late on Tuesday to a British draft, including removal of the reference to a coup and the threat to consider further action.
More than 60 protesters have been killed and 1,900 people have been arrested in the turmoil in Myanmar since the Feb. 1 coup, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group, has said.
The military has brushed off condemnation of its actions, as it has in past periods of army rule when outbreaks of protest were forcibly repressed.
On Wednesday, Police stormed a compound in Yangon housing railway staff and surrounded hundreds of protesters in North Okkalapa district, in another part of the city. More than 100 people were arrested at the two sites, witnesses said.
Many of the railway staff are part of a civil disobedience movement that has crippled government business and included strikes at banks, factories and shops since the army ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government.
""We are seeing reports of innocent students and civilians surrounded by security forces in North Okkalapa, as well as arrests,"" the U.S. Embassy said in a statement.
""We call on those security forces to withdraw from the area, release those detained, and allow people to depart safely.""
Police and army officials did not respond to requests for comment.
On Tuesday, Zaw Myat Linn, an official from Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), died in custody after he was arrested, the second party figure to die in detention in two days.
""He's been participating continuously in the protests,"" said Ba Myo Thein, a member of the dissolved upper house of parliament. The cause of death was not clear. 
In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) live broadcast before he was detained, Zaw Myat Linn urged people to continue fighting the army, ""even if it costs our lives"".
CRACKDOWN ON MEDIA
Police on Tuesday also cracked down on independent media, raiding the offices of two news outlets and detaining two journalists.
At least 35 journalists have been arrested since the Feb. 1 coup, Myanmar Now reported, of which 19 have been released.
""It is grim, it is horrifying, and it is heart breaking,"" Thin Lei Win, the co-founder of the independent Myanmar Now said in an interview. ""Protesters as well as journalists are going out every single day wondering whether this is the last day that they are going to be doing their job. And I really fear that things will get worse before they get better.""
Meanwhile, after being banned from Facebook and YouTube, Myanmar state network MRTV, which is now controlled by the military, has moved to publishing videos on online platform Vimeo.
Since the account was created this month, the MRTV Vimeo channel has posted 141 news bulletins, including many announcements by the military leadership.
Neither Vimeo, MRTV, nor a spokesman for the army immediately responded to requests for comment. 
REFUSING ORDERS TO FIRE
Some police have refused orders to fire on unarmed protesters and have fled to neighbouring India, according to an interview with one officer and classified Indian police documents. 
""As the civil disobedience movement is gaining momentum and protest(s) held by anti-coup protesters at different places we are instructed to shoot at the protesters,"" four officers said in a joint statement to police in the Indian city of Mizoram.
""In such a scenario, we don't have the guts to shoot at our own people who are peaceful demonstrators,"" they said.
The United States is ""repulsed"" by the Myanmar army's continued use of lethal force against its people and is continuing to urge the military to exercise ""maximum restraint"", State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Tuesday.
The army has justified the coup by saying that a November election won by the NLD was marred by fraud - an assertion rejected by the electoral commission. It has promised a new election, but has not said when that might be held.
The junta has hired an Israeli-Canadian lobbyist for $2 million to ""assist in explaining the real situation"" of the army's coup to the United States and other countries, documents filed with the U.S. Justice Department show.

Ari Ben-Menashe and his firm, Dickens & Madson Canada, will represent Myanmar's military government in Washington, as well as lobby Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Israel and Russia, and international bodies such as the United Nations, according to a consultancy agreement.

LONDON (Reuters) - England's $32 billion test and trace system has not made a clear impact on the COVID-19 pandemic, the British parliament's Public Accounts Committee said on Wednesday, decrying the ""unimaginable"" costs of the programme.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson last year promised a world beating test and trace system as part of the route out of the pandemic. But it has taken the successful development and deployment of vaccines to let the government plot a definitive route back to normality.
""Despite the unimaginable resources thrown at this project, Test and Trace cannot point to a measurable difference to the progress of the pandemic,"" chair of the committee, opposition Labour party lawmaker Meg Hillier, said.
""The promise on which this huge expense was justified - avoiding another lockdown – has been broken, twice.""
The Public Accounts Committee said that test and trace had cost 23 billion pounds ($32 billion) so far but had not achieved a key goal of avoiding a cycle of national lockdowns.
The system has been allocated 37 billion pounds in total to cover two years, a budget which includes the cost of testing people with symptoms and regular testing in schools, care homes and some work places. 
Dido Harding, who runs the system, said that the team had carried out over 83 million coronavirus tests, more than any other comparable European country, and that testing still had a role to play in lifting lockdown.
""Test and trace is essential in our fight against COVID-19 and regular testing is a vital tool to stop transmission as we cautiously ease restrictions,"" she said, adding that contact tracing made ""a real impact in breaking chains of transmission"".
The committee's report said that test and trace was overly reliant on expensive contractors. Consultants working on the system cost 1,000 pounds a day. 
Last year, scientific advisers said test and trace was not significantly reducing the spread of the coronavirus. England then entered a second lockdown in the autumn. 
British minister Grant Shapps said on Wednesday the system had been set up from scratch, it was playing a critical role in helping stop the spread of new variants and the pandemic would have been ""one heck of a lot worse"" without it.

""Such measures, if introduced, would be a further attack on Hong Kong's rights and freedoms,"" Foreign Office minister Nigel Adams told lawmakers. ""The Chinese and Hong Kong authorities can be in no doubt about the seriousness of our concerns.""
China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), is expected on Thursday to approve a resolution that will reduce democratic representation in Hong Kong institutions and vet any candidates for ""patriotism"".
Adams said Britain would wait to see what the actual changes were before making its final assessment. 
He said he could not speculate on Magnitsky-style sanctions against individuals over China's actions in Hong Kong, but said that such measures remain under very close review. 
Britain has previously said it is considering Magnitsky sanctions because it judges that Beijing has broken the terms of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China.
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms that pro-democracy activists, who brought parts of the city to frequent halts in sometimes violent protests in 2019, say are being whittled away by Communist Party rulers in Beijing. China denies the accusation.

The parliament's approval of Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibeh's cabinet by 132 votes to two against, at a session in a war-battered frontline city, represents the biggest opportunity in years for a resolution to Libya's conflict. 
""Through this vote, it became clear that the Libyans are one unit,"" Dbeibeh told parliament afterwards. 
However, huge hurdles remain and the manner of Dbeibeh's own appointment and the size of his cabinet have drawn criticism in Libya with accusations of corruption and influence peddling that spoilers could leverage to deny his legitimacy. 
On the ground, Libya's streets, businesses and state institutions remain in the shadow of myriad armed factions and split between two rival administrations, while foreign powers backing either side have kept their guns in place. 
Amending the constitution and holding free elections in 2021 will be an immense challenge, though all sides have formally committed to do so.
""If we come out of this with one government and one set of institutions then we're already in a far superior place than we've been for the last five years,"" said Tarek Megerisi of the European Council on Foreign Relations. 
The parliament session was in Sirte, where front lines stabilised last summer after the Government of National Accord (GNA) pushed Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army back from Tripoli.
Both the GNA and the eastern administration welcomed the vote and said they were ready to hand power over to the new government. Parliament speaker Aguila Saleh said Dbeibeh's cabinet would be sworn in next week.
It was parliament's first full session in years after it split between eastern and western factions soon after being elected in 2014 - three years after an uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi plunged the oil-producing country into chaos.
A ceasefire has held since the autumn, but the main road across the front lines from Sirte to Misrata remains closed and lawmakers coming from the west had to fly in from Tripoli. 
Russia's Wagner mercenaries, sent to Libya to support Haftar and accused of lacing civilian areas with deadly booby traps when pulling out of Tripoli last year, remain entrenched around Sirte and other parts of the country. 
Haftar was also backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, while Turkey supported the GNA. Dbeibeh said on Tuesday that economic deals the GNA struck with Turkey should stand. 
POWER BROKERS
Critics of the process say it has merely rearranged the tangle of alliances and enmities among power brokers who have dominated Libya for years, without disrupting their ability to loot its wealth or spoil unfavourable settlements. 
They are also angry that the accusations of corruption in Dbeibeh's appointment have not been formally debated. He was chosen by the 75 members of a U.N. political forum that met in Tunis and Geneva and voted on leadership candidates. 
Some forum delegates said colleagues were offered money. Dbeibeh, along with three members of a presidency council also selected in Geneva, has promised not to seek further office in the election. 
Still, Libya stands on the cusp of a first unified government in years and with all sides formally committed to elections. 
On Tuesday, the first civilian airline flight in six years took place between the cities of Benghazi and Misrata - tangible evidence of detente. 

""It is good for us to have one government...but it is more important for the government to abide by the agreement and bring the country to elections,"" said Khaled Al-Ajili, 42, a businessman in a Tripoli cafe.

Ayuso's People's Party (PP) has governed Spain's wealthiest region in coalition with Aguado's centrist Ciudadanos since 2019, but long-standing tension between the two parties boiled over on Wednesday, threatening several jointly controlled regional authorities. 
The snap election will be held on May 4.
Aguado criticised Ayuso's sudden resignation and said he hoped she would reconsider. 
""It seems terribly reckless to us to call elections ... and open the door to instability that could cause the Madrid region to derail from a health, economic and social point of view,"" he told reporters.
Madrid's regional administration is in charge of health policy and is responsible for its own coronavirus response and vaccine rollout.
In southeastern Murcia, where the two parties also have a coalition, Ciudadanos sided with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists in bringing a no-confidence motion against regional leader Fernando Lopez Miras of the PP.
By publicly breaking ranks with the PP, Ciudadanos has raised the spectre of similar no-confidence votes in other regions where they rule in coalition, such as Andalusia and Castille and Leon. 
For now, Ciudadanos in Andalusia - Spain's most populous region - have said their pact is stable, while in Castille and Leon, both parties said it remains valid.
Widely viewed as a maverick, Ayuso has frequently clashed with the left-wing central government. Her administration imposed one of Spain's loosest curfews and has consistently refused to shut bars and restaurants, in defiance of national recommendations.

A government spokesperson did not comment on the specifics of the accusations in reponse to a detailed Reuters' query. The spokesperson said in a statement Bahrain takes the protection of human rights ""extremely seriously"" and had a ""zero-tolerance policy"" towards mistreatment within the justice system. 
A joint statement by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) said that around 13 children aged 11-17 were detained in early to mid-February as authorities tried to dissuade protesters from gathering to mark the 10th anniversary of the uprising.
""Five children, arrested on Feb. 14-15, said that police from the station beat, insulted, and threatened them with electric shocks from a car battery,"" the statement said, quoting the children and their families. 
""An officer hit a 13-year-old on his head and threatened to rape him, give him electric shocks, and beat his genitals.""
The rights groups' statement said Bahraini police in some cases arrested children for allegedly burning tires or blocking a road on the day of their arrest. It said police also accused children of vandalism, planting a fake bomb and throwing petrol bombs in November 2020.
Four of the children remain in detention, including a 16-year-old with a serious medical condition, HRW and BIRD said.
The Bahrain government spokesperson also said the Gulf Arab country's criminal justice system, when dealing with people under age 18, makes decisions based on considerations of ""each individual child's best interests, as well as their rehabilitation and place in society"".
Bahrain's U.S.-backed, Sunni Muslim monarchy suppressed the uprising, led mostly by members of the Shi'ite Muslim majority, by force in 2011 and cracked down hard on sporadic unrest and dissent afterwards. It was the only Gulf state to experience one of the ""Arab Spring"" uprisings a decade ago. 
Mass trials followed and thousands of people were imprisoned and many others fled abroad. Bahrain has since seen sporadic clashes between protesters and security forces, who have been targeted by bomb attacks.
Rights groups including Amnesty International have criticised the kingdom’s lack of an independent judiciary and accused its security forces of committing torture and other forms of ill-treatment with impunity. The government denies the charges.

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - Jury selection was due to continue for a second day on Wednesday in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former policeman facing criminal charges for his role in the death of George Floyd during an arrest that caused an outcry around the world.
Judge Peter Cahill of the Hennepin County District Court has set aside three weeks to screen jurors, aware that most people have heard of Chauvin and even seen the bystander's video showing him with his knee on the dying Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes.
Three jurors were seated on Tuesday after saying they could put aside their misgivings about Chauvin: a white man who is a chemist at an environmental testing lab; a woman who appeared to be of mixed race who said she was ""super excited"" to serve on a jury; and a white man who works as an auditor.
The trial on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges is seen as a landmark case on police violence against Black people in the United States, a country where police officers are rarely found to be criminally responsible for killing civilians. 
Chauvin, 44, is white, and Floyd, who was being arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes, was a 46-year-old Black man who grew up in Houston before moving to Minneapolis.
Prosecutors say Chauvin should face an additional charge of third-degree murder over the objections of Chauvin's defense lawyers, a dispute that is being hashed out in appeals courts while the District Court presses ahead with jury selection.
Chauvin and the three other officers who made the arrest were fired from the Minneapolis Police Department the day after Floyd's death, which was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner. Chauvin's lawyers say he stuck to his police training and did not use excessive force. The three other former police officers involved are to go on trial on charges of aiding and abetting Chauvin later this year.

Chauvin was released from jail on a $1 million bond last October and is being tried in a courtroom in the Hennepin County Government Center, a tower in downtown Minneapolis now ringed with barbed-wire fencing and concrete barricades. Protesters chanted anti-racism slogans and blocked traffic on Monday, but few appeared in the largely deserted downtown streets on Tuesday.

Solar Foods has received nearly 25 million euros ($30 million) in government and private funding to commercialise the product called Solein, a yellow flour-type ingredient containing some 65 percent protein manufactured in a miniature bioreactor inside a laboratory.
The flour is ground from a liquid microorganism that is made out of carbon dioxide from air, electricity, water, microbes and nutrients.
However, the company faces challenges, said Reetta Kivela, a professor of practice for food innovations at the University of Helsinki.
To make Solein a success, Kivela said, the company needed to make production run on renewable energy, find a sustainable way to produce nitrogen and make the flour more appealing than some other vegetable proteins that often have a grainy texture and can taste bitter.
Solar Foods Chief Executive Pasi Vainikka said that even though Solein used ammonia produced with fossil energy, it already produced significantly less emissions than meat production. The company is also planning to shift to green ammonia or even produce it at its own factory.
In December, the company added 4.3 million euros from the Finnish government to funding earlier raised from private investment companies and Finnish baker and candy maker Fazer to commercialise Solein.
Preparing to scale up manufacturing with a small demo factory, Solar Foods aims to introduce the product to the market in early 2023 and is applying for novel food approval globally, Vainikka told Reuters.

There are thousands of emails to sort through and phone calls to field, supplies to organize, appointments to schedule. 
Amin, known as Dr. Mak, set up a vaccination clinic on Super Bowl Sunday at the local firehouse that drew more than 1,000 people who kept their appointments for shots despite the snow that day.
""It was just like a party out there,"" Amin, 36, recalled during an interview with Reuters in late February. ""It was something you could have never imagined in your life, to see four strangers carrying somebody on a wheelchair to get them through the mud and into the building."" 
Thanks to deep ties with their communities and the trust they have been able to establish over the years, some local pharmacists are instrumental in reaching people who might be reluctant to get vaccinated or may not know about vaccination efforts, said Jennifer Kates, the director of global health and HIV policy at Kaiser Family Foundation.
""Those local pharmacies are a really important trusted voice,"" Kates said. 
The vaccine rollout, which the administration of former President Donald Trump left to the states to carry out without a federal blueprint or sufficient funding, has proven to be choppy. Under President Joe Biden supply has increased but some distribution and access hurdles persist. 
Montgomery County, where Schwenksville is located, has one of the highest per capita vaccination rates in the state, according to the state health department website. Pennsylvania ranks 28 out of 50 states with 18% of residents getting at least one shot, according to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention. (https://tmsnrt.rs/2WTOZDR)
SURPRISE SHOT
On a gray Saturday morning in late February, Amin slipped into a Superman costume, the remnant of Halloweens past that he now sometimes wears for vaccinations, and drove through the frozen suburbs to deliver two COVID-19 vaccines to home-bound patients. 
""What a surprise!"" 74-year-old on Gail Bertsch said after Amin and a few volunteers, whom she had not been expecting, knocked on her door. She and her husband James, who suffers from dementia, both got injections. 
""I can't believe we can actually have this done,"" she said.
Amin has also vaccinated people by appointment at his pharmacy, including holding a special clinic for pregnant women and another one for children with underlying health conditions. 
Among them was the pharmacist's nephew, who suffers from neurofibromatosis, a condition that causes tumors to form in the brain, nerves, and other parts of the body. 
Some 3,000 people have received first shots of both  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer-BioNTech through Skippack Pharmacy since early February, Amin said. Among some 1,000 residents who received second doses over the weekend were Chester and Martha Pish, 97 and 98 years old respectively, who have been married 78 years. 
The effort has been all-consuming for Amin, and riddled with hurdles, including organizing vaccine stocks – which sometimes arrive at a few hours' notice, a side effect of the supply chain hiccups that are among the problems that have plagued the rollout. 
The young pharmacist reunites with his pregnant wife only on weekends as a health precaution and spends the week at his parents' home in Lansdale. The couple will welcome their first child in May. 
""I want to be there when my child is born, and I want to make sure that all my people are vaccinated by then,"" he told Reuters. ""If I can, that would be my dream."" 
COME TOGETHER
Pandemic hardship and now the drive to get shots into people’s arms have united his Montgomery County community behind the young pharmacist.
On a recent Friday, five volunteers converged in the back of the store. They filled spreadsheets with patients' contact information and checked the inventory of vaccination supplies. 
Amin has just one other full-time employee, Jacquelyn Ziegler, and two pharmacy student interns, Erica Mabry and Isabelle Lawler. But he can count on dozens of volunteers, including family members, to answer the phone and help less tech-savvy patients navigate the online system to book a COVID-19 vaccine appointment. 
""It's just incredible how everyone has kind of like filtered into this one space,"" said event planner Courtney Marengo, one of Amin's volunteers. 
Amin said he did not set out to own a pharmacy. But he moved to fill a void left when Skippack, a 50-year-old local institution, was bought out by national giant CVS in 2018. The chain acquired Skippack Pharmacy's assets but left it shuttered. Amin bought the pharmacy from CVS before the pandemic in hopes of keeping the resource in the community.

""I feel like sometimes things fall into your lap at certain points in your life,"" he said. ""You might not have planned for it to happen, but things happen for the right reason.""

Goldmine': film alleging Belarusian leader has gilded life gets 3 million views online,"(Reuters) - A film accusing Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on gilded residences, planes and Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) and Maybach cars has gained more than 3 million YouTube views since its release on Monday. 
The film by the Poland-based opposition news service NEXTA was released as opposition activists gear up for a new round of protests against last year's reelection of Lukashenko, who has ruled for 27 years and calls himself ""the people's president"".
It echoes a video released by allies of poisoned Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny after his jailing which fuelled mass protests in Russia earlier this year. It showed a palace it said was owned by President Vladimir Putin; the Kremlin said it did not belong to him.
The Belarusian authorities have not commented since the film's release but Lukashenko last week accused his opponents of preparing a fake story in order to destabilise the former Soviet republic - a close Russia ally. 
""I want you to understand: I have been working as president for a quarter of a century, and if there were already some billions, as they say, or palaces, I would have already been torn to pieces from all sides,"" he said during a factory visit. 
""I did not steal anything from my state, I did not take anything.""
The mass protests that erupted last August over an election that his opponents say was blatantly rigged represent the biggest challenge to Lukashenko's rule. They dwindled after a fierce crackdown but opposition leaders aim to restart them soon.
A former Soviet collective farm manager, Lukashenko is often seen driving tractors, visiting factories and playing ice hockey to promote his image as a man of the people and has suggested vodka and saunas as a treatment for coronavirus.
The film, titled ""Lukashenko. Goldmine"", sparked many comment and jokes on social media, but is more likely to change mindsets outside of Belarus than within, where opinion is now firmly divided, said political analyst Valery Karbalevich.
""The overwhelming majority of the Belarusian society has already determined its attitude to the authorities,"" he said.
NEXTA founder Stsiapan Putsila alleged Lukashenko's Independence Palace in Minsk cost the state budget $250 million and said he had 17 more residences around the country. Lukashenko previously said his cars were gifts from businessmen. 
""In fact, the image of the people's president was destroyed much earlier ... the Robin Hood image, an unselfish fighter against corruption, has long been dispelled,"" said political analyst Alexander Klaskovsky.

""The purpose of the film is to stir up protest activity.""

LIMA (Reuters) - George Forsyth, a former professional soccer goalkeeper, is targeting Peru's angry youth to help his candidacy at presidential elections next month, pledging to turn the page on decades of corruption scandals in the copper-rich Andean nation.
Forsyth, whose mother is a former Miss Chile and father is Peru's ambassador to Japan, is among the front-runners for the April 11 ballot though the field is split and many voters are undecided.
The 38-year-old conservative has vowed to maintain macroeconomic stability, but also wants to curb social unrest around resource extraction by creating a ""mining trust"" to ensure royalties uplift local communities.
Peru's younger generations have had enough of the cycles of corruption that have hit politicians in the world's No. 2 two copper producer, he told Reuters at his campaign office in the upscale neighborhood of Miraflores in the capital Lima.
""My youth is a plus point, I have the energy and the drive, and I represent a fed-up generation that no longer believes in politicians,"" said Forsyth, who often sports jeans and t-shirts.
""That 'sameocracy,' those old-school politicians, are afraid of us,"" he added.
Forsyth played for Peruvian championship-winning team Alianza Lima, Peru's national squad and as a reserve for Borussia Dortmund in Germany. He took up politics at a local level in 2010.
Fighting corruption is one of his main themes. Five former Peruvian presidents have been investigated or prosecuted for corruption in just over two decades while another committed suicide to avoid arrest over money laundering investigations. 
Last year, then President Martin Vizcarra was removed from office by Congress over allegations of graft, as yet unproven. His replacement resigned less than a week later amid angry protests and another interim leader took office.
Forsyth, from the conservative National Victory party, led the presidential race in polls last year but in a fractured election he is now vying with candidates such as populist legislator Yonhy Lescano, who on Tuesday registered a lead in the latest poll, and ultra-conservative businessman Rafael Lopez Aliaga, seen as Peru's version of Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro.
Analysts say the socially-liberal Forsyth faces a battle to remain in the top two until the April election, before a likely June 6 second round run-off.
""Voters are really fickle in Peru and they are now starting to look around at who stands the best chance of winning at this point,"" said political scientist Fernando Tuesta.
'JUST A PRETTY FACE'
Ipsos Peru and Institute of Peruvian Studies see support for the top four candidates ranging between 8.1% and 11.3%, but also highlight that with just five weeks to go until the election almost a third of voters remain undecided. 
Detractors of Forsyth - who was the mayor of a populous Lima district - have nicknamed him ""Ken"", after Barbie's muscle-bound boyfriend, and say he lacks of experience to steady the ship after a turbulent year of pandemic and politics.
""He's just a pretty face but he's not ready,"" said office worker Ruben Berrocal, 45. ""What Peru needs is a president with wisdom to get us out of this crisis.""
Forsyth says however that he is exactly what Peru needs to reverse a 11% drop in its 2020 Gross Domestic Product, the worst in three decades, and restore faith in politics.
""The most important thing today is to generate a climate of stability, of trust,"" he said.
Key to achieving those goals is the curbing of recurring social conflicts, mainly against the exploitation of natural resources whose benefits he says do not filter down enough the communities around them.
He proposes creating a ""mining trust"" funded by 20% of all the royalties and rights paid by the firms in the sector which would be jointly managed by those miners, the communities and the State.
""That way you generate a pot managed by those three actors and guarantee the development specifically of the affected communities,"" he said.
He told Reuters he will also create a Ministry of Infrastructure to unlock large projects to generate up to 1.5 million short-term jobs to help the post-pandemic recovery.
His message of breaking with the past holds most resonance with Peru's youth, who led protests last year.

""He represents a new page, he isn't contaminated,"" said Rossy Malpartida, a 32-year-old woman selling soft drinks in the street, who said she would vote for him.

898,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 07:16AM ET</span>",Exclusive: 'Migrant president' Biden stirs Mexican angst over boom time for gangs,"By Dave Graham (NYSE:GHM)
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's government is worried the new U.S. administration's asylum policies are stoking illegal immigration and creating business for organized crime, according to officials and internal assessments seen by Reuters.
Ever since President Joe Biden won the White House vowing to undo the hardline approach of his predecessor Donald Trump, Mexico has both looked forward to an end to migration burdens imposed by Trump, and braced for a new influx of people.
Detentions on the U.S border have surged since Biden took office on Jan. 20. Mexico has urged Washington to help stem the flow by providing development aid to Central America, from where most migrants come, driven by a humanitarian crisis.
""They see him as the migrant president, and so many feel they're going to reach the United States,"" Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said of Biden the morning after a virtual meeting with his U.S. counterpart on March 1.
""We need to work together to regulate the flow, because this business can't be tackled from one day to the next.""
Previously unreported details in the internal assessments, based on testimonies and intelligence gathering, state that gangs are diversifying methods of smuggling and winning clients as they eye U.S. measures that will ""incentivize migration.""
Apprehensions on the U.S.-Mexico border in February hit levels unseen since mid-2019, and were the highest for that month in 15 years, data reported by Reuters showed.
Among U.S. steps Mexico worries are encouraging migration are improved support for victims of gangs and violence, streamlining of the legalization process, and suspension of Trump-era accords that deported people to Central America.
Recent Mexican policies are also encouraging migration, according to one assessment. It saw potential fillips in measures such as offering COVID-19 vaccines to migrants, as well as better protections for undocumented children.
One Mexican official familiar with migration developments, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said organized crime began changing its modus operandi ""from the day Biden took office"" and now exhibited ""unprecedented"" levels of sophistication.
That includes briefing clients on the latest immigration rules, using technology to outfox authorities, and disguising smuggling operations as travel agencies, assessments showed.
""Migrants have become a commodity,"" the official said, arguing they were now as valuable as drugs for the gangs. ""But if a packet of drugs is lost in the sea, it's gone. If migrants are lost, it's human beings we're talking about.""
Mexico's security ministry, foreign ministry and national migration institute did not reply to requests for comment for this story. The White House and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Higher concentrations of migrants in border areas have encouraged gangs to recruit some as drug mules, and kidnap others for money, said Cesar Peniche, attorney general of Chihuahua, the state with the longest stretch of U.S. frontier.
Both Mexican and U.S. policy should be more clear-cut so as not to spur illegal immigration, he told Reuters.
Mexico has praised Biden for offering a pathway to citizenship to millions of U.S. residents of Mexican origin, and for rolling back Trump-era policies that sent U.S. asylum seekers back into Mexico to await their court hearings.
SOCIAL MEDIA
To avoid detection, migrants now often travel in small groups instead of caravans, and increasingly follow more dangerous, less well-trodden routes, the Mexican official said.
Communicating via social media such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), WhatsApp, Instagram and YouTube, smugglers update migrants on impending checkpoints, when freight trains they can jump on pass, where to stay and how to navigate immigration laws, the official added.
To ease their passage, smugglers advise Central American clients to register complaints with authorities saying they have been victims of extortion or, for young men, that they have faced death threats from street gangs, the assessments show.
And, as in previous years, migrants are being told to bring along children to make it easier to apply for asylum.
Mexican intelligence shows smugglers' transit costs vary widely. One assessment said an unaccompanied Central American minor could secure passage to the U.S. border for about $3,250. By contrast, for African travelers, the rate was $20,000. Asians must also pay more.
One evaluation set out concerns there could be a significant influx in migrants from outside the region - the Caribbean, Asia, Africa and the Middle East - as coronavirus-led border restrictions begin easing.
Even as Mexicans hail Biden's cancellation of work on Trump's border wall, some officials say it is time Mexico returns to an idea the government raised in 2019: improving the infrastructure along its own southern border with Guatemala.

""Mexico spends more on every new wave of migrants than that would cost,"" said another official. ""We have to do it.""

899,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>",Germany's Laschet faces key electoral test on road to chancellery,"By Paul Carrel and Andreas Rinke
BERLIN (Reuters) - A face mask procurement scandal is raising concerns among Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU) that they could lose power in a key state government after an election on Sunday, harming party leader Armin Laschet's hopes of becoming chancellor.
The vote in the southwestern Baden-Wuerttemberg region poses an awkward test for Laschet before September's federal election when he hopes to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is stepping down after 16 years at the helm.
Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to Germany's car industry, was once safe CDU turf. But now the CDU risks losing its place as the Greens' junior ruling partner to an alliance of Greens, Social Democrats (SPD) and liberal Free Democrats - dubbed a 'traffic light' coalition after their party colours.
An election will also take place on Sunday in the neighbouring state of Rhineland-Palatinate, where such a 'traffic light' coalition already governs.
CDU support has been slipping in both states, and party officials worry it has been hit further after a CDU lawmaker from Baden-Wuerttemberg said on Monday he would quit over payments he received for brokering face mask procurement deals for local authorities.
CDU leaders fear that if a traffic light alliance ousts them from government in Baden-Wuerttemberg, then such a tie-up could gain credibility at September's federal vote - and could leave the party in opposition at national level.
Sunday's elections will also have ramifications within the conservative bloc, which runs Germany's federal government in coalition with the centre-left SPD.
BAVARIAN RIVAL
Laschet took pole position in the race to succeed Merkel by winning the CDU leadership two months ago, but a loss in Baden-Wuerttemberg could help his Bavarian rival Markus Soeder in their contest to be the conservative chancellor candidate.
""If the CDU is hit badly and fails to even enter into government in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Soeder could get in the door to replace Merkel as chancellor,"" said Naz Masraff at Eurasia, a political risk consultancy.
Soeder, the burly, confident leader of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), is the preferred conservative candidate for chancellor among German voters. He senses a unique chance to assert himself as a conservative unifier.
Soeder has said the election in Baden-Wuerttemberg, where the CDU lead candidate did not back Laschet for party leader, will have little bearing on the choice of chancellor candidate to represent the CDU/CSU alliance, dubbed 'the Union'.
Soeder and Laschet want to settle the candidacy matter by May 23. No German chancellor has ever come from the CSU.
Laschet is not taking any chances.
He has sought to dispel lingering concerns in the party that he could be a weak leader, ripping into his Social Democrat rival for the chancellery, Olaf Scholz, whom he accused of ""arrogance and ignorance in the middle of the pandemic"".
A survey by pollster Forschungsgruppe Wahlen for broadcaster ZDF published on Friday put the Greens in Baden-Wuerttemberg on 35% support, ahead of the CDU on 24%. In Rhineland-Palatinate, the Social Democrats led on 33%, ahead of the CDU on 29%.
CDU officials in Baden-Wuerttemberg say privately they would only stand a chance of winning the state if the Greens' popular premier, Winfried Kretschmann, who came to power in 2011 after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, was not running again.
For the Greens, the prospect of a third term running Baden-Wuerttemberg is a chance to stake a claim for the chancellery in September, though they lag the CDU/CSU nationally in polls.

""The message from an election victory in Baden-Wuerttemberg would be: We can beat the Union,"" Green Party national director Michael Kellner told Reuters.

LAJOSMIZSE, Hungary (Reuters) - With spring and COVID-19 vaccines within sight, Hungarian confectioner Laszlo Rimoczi is sending a message of hope for Easter by creating chocolate bunnies holding vaccine syringes.
Rimoczi said the vaccines, made of fine Italian chocolate and sprinkled with silver food colouring powder, signalled there was a way out of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Unlike his Christmas chocolate Santas, Rimoczi's bunnies no longer wear masks.
""There is no filling in the vaccines at all, it is just a 100% good quality Italian milk or dark chocolate,"" Rimoczi said as he moulded the chocolate vaccines in his small workshop in Lajosmizse, 70 km (45 miles) south of Budapest.
Rimoczi's business - he makes chocolate delicacies and sells them in a small shop in his house - suffered losses as the pandemic hit last year. His biggest hit yet were the masked Santas.
""For those who think ... I will ruin the good mood of children at Easter, I can do bunnies without vaccines as an alternative,"" Rimoczi added.

Rimoczi has registered in the government's vaccination programme and is looking forward to getting his real COVID-19 jab but is awaiting his call up from his family doctor.

The decision by the Kuala Lumpur High Court, which was confirmed by a lawyer in the case and reported by media, including national news agency Bernama, was part of a case brought by Jill Ireland, a Malaysian Christian, who sought a declaration that her constitutional rights had been violated. 
Authorities in 2008 seized Malay-language religious books and compact discs from Ireland at Kuala Lumpur airport, based on a 1986 home ministry directive banning Malay-language Christian publications from using the word ""Allah"".
Many Malay-speaking Christians say the word has been used in the country for centuries, particularly on Malaysia's side of Borneo island. Ireland is Melanau, an indigenous ethnic group from Sarawak state on Borneo. 
The court on Wednesday declared that the constitution granted Ireland equality before the law and that she was entitled to import the publications in the exercise of her rights to education and to practice religion, her lawyer Annou Xavier told Reuters.
""The court also declared that the 1986 directive by the Home Ministry... was unlawful and unconstitutional,"" Xavier said.
The High Court's judgment was not immediately available to media. 
Home Ministry officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Malaysia's highest court in 2015 had an appeal by the Catholic Church to use ""Allah"" in a Christian publication, after a previous tribunal ruled the word was exclusive to majority Malay Muslims. Christians make up about 9% of Malaysia's population, according to a 2010 census.

The court said Wednesday's decision did not contradict the 2015 ruling, however, as it concerned an individual's constitutional rights rather than matters surrounding publishing, according to Xavier.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea has agreed to a 13.9% increase in its contribution to the cost of hosting some 28,500 U.S. troops for 2021, the biggest annual rise in nearly two decades after U.S. calls for greater funding.
The increase will take South Korea's contribution this year to 1.18 trillion won ($1.03 billion). Former U.S. President Donald Trump had accused South Korea of ""free-riding"" on U.S. military might and demanded that it pay as much as $5 billion a year.
""The agreement resolved the longest-ever vacuum that had lasted about a year and three months,"" South Korea's chief negotiator, Jeong Eun-bo, told a televised briefing. 
""It provided a chance to reaffirm the importance of the alliance and the need for stable stationing of U.S. Forces Korea.""
The six-year Special Measures Agreement with the United States came after drawn-out negotiations and will boost South Korea's annual contribution to the bill for 2022 to 2025 in line with its annual defence budget increase, which was 5.4% this year, the foreign ministry said in a statement. 
The pact replaces an arrangement that expired at the end of 2019, under which South Korea paid about $920 million a year. Both sides agreed to freeze South Korea's contribution for 2020, the ministry said. 
In the last big increase in its contribution, South Korea in 2003 paid 17% more than the previous year, according to data from a defence ministry white paper.
On the new link between the contribution to the cost of maintaining U.S. forces and the defence budget, the ministry said the increase in the defence budget was a ""reasonable, verifiable indicator"" that reflected financial and security capabilities.
But Shin Beom-chul, a security expert at the Research Institute for Economy and Society in Seoul, said aligning the two issues was a ""mistake"" for South Korea, one of the world's largest defence spenders, and it could bring budget pressure. 
About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to help defend it against North Korea under a treaty of mutual defence signed after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. 
The treaty provided the basis for the stationing of U.S. forces in South Korea, which began paying towards their costs in the early 1990s after rebuilding its war-devastated economy. 
With negotiations making little headway after the last pact expired, about half of some 9,000 South Koreans working for the U.S. military were placed on unpaid leave, prompting the two sides to scramble for a stopgap deal to bring them back to work.
Jeong said the accord stipulated that in future, workers can be get their existing salaries in the absence of a new deal. 
The workers' union welcomed the agreement, saying it would help ensure stable work conditions. Without it, thousands more workers would have been forced to take unpaid leave next month, the union said.

Sarah Everard was last seen at 2130 GMT on Wednesday, March 3, when she walked home from a friend's house in south London. 
Police said the officer remained in custody and that he had not been on duty the night she disappeared. A woman was also arrested at the same location on suspicion of assisting an offender.

""We will continue to work with all speed on this investigation but the fact that the arrested man is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing.""
Police have launched an extensive investigation to find Everard, with officers searching streets and nearby areas on her route home, that went near the large grassy Clapham Common area.
Police and the family have released a number of photos of the woman, taken on the evening by CCTV cameras and on previous occasions, in the hope that someone will remember seeing her.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis condemned weapons manufacturers and traffickers for selling arms to ""terrorists"" in comments on Wednesday reflecting on his recent trip to Iraq.
He said he was grateful to have been able to make a visit that eluded his predecessors and described it as a ""sign of hope after years of war and terrorism and during a harsh pandemic"" for both Christians and Muslims.
""The Iraqi people have a right to live in peace, they have a right to rediscover the dignity that belongs to them,"" he said in his weekly Vatican audience, held online due to COVID-19.
Iraq suffers from chronic mismanagement, corruption and a steady level of violence often linked to rivalry between Iran and the United States in the region 18 years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq.
On Sunday the 84-year-old pope saw ruins of homes and churches in the northern city of Mosul that was occupied by Islamic State from 2014 to 2017.
""And I asked myself (during the trip), 'who sold the weapons to the terrorists?, who sells weapons to terrorists today who are carrying out massacres elsewhere, for example, in Africa?,'"" he said, departing from his prepared address.
""It is a question that I would like someone to answer.""
Francis has said in the past that weapons manufacturers and traffickers would have to answer to God one day.
Calling for fraternity throughout the world, he described his meeting on Saturday in the holy city of Najaf with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, one of the most influential figures in Shi’ite Islam, both within Iraq and beyond, ""unforgettable"".
He said he felt compelled to make the visit to Iraq, which saw the tightest security ever for a papal trip, to be close to ""that martyred people, that martyred Church"".
Iraq's Christian community, one of the oldest in the world,fell to about 300,000 from about 1.5 million before the U.S. invasion and the Islamist militant violence that followed.
Hours after the pope left on Monday, Iraq's prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi urged rival political groups to use dialogue to solve their differences, a move he said would reflect the ""love and tolerance"" shown by the pope.

Many in Iraq hope the papal visit will garner more international support for Kadhimi's government to handle sensitive crises, including reining in Iran-backed militias whose power and influence Kadhimi has sought to curb since taking office in May 2020.

""Let's hope the sentence has been changed or modified a little bit. We will see how it goes,"" Hathloul, 31, told reporters outside Riyadh's Special Criminal Court before entering for a second session regarding her appeal.
Hathloul, who championed women's right to drive and for an end to Saudi's male guardianship system, was detained in May 2018 and sentenced under broad cybercrime and counterterrorism laws in December to nearly six years in prison on charges that United Nations rights experts called spurious. 
The court suspended two years and 10 months of her sentence, most of which had already been served. Hathloul remains under a five-year travel ban.
Hathloul rose to prominence in 2013 when she began publicly campaigning for women’s right to drive in Saudi Arabia.
She was arrested for the first time in 2014 while attempting to drive across the border from the United Arab Emirates - where she had a valid driver’s licence - to Saudi Arabia.
She spent 73 days in a women’s detention facility, an experience she later said helped shape her campaigning against the kingdom’s male guardianship system.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, which has taken a tough stance over Saudi Arabia's human rights record, had urged Riyadh to release political prisoners including women's rights activists.

Saudi authorities released two activists with U.S. citizenship on bail in February pending trials on terrorism-related charges In January, a Saudi appeals court nearly halved a six-year prison sentence for a U.S.-Saudi physician and suspended the rest, meaning he did not have to return to jail.

""As a result of the tragic accidents and violations that took place units of the army started this morning opening closed roads,"" a statement posted on the official Twitter page of the Lebanese army said. 
President Michel Aoun had asked the army and security forces to clear the obstructions on Monday after a meeting with top officials.
Lebanon's financial crisis, which erupted in 2019, has wiped out jobs, locked people out of their bank deposits and raised the risk of widespread hunger.
Groups of protesters have been burning tyres daily to block roads since the Lebanese currency tumbled to a new low last week, deepening popular anger over the country's financial collapse.
Three people died in car accidents amidst the roadblocks on Monday including two young men who died when they drove into a truck that was parked across a road to block traffic. 
The incident prompted Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai, the country's top Christian cleric, to caution against chaotic road blocks.

In a sermon, he assured demonstrators that he stood by them and felt their pain but that people on the road are not the cause of the country's problems and should not be the ones who are punished.

908,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 11:35PM ET</span>","Ten years after disaster, Fukushima's 'singing' pottery comes home","By Elaine Lies and Akira Tomoshige
NAMIE, Japan (Reuters) - Toshiharu Onoda, a thirteenth-generation potter living in a town close to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, had just finished loading his kiln on March 11, 2011, when the massive earthquake struck.
Clinging to a wall as the room filled with choking dust, Onoda watched stunned as his two-tonne kiln began to move across the floor.
""Things were smashing all over the place, the kiln was clattering, everything inside just shattered,"" he said in the dusty ruins of his studio in Namie, built roughly a century ago.
Even in that dramatic moment, Onoda thought the danger would pass and he would continue at his studio.
""I didn't imagine I'd never work there again. I expected to start cleaning up the next morning,"" he said ruefully.
Instead, Onoda and nearly two dozen other potters were forced to evacuate within hours after reactor buildings at the plant owned by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) exploded, spewing radiation across the area where they'd lived and worked for over 300 years.
Now, with restrictions relaxed, Onoda and the potters in the group he heads have been able to come back to downtown Namie to a new showroom and workspace complete with kilns, which opens in 10 days. 
""If we don't make it in Namie, it's not really Oborisoma-yaki,"" said Onoda, his thick-fingered hands faintly dusted with clay, of the unique pottery known for the high-pitched singing sound made when kilns are opened and the glaze cracks.
Though Namie in name, very little about the pottery or the process remains the same. Some 80% of the town in the Fukushima prefecture is still out of bounds due to high radiation and half the Namie potters have quit. The valley that was their base, echoing with the call of whippoorwills, remains off limits as well. 
Even the clay and glaze used to give their wares a distinctive blue-green sheen are unavailable since the materials used to make it can no longer be gathered from the valley and processed there.
""It's not quite the same,"" Onada said of the clay he now uses, sourced from central Japan. The glaze, chemically recreated through over 100 experiments by Fukushima scientists, isn't quite the same colour either.
Onoda has been able to return and visit his house and studio, though the buildings are too damaged from weather and wild boars to be repaired. He won't go there alone because it makes him depressed. 
Instead, he and the town have their hopes pinned on the gleaming new building in the centre of Namie where the nine remaining potters will sell their wares, teach, and fire their work in kilns.
""Having a place for the potters to maintain their connection and community is essential,"" said town official Yuichi Konno.
""This pottery is an important part of Namie's heart.""
Onoda sees the new centre as a way of keeping the tradition alive, but he still dreams of having his own studio in Namie once again.

""I want to be somewhere here in Namie, somehow,"" he said. ""In Namie, there's scenery I know. It's easier to relax.""

909,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 11:20PM ET</span>",Lobbyist to be paid $2 million to 'explain' Myanmar's coup on behalf of junta,"By Simon Lewis
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An Israeli-Canadian lobbyist hired by Myanmar's junta will be paid $2 million to ""assist in explaining the real situation"" of the army's coup to the United States and other countries, documents filed with the U.S. Justice Department show.
More than 60 protesters have been killed and 1,900 people have been arrested since Feb. 1, when Myanmar's generals seized power and detained civilian leaders including State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi.
Ari Ben-Menashe and his firm, Dickens & Madson Canada, will represent Myanmar's military government in Washington, as well as lobby Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Israel and Russia, and international bodies like the United Nations, according to a consultancy agreement.
The Montreal-based firm will ""assist the devising and execution of policies for the beneficial development of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, and also to assist in explaining the real situation in the Country,"" read the agreement, submitted on Monday to the Justice Department as part of compliance with the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act and published online.
A spokesman for the Myanmar military government did not answer telephone calls from Reuters seeking comment.
In a pitch that has been met with widespread skepticism, Ben-Menashe told Reuters he had been tasked with convincing the United States that Myanmar's generals wanted to move closer to the West and away from China. He said the generals wanted to resettle Rohingya Muslims who fled a 2017 military assault for which the United Nations has accused those same generals of overseeing a genocide.
""It is highly implausible that he could convince the United States of the narrative he’s proposing,"" said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. 
Other documents submitted by Ben-Menashe showed the agreement was reached with the junta's defense minister, General Mya Tun Oo and that the government would pay the firm $2 million.
Mya Tun Oo and other top generals have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Canadian government, so the paperwork says the payment will be made ""when legally permissible.""
Lawyers told Reuters that Ben-Menashe could be in breach of sanctions. 
“To the extent that he is providing services to sanctioned parties from the United States without authorization, that would appear to be a violation of U.S. law,” said Peter Kucik, a former senior sanctions adviser at the U.S. Treasury.
The U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment.
Ben-Menashe told Reuters he had received legal advice that he would need licenses from Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC) and the Canadian government to accept the payment, but that he would not be breaking the law by lobbying for the junta. 

""There's technicalities here but we'll leave it to the lawyers and OFAC to deal with it,"" he said, adding his lawyers were in touch with Treasury officials.

910,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 09:51PM ET</span>",Saddened Queen Elizabeth will address Harry and Meghan's racism accusation,"By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth said on Tuesday the British royals were saddened by the challenging experiences of her grandson Prince Harry and his wife Meghan and promised to privately address revelations about a racist remark about their son.
Meghan and Harry's tell-all TV interview with Oprah Winfrey aired on U.S. television on Sunday has plunged the monarchy into its biggest crisis since the 1997 death of Harry's mother Diana.
In the two-hour show, Meghan accused Britain's royal family of raising concerns about how dark their son Archie's skin might be and ignoring her pleas for help while she felt suicidal.
Harry also said his father, heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, had let him down and that he had felt trapped in his royal life.
""The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement issued on behalf of Elizabeth.
""The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. Whilst some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.""
The Palace considered that this was a family matter, a royal source said, adding the royals should be given the opportunity to discuss the issues raised privately as a family. 
The interview was watched by 12.4 million viewers in Britain and 17.1 million in the United States, triggering a crisis to which the monarchy had to respond, media said. 
It has proved divisive among the British public, with some believing it showed how outdated and intolerant the institution was, while others decried it as a self-serving assault that neither Elizabeth nor her family deserved. 
""It could hardly be more damaging to the royal family, not least because there is little it can do to defend itself,"" The Times said in a lead article under the title ""Royal Attack"".
""The key to the monarchy's survival over the centuries has been its ability to adapt to the needs of the times. It needs to adapt again,"" The Times said.
Earlier on Tuesday, Charles made no comment when asked by a reporter what he thought of the interview while visiting a COVID-19 vaccine pop-up clinic in London.
A royal source had said Elizabeth, 94, who has been on the throne for 69 years, wanted to take some time before the Palace issued a response, saying it needed careful consideration.
A former senior royal aide said it was likely that the three most senior royals - the queen, Charles and Prince William, second in line to the throne and Harry's elder brother, would have held meetings with their private secretaries and communications chiefs to decide on their response.
""This is pretty important and they've got to judge it right,"" said the former aide, adding the queen would have had the final say.
TABLOID TORTURE? 
In the interview, nearly three years since her wedding in Windsor Castle, Meghan gained sympathy in the United States by casting some unidentified members of the royal family as uncaring, mendacious or guilty of racist remarks.
Meghan and Harry have also had a torrid relationship with the British press, successfully taking papers to court on occasions, and have repeatedly questioned what they say is reporting tainted by racist overtones. 
Harry said in the interview he did not know where to turn when faced with such troubling media coverage and felt hurt when his family failed to call out racist reporting.
He said the royal family had an unhealthy silent agreement with the British tabloids and that the family was paranoid about the media turning on them.
""There is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations,"" Harry said. 
For the monarchy, which traces its history through 1,000 years of British and English history to William the Conqueror, Meghan's bombshell has been compared to the crises over the death of Diana and the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson watched the interview, his spokesman said, but would not be making further comment on it.
Johnson said on Monday he had the highest admiration for the queen but that he did not want to speak about the interview. New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her nation was unlikely to stop having the queen as head of state soon.
'TRAPPED'
Opponents of the monarchy said the allegations made by Meghan and Harry showed how rotten the institution was and that the Palace's public relations machine had created a distorted image of the royals. 
""Now people are getting a much clearer picture of what the monarchy is really like. And it doesn't look good,"" said Graham (NYSE:GHM) Smith, head of Republic, a campaign group which seeks to abolish the monarchy.
Royal supporters cast Meghan, 39, an American former actor, as a publicity seeker with an eye on Hollywood stardom.
A YouGov poll found a majority of young people thought the royals' treatment of the couple was unfair, while half of older people said the opposite.
The gravity of the claims has raised questions about how the British monarchy, which survived centuries of revolution that toppled their cousins across Europe, could function in a meritocratic world.
Meghan, whose mother is Black and father is white, said her son Archie, who turns two in May, had been denied the title of prince because there were concerns within the royal family ""about how dark his skin might be when he's born"".
She declined to say who had voiced such concerns, as did Harry. Winfrey later told CBS that Harry had said it was not the queen or her 99-year-old husband Philip, who has been in hospital for three weeks while the crisis unfolds.

Meghan's estranged father Thomas Markle, who she has not spoken to since her wedding, said he did not think the British royal family was racist.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors alleged on Tuesday that Honduras had become a ""narco-state"" with security forces and politicians, including President Juan Orlando Hernandez, working with traffickers to move large quantities of cocaine into the United States.
In opening statements to the jury in the trial of alleged drug trafficker Geovanny Fuentes Ramirez, the prosecution said the defendant had paid Hernandez in order to receive protection from security forces in Honduras. 
Fuentes Ramirez pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of drug trafficking and related weapons offenses. 
""He was untouchable, a key part of the Honduran narco-state,"" prosecutor Jacob Gutwillig said of Fuentes Ramirez in his opening statements to the jury. 
""This is a violent, armed cocaine trafficker, who worked with police, military, politicians, including the president, who made millions helping the president traffic cocaine.""
Hernandez, who has repeatedly denied any involvement in drug trafficking, was a key ally to the United States under both the Obama and the Trump administrations, in both immigration and anti-narcotics operations in the region. 
The investigation could complicate the new Biden administration's efforts to invest $4 billion in Central America, including Honduras, to address the causes of migration.
In a series of tweets on Monday, Hernandez said that drug traffickers were giving false testimony against him to U.S. authorities as revenge against his government and to reduce their own sentences. He said Honduras' anti-narcotics cooperation would be harmed if U.S. authorities believed them. 
According to the indictment, Hernandez, who has been president since 2014, used Honduran law enforcement and military officials to protect drug traffickers, including Fuentes Ramirez, who they said bribed Hernandez with $25,000.
Prosecutors said Fuentes Ramirez began trafficking small amounts of drugs in 2009, but that it was not until 2013, when he partnered with Hernandez, then a presidential candidate, that his business started to ""flourish.""
The Drug Enforcement Administration agent who arrested Fuentes Ramirez in Miami in March 2020, Brian Fairbanks, testified for the prosecution on Tuesday that along with photos of assault rifles and cash, the agency found contact information for Hernandez in the businessman's cell phones.
Evidence submitted from Fuentes Ramirez's cell phones and his son's iCloud account showed a photo of Cristian Fuentes, the businessman's brother and a current congressional candidate, with Hernandez, as well as contact information for ex-President Mel Zelaya and a number of high-ranking military and police officials.
In court on Tuesday, the defense acknowledged that Fuentes Ramirez knew Hernandez through Fuad Jarufe, the owner of the rice business where the defendant allegedly paid bribes to Hernandez. However, defense lawyer Eylan Schulman said in his opening statement to the jury that the government's case was ""dependent on self-interested witnesses with too much to gain, too little to lose,"" in reference to the self-confessed traffickers expected to testify against Fuentes Ramirez. 

Prosecutors alleged that Fuentes Ramirez reported ""directly to Tony Hernandez,"" the president's brother, who was convicted in federal court in Manhattan of drug trafficking and related weapons charges in October 2019. In that trial, U.S. prosecutors said President Hernandez had accepted millions in bribes from drug traffickers. He has repeatedly denied the allegation.

CHAMPHAI, India (Reuters) - When Tha Peng was ordered to shoot at protesters with his submachine gun to disperse them in the Myanmar town of Khampat on Feb. 27, the police lance corporal said he refused.
""The next day, an officer called to ask me if I will shoot,"" he said. The 27-year-old refused again, and then resigned from the force.
On March 1, he said he left his home and family behind in Khampat and travelled for three days, mostly at night to avoid detection, before crossing into India's northeastern Mizoram state.
""I had no choice,"" Tha Peng told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday, speaking via a translator. He gave only part of his name to protect his identity. Reuters saw his police and national ID cards which confirmed the name.
Tha Peng said he and six colleagues all disobeyed the Feb. 27 order from a superior officer, whom he did not name.
Reuters could not independently verify his or other accounts gathered near the Myanmar-India border.
The description of events was similar to that given to police in Mizoram on March 1 by another Myanmar police lance corporal and three constables who crossed into India, according to a classified internal police document seen by Reuters.
The document was written by Mizoram police officials and gives biographical details of the four individuals and their account of why they fled. It was not addressed to specific people.
""As the Civil disobedience movement is gaining momentum and protest(s) held by anti-coup protesters at different places we are instructed to shoot at the protesters,"" they said in a joint statement to Mizoram police.
""In such a scenario, we don't have the guts to shoot at our own people who are peaceful demonstrators,"" they said.
Myanmar's military junta, which staged a coup on Feb. 1 and deposed the country's civilian government, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The junta has said it is acting with utmost restraint in handling what it has described as demonstrations by ""riotous protesters"" whom it accuses of attacking police and harming national security and stability.
Tha Peng's is among the first cases reported by the media of police fleeing Myanmar after disobeying orders from the military junta's security forces.
Daily protests against the coup are being staged across the country and security forces have cracked down. More than 60 protesters have been killed and more than 1,800 detained, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group, has said.
Reuters has not been able to confirm the figures independently.
Among the detainees is Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who led the civilian government.
DOZENS FLEE
Around 100 people from Myanmar, mostly policemen and their families, have crossed over a porous border into India since the protests began, according to a senior Indian official.
Several have taken shelter in Mizoram's Champhai district bordering Myanmar, where Reuters interviewed three Myanmar nationals who said they had served with the police.
As well as his ID cards, Tha Peng showed an undated photograph of him wearing a Myanmar police uniform. He said he joined the force nine years ago.
Tha Peng said that, according to police rules, protesters should either be stopped by rubber bullets or shot below the knees. Reuters could not verify police policies.
But he was given orders by his superiors to ""shoot till they are dead,"" he added.
Ngun Hlei, who said he was posted as a police constable in the city of Mandalay, said he had also received orders to shoot. He did not give a date, nor specify whether the order was to shoot to kill. He did not give details of any casualties.
The 23-year-old also gave only a part of his full name and carried his national ID card.
Tha Peng and Ngun Hlei said they believed police were acting under orders from Myanmar's military, known as the Tatmadaw. They did not provide evidence.
The other four Myanmar police agreed, according to the classified police document.
""...the military pressured the police force who are mostly constables to confront the people,"" they said.
Ngun Hlei said he was reprimanded for disobeying orders and transferred. He sought help from pro-democracy activists online and found his way by road to Mizoram's Vaphai village on March 6.
The journey to India cost him around 200,000 Myanmar kyat ($143), Ngun Hlei said.
Although guarded by Indian paramilitary forces, the India-Myanmar border has a ""free movement regime"", which allows people to venture a few miles into Indian territory without requiring travel permits.
'DON'T WANT TO GO BACK'
Twenty-four-year-old Dal said she had worked as a constable with Myanmar police in the mountainside town of Falam in northwestern Myanmar. Reuters saw a photograph of her police ID and verified the name.
Her job was mostly administrative, including making lists of people detained by the police. But as protests swelled in the wake of the coup, she said she was instructed to try to catch female protesters - an order she refused.
Fearing imprisonment for siding with the protesters and their civil disobedience movement, she said she decided to flee Myanmar. 
All three said that there was substantial support for the protesters within Myanmar's police force.
""Inside the police station, 90% support the protesters but there is no leader to unite them,"" said Tha Peng, who left behind his wife and two young daughters, one six months old.
Like some others who have crossed in recent days, the three are scattered around Champhai, supported by a network of local activists.
Saw Htun Win, deputy commissioner of Myanmar's Falam district last week wrote to Champhai's top government official, Deputy Commissioner Maria C.T. Zuali, asking for eight policemen who had entered India to be returned to them ""in order to uphold friendly relations between the two neighbour countries.""
Zuali confirmed she had received the letter, a copy of which has been seen by Reuters.
Zoramthanga, Mizoram's chief minister, told Reuters that his administration would provide temporary food and shelter to those fleeing Myanmar, but a decision on repatriations was pending with India's federal government.
Tha Peng said that although he missed his family he feared returning to Myanmar.
""I don't want to go back,"" he said, sitting in a first-floor room overlooking rolling green hills that stretch into Myanmar.

The bill, backed by the administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, would mark a major shift in a country bedeviled for years by violence between feuding drug cartels.
The health and justice committees approved the bill, which easily passed the Senate in a vote in November and would create a huge new legal market for marijuana that companies are eager to tap.
The full chamber of the Lower House was scheduled to discuss the bill on Tuesday, two congressional sources told Reuters.
The bill would create the Mexican Institute for the Regulation and Control of Cannabis, which will issue five types of licenses for the cultivation, transformation, sale, research and export or import of marijuana.
Only people 18 years and older, and with a permit, may grow, carry or consume marijuana and its derivatives, according to the bill, which Lopez Obrador's ruling MORENA party proposed. MORENA has a majority in both chambers of Congress.
Lopez Obrador has argued that decriminalizing cannabis and other narcotics could help combat Mexico's powerful drug cartels.
Colombian-Canadian  Khiron Life  Sciences (OTC:KHRNF), Canada's  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) and The Green Organic Dutchman, as well as Medical Marijuana, Inc. from California, are among the firms eyeing opportunities in Mexico.
Legalized cannabis could ""dramatically transform the economic landscape"" in Mexico by creating jobs and increasing tax revenues, said Medical Marijuana, Inc. chief executive Stuart Titus. 

""Much of Mexico's cannabis has been black market and the resulting war on drugs has proven to be a huge failure. The right solution: legalize, tax and regulate this market,"" he said.

914,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 08:37PM ET</span>","CBS News veteran Roger Mudd, who derailed a Kennedy with one question, dead at 93","By Dan Whitcomb and Steve Gorman
(Reuters) - Roger Mudd, the longtime CBS News political correspondent who famously helped sink Edward Kennedy's White House ambitions by asking in an interview why the senator wanted to be president, leaving the candidate flustered, died on Tuesday at age 93.
Mudd, who covered politics and national affairs at CBS for two decades before working at NBC News, PBS and the History Channel, died at his home in McLean, Virginia, of complications from kidney failure, according to a CBS News statement.
Mudd reported on some of the biggest stories in Washington, his hometown, during the 1960s and '70s, including passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the aftermath of Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1968 assassination, the Watergate scandal and the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974.
But he became best known for his 1979 interview with Kennedy in an hour-long profile of the prominent liberal senator from Massachusetts as Kennedy prepared to announce his bid to challenge Democratic President Jimmy Carter for their party's 1980 presidential nomination. 
Kennedy, then heir to one of the most prominent U.S. political dynasties, appeared awkward and unsure through much of the interview but came off as flummoxed when Mudd posed a simple, straightforward question: ""Why do you want to be president?""
The senator's halting, rambling reply was later seen as pivotal to dooming his presidential prospects. Carter defeated Kennedy for the nomination before losing the general election to Republican Ronald Reagan. Kennedy, who died in 2009, never ran for the White House again.
Mudd, who also covered the 1968 presidential campaign of Kennedy's older brother Robert F. Kennedy, was one of the last to interview him at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles moments before the senator was fatally shot there on June 5 after winning the Democratic presidential primary.
President John F. Kennedy, elder brother to Robert and Edward, was himself assassinated in Dallas in 1963.
AMONG CRONKITE'S 'HORSEMEN'
Mudd, born in Washington, began his career in the 1950s as a newspaper and radio reporter in Richmond, Virginia, and later went to work at WTOP News, then the CBS affiliate in Washington.
Joining CBS News as a congressional correspondent in 1961, in an era when most American television viewers tuned into one of the three major networks' nightly newscasts, he went on to gain national recognition covering the two-month Senate filibuster that preceded passage of the Civil Rights Act.
Mudd also became well-known for in-depth CBS News special reports, including a documentary titled ""The Selling of the Pentagon,"" which exposed extravagant Pentagon spending to promote its pursuit of the Vietnam War.
The segment ignited a furor on Capitol Hill and earned Mudd a Peabody Award.
A frequent weekend anchor for the ""CBS Evening News"" and stand-in for regular weeknight anchor Walter Cronkite, Mudd became known as one of Cronkite's ""lead horsemen"" in an era when CBS led the Big 3 broadcast networks in the news ratings.
But Mudd left CBS for rival NBC News after the weeknight anchor chair was awarded to Dan Rather - a move CBS said it made to keep Rather from accepting a big ABC News contract - following Cronkite's retirement in 1981.
Mudd served briefly as co-anchor with Tom Brokaw of ""NBC Nightly News"" before Brokaw took over as sole anchor of the broadcast in 1983. Mudd then joined PBS' ""The MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour"" in 1987 as a political commentator and reporter.
In 1992, he began teaching at Princeton and Washington and Lee universities while going to work for the History Channel, retiring in 2004 after 10 years as its principal on-air host.

Mudd was distantly related to Dr. Samuel Mudd, a Maryland physician imprisoned as a conspirator in the 1865 assassination of Abraham Lincoln after treating John Wilkes Booth's broken leg hours after the actor fatally shot the president.

915,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 08:36PM ET</span>","Special Report: Ten years on, grief never subsides for some survivors of Japan's tsunami","By Mari Saito
RIKUZENTAKATA, Japan (Reuters) - Migaku-san, I've left your dirty gloves and your holey shoes by the door. I'm worried you'll kick up a fuss when you return and ask where I put your shoes, so I've left them by the door without polishing them.
- Letter from Sachiko Kumagai to her husband after he was lost in the tsunami.
When the tide finally receded, the world had changed. Trucks and houses had been swept aside like children's toys, leaving the living to comb through a wasteland of mud and debris for their dead. Ten years on, the living are still searching, their grief never subsiding.
A father lives alone in a house at the end of a long driveway lined with cherry trees. He surrounds himself with books on the disorder that isolated his younger son in his room, unable to flee even when his mother begged him to evacuate as the tsunami roared toward them.
A mother is haunted still by the cries of stranded children, maybe even her own, calling out for help in the darkness. Even now she carries around a laminated schedule of her daughter's kindergarten bus, as if to prove that her 6-year-old should still be alive.
A wife never gave up hope that her husband would return to her. In scribbled letters on the back of calendars, she chided her husband for staying away, sometimes writing his imagined response encouraging her to go on without him.
The 10th anniversary of the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami will be a nationally televised event, with dignitaries in black suits gathering at a theater in Tokyo, where they will bow their heads and mark the moment of the disaster. For many survivors, the day will be marked by quiet prayers and family visits to gravesites.
But for others, the day will feel little different than any other date on a calendar. They remain suspended, trapped in those frantic hours a decade ago.
The earthquake and tsunami killed nearly 20,000 people on a stretch of Japan's Pacific coast more than 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of Tokyo. The disasters also triggered multiple meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, which forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents.
The central government pledged to rebuild the region and has spent around 31 trillion yen ($286 billion) on reconstruction. In the span of a few years, Japan built new neighborhoods, parks and schools. But the scale of loss here is beyond any policy response. Thousands of residents have moved away from the hardest-hit cities, with many of those who remain haunted by all that was lost.
While some survivors look backward, the larger Japanese public is preparing to celebrate the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, an event the government is intent on using to showcase its recovery from the disaster.
In Rikuzentakata, a city that lost almost a tenth of its population in the tsunami, a 12.5-meter (41-foot) sea wall encircles the coastline, a project designed to protect residents from future floods. Instead, the city can feel like a fortress where the concrete wall obscures any view of the ocean. On a chilly night in March, a howling wind drowned out any sound of lapping waves. In the darkness, only a slither of the sea was visible above the slabs of concrete, its serene surface concealing the noiseless churn of water below.
Yoshihito Sasaki, 70, can see the ocean from his front room, but he has long ago given up fishing or taking walks by the sea. He moved into his current home after the tsunami swept away his old house here, where he lived with his wife and two sons.
In March 2011, Sasaki was a few weeks shy of retirement, working as a principal in an elementary school built on higher ground in Hirota, a fishing village half an hour's drive from his family's home.
After making sure that all of his students were safe, and learning that his older son, Yoichi, had survived, Sasaki began searching for the rest of his family. He had already assumed the worst about his other son, 28-year-old Jinya, who had been a ""hikikomori"" for a decade, a Japanese term for people who withdraw from society. When the disaster hit, Jinya hadn't left their house for two years.
""I thought maybe my wife had survived, so when I went to shelters, I asked them if they saw a woman who had lost her mind,"" Sasaki said quietly, averting his eyes. He knew that leaving her son behind in the tsunami would have destroyed Mikiko, his wife.
Sasaki was unable to find Mikiko in any of the evacuation centers. Her body was recovered weeks later.
Later, he learned that his wife had tried to coax their son out of the house as the water kept rising. Jinya refused to leave, saying until the end that he didn't want to see other people. Mikiko finally ran out of the house, taking shelter on a neighbor's roof with their elder son. From there, they watched the wave swallow their home.
Sasaki took off his glasses and busied himself with a pile of newspaper clippings on his table. A warm orange light filled the room, which was still cluttered with boxes his surviving son left behind when he moved out in December.
For almost a decade after the disaster, Sasaki and his son lived together but never discussed the day of the tsunami. The two men finally talked over sushi a few months ago, when his son was preparing to move away.
""I asked my son what my wife said to him at the end,"" Sasaki said. The last time his son saw her, she was holding onto a piece of wreckage in a black tide, yelling out to him. ""He told me that she was screaming for him to live,"" he said, sighing. ""She told him to survive.""
Yoichi held onto wreckage and drifted for hours in the tsunami's waters before he was finally rescued.
After the tsunami, Sasaki bought dozens of books about his late son's condition, out of regret that he had not done more to support his late wife. Turning on the fluorescent light in his room, Sasaki pulled out a folder full of newsletters that he has written in the past decade about the hikikomori. He also moderates a support group for parents every month where he listens to others vent and cry about their reclusive children.
Even so, Sasaki is plagued by regret. Several times, he repeats that his older son may still blame him for not doing more to help his wife with Jinya.
""I thought maybe time would solve things, but I know now that's not the case. There are things you want to forget but can't,"" he said, with a pause. ""Some memories, those key memories in your mind, are actually more vivid now.""
A MOTHER HAUNTED BY LOSS
In Ishinomaki, a coastal city in neighboring Miyagi prefecture, nearly 3,200 people died in the disaster. One of them was Airi, Mika Sato's daughter, who loved playing with her little sister and wanted to be a TV presenter when she grew up.
Airi was at a local kindergarten when the earthquake struck. Shortly after, teachers put Airi and four others on a bus, which took them down the hill and closer to the coast.
It took three days for Sato to find Airi. She walked through a field of rubble where thin plumes of smoke still smoldered between bits of plywood and metal. One of the other parents eventually found the charred remains of a yellow school bus hidden under what had been the metal roof of a house.
""By the time we found them, all that was left of her was as small as a baby's,"" said Sato, cradling her arms as if she were holding her daughter. ""We were so afraid the wind would blow them away.""
Sato said it wasn't until later that she heard from neighbors that they could hear children calling for help until midnight, hours after a 28-foot tsunami swept into Ishinomaki.
Sato and other parents kept asking the school for an explanation of what exactly happened on the day of the tsunami. Five months after the disaster, Sato and three other families filed a lawsuit against the operator of the kindergarten.
""We thought we would find the truth in court,"" said Sato, 46. ""It was completely different from what we expected; we didn't get anywhere near the truth."" Sato had hoped that the school would explain why it had decided to put the children on a bus toward the coast after a massive quake, but school staff repeated in court that they had not heard the tsunami siren, she said.
Sato and other plaintiffs reached a settlement with the school in 2014. As part of the settlement, the school took legal responsibility and promised to provide a ""heartfelt apology"" to the families, Sato and her lawyer, Kenji Kamada (NASDAQ:KMDA), said. Though the school has sent flowers, Sato said she has never received a formal apology.
A lawyer who represented the school, which is now closed, said it continued to send flowers to the families involved in the case every year. He declined to comment further on the matter, referring questions on the details of the settlement to the plaintiffs.
Sighing, Sato walked to a memorial built along a busy coastal road, close to where she had found her daughter. Taking off her mask, she touched Airi's name carved into stone.
""The anger doesn't go away,"" she said, adding that as a naturally shy person, she had never wanted to be a public figure embroiled in such a court case. ""Our precious daughter died and the fact that …,"" she started to say, before a local man approached her, saying he recognized her from TV interviews.
After reminiscing about the disaster, the man told her it was shameful that people went to court for money after the disaster.
""Didn't you get like 300 million yen?"" the man asked.
""Actually no, we didn't,"" Sato answered calmly, before the man cut her off.
""We all suffered and it's time to move on,"" he mumbled before walking away.
Afterward, Sato said most locals had been supportive, but others believe survivors like her shouldn't have pursued their cases in court. The family members of four of the children who died on the bus shared a settlement of 60 million yen ($550,000), Sato's lawyer said. Civil lawsuits like the one filed by Sato are much less common in Japan compared to in the United States.
""I've gotten kind of used to it by now,"" Sato said sadly, walking back to her parked car. She wondered aloud how the man would react if he had lost his own child or grandchild in such a devastating disaster.
""Some people say heartless things, but people who don't understand will never understand, no matter what you say.""
LETTERS TO A DEAD HUSBAND
Across Japan's northeast region, more than 2,500 people are still reported missing from the disaster. In Iwate Prefecture, police officers hold monthly walk-in sessions at local shopping malls and community centers for families who haven't stopped searching for their loved ones. At these meetings, police officers take down identifying details about the missing and sometimes collect DNA samples from family members.
The lack of remains and the difficulty of the search have prolonged the sense of limbo for some families.
Three months after the tsunami, Sachiko Kumagai began writing letters to Migaku, her husband, a beloved local fisheries worker who went missing after he left his hillside home on the day of the disaster. He was 71, and she was 69. Her letters, hundreds of them, usually written with a magic marker, start with the weather and a description of the breakfast she had set out for him, and are interspersed with her gnawing questions about where he might be.
In several, Kumagai responds as her husband.
""Mama-chan, I won't be able to return even if you keep brooding over it … I'll be waiting for you, you can do it, you can.""
Hitoshi Tsurizaki, 71, first met Kumagai when he was volunteering after the disaster in Rikuzentakata. In an effort to help her process her grief, Tsurizaki offered to type up Kumagai's letters and bound them in books for her.
""I think there are a lot of people who wish things could go back to how they were, which we know is not possible,"" he said. A lack of conclusive proof that their family members had died pushed some to fall into a state of magical thinking, he said, allowing them to grasp at all sorts of explanations for their loved ones' sudden banishment.
""If typing up those letters helped her in any way process his passing, then I'm grateful,"" he said.
Makoto Kumagai, the couple's 51-year-old son, said he didn't understand his parents' bond until he read some of his mother's letters.
In 2017, six years after the tsunami, Kumagai finally filed her husband's death certificate. Kumagai died a year later. In one of her final letters, she seemed resigned to her loss.

""Good morning Migaku-san. Not many days left in the year. Seems like we'll finish out another year without finding you … Wouldn't it be a miracle if you wander back to the Ono Bay? I've heard miracles exist, but it doesn't seem to in this disaster.""

916,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 08:25PM ET</span>","From safety of Taiwan, new magazine reaches out to Hong Kong diaspora","By Ann Wang
TAIPEI (Reuters) - A new magazine in support of Hong Kong's struggle for democracy is reaching out to the diaspora and those still living in the former British colony, offering unvarnished commentary from the safety of Taiwan where it is published.
Democratic Taiwan has emerged as a place of refuge for some Hong Kongers, to Beijing's anger, especially after China's enforcement of a tough new national security law in Hong Kong last year.
In Chinese the new quarterly magazine is called ""be water"", after a tactic protesters used to evade Hong Kong police and inspired by a maxim of home-grown martial arts legend Bruce Lee that encourages them to be flexible or formless. 
The first issue came out in January.
Called Flow HK in English, the magazine's editor-in-chief is exiled activist Sunny Cheung, and its editorial board includes other well-known campaigners.
Chiang Min-yen, a Taiwanese activist who works from the magazine's small Taipei office and also sits on the editorial board, told Reuters the publication wanted to provide a forum for discussion and how to continue the fight for freedom and democracy.
""People are thinking about what's next for Hong Kong and what can Hong Kongers do - how can people support Hong Kong and oppose the authoritarianism of the Communist Party,"" he added.
The magazine encourages Hong Kong subscribers to get the electronic version due to security concerns about police potentially finding a physical copy in people's homes.
Hong Kong authorities maintain that freedom of speech and that of the media are intact, but say national security is a red line.
The national security law punishes anything China considers subversion, secessionism, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
In his piece for the inaugural edition, Cheung urges people not to give up, saying the resistance movement is like a buried stream of fire ready to become a river.

""Overseas Hong Kongers must fight, and will not give up on their dream to go home. If you are not free in Hong Kong, then what is the use of freedom?""

LONDON (Reuters) - An international coalition set up to prepare for future infectious disease threats set out what it called its ""moonshot"" plan on Wednesday to ensure new vaccines against emerging disease epidemics are developed within 100 days.
Launching a $3.5 billion five-year strategy to tackle future pandemic risks, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said more needs to be done urgently to mitigate the threat posed by new COVID-19 variants, and to prepare for new infectious diseases. 
Compressing vaccine development timelines to 100 days would make them around a third as long as it took the world to develop the first COVID-19 vaccines, CEPI said in a statement. 
It called on governments, global health organisations and other partners to back what it said was a ""critical investment in global health security"" and to take advantage of ""the revolution in vaccinology that has been catalysed by COVID-19"".
""We now have the tools to dramatically reduce or eliminate the risk of future epidemics and pandemics,"" CEPI's chief executive Richard Hatchett said. ""We must invest now in the vaccines and biologic countermeasures that we need, while linking these investments with commitments to equitable access.""
CEPI, which was created in 2017 with initial donor funding from Germany, Japan and Norway and from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust global health charity, has played a key role in funding early development of a range of candidate vaccines against COVID-19.
Its plan for 2022-2026 is now focused on honing and adjusting vaccines for use against the SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, as well as preparing for as yet unknown emerging disease threats.
To be able to squeeze vaccine development timelines down to 100 days, CEPI said, researchers and drug developers would need to exploit the capabilities of so-called rapid response platform technologies, such as the mRNA approach used in COVID-19 shots developed by Pfizer-BioNtech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) for example.

It would also involve working with global drugs regulators to streamline the requirements needed for vaccines to be approved, and linking-up manufacturing facilities to enable rapid production of pandemic vaccines, CEPI said.

(Reuters) - Arkansas will ban all abortions except in medical emergencies as of August under legislation signed by Governor Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday, a measure that will be the nation's strictest abortion regulation if it is not overturned in court.
The abortion restriction, like many others passed in Republican states in recent years, is part of a conservative effort to prompt the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark case that guarantees a woman’s right to abortion.
The Arkansas abortion ban makes no exceptions in cases of rape or incest, and goes further than abortion restrictions passed in South Carolina and other states, which banned the procedure starting at six weeks into a pregnancy.
Alabama is the only state to have recently passed a similarly sweeping anti-abortion policy, when the state made it a felony for doctors to perform abortions except to save a mother's life in 2019. That law was struck down in federal court.
""Governor Hutchinson: we’ll see you in court,"" the Arkansas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.
Hutchinson, a Republican, said in a statement he would have preferred exceptions for rape and incest, which he thought would have improved the law's chances of a favorable review by the U.S. Supreme Court. He said he signed it due to its ""overwhelming legislative support.""
The law contradicts ""binding precedents of the U.S. Supreme Court, but it is the intent of the legislation to set the stage for the Supreme Court overturning current case law,"" the governor's statement said. 
The law is due to go into effect in August, 90 days after the Republican-led legislature is scheduled to adjourn. 

Abortion is one of the most divisive issues in the United States, with opponents citing religious beliefs to declare it immoral, while abortion-rights activists say the procedure is basic healthcare and restrictions rob women of control over their bodies.
Women's healthcare and abortion provider Planned Parenthood denounced Arkansas' law and said politicians should be more focused on the state's COVID-19 response and vaccination efforts right now.
""Our patients deserve better. Planned Parenthood will work alongside its partners to fight this attack on our rights and freedoms,"" Planned Parenthood Action Fund president Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration's review of its policy towards North Korea is expected to be completed ""within the next month or so,"" a senior official of the administration told Reuters on Tuesday while declining to say what direction it might take.
The new administration, which took office in January, announced the review following former President Donald Trump's unprecedented engagement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which failed to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.
""We are involved and engaged in a highly intense strategic review. Our expectations are that it will be done in within the next month or so,"" the official said.
Biden's Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the approach to North Korea could involve more sanctions or unspecified diplomatic incentives. 
The senior administration official said the U.S. officials involved in the review had been engaged with diplomacy in one manner or other since the mid 1990s. 
""Our expectations are probably very much shaped by previous experiences,"" he said, while noting ""some interesting dynamics about the previous, the most immediate, period.""
""I think we want to explore a variety of different things,"" he said without elaborating on the content.
The official said North Korea would be among the topics discussed at a first summit of the Quad group of nations - the United States, Japan, India and Australia on Friday. It will also be a topic when Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin visit Japan and South Korea later this month. 
The Pentagon expressed concern last week about a U.N. report indicating possible preprocessing of nuclear fuel for bombs by North Korea, and said such activity could raise tensions with Pyongyang.

A confidential U.N. report seen by Reuters last month said North Korea developed its nuclear and ballistic missile programs throughout 2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A first ever leaders' meeting of the Quad group of countries on Friday plans to announce financing agreements to support an increase in manufacturing capacity for coronavirus vaccines in India, a senior U.S administration official told Reuters.
The financing agreements will be between the United States, Japan and others and focus particularly on companies and institutions in India manufacturing vaccines for American drugmakers  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), the official, who did not want to be identified by name, said.
The aim of the initiative by the Quad, which groups the United States, India, Japan and Australia, would be to reduce manufacturing backlogs, speed vaccination, and defeat some coronavirus mutations, the official said.
""The idea is that the quicker you can vaccinate, the more that you can defeat some of these mutations. So this is a capacity that will come online later this year, and it will substantially increase our capacity, collectively,"" he said.
Some of the additional vaccine capacity created in India would be used in vaccination efforts in Southeast Asian countries, the official added.
The White House announced earlier on Tuesday that President Joe Biden will participate in an online Quad meeting on Friday, the first leader-level meeting of a group seen as part of efforts to balance China's growing military and economic power.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said she expected a range of issues facing the global community to be discussed ""from the threat of COVID, to economic cooperation and ... the climate crisis.""

India has urged the other Quad members to invest in its vaccine production capacity in an attempt to counter China's widening vaccine diplomacy.

921,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 06:25PM ET</span>",Analysis: Japan's 'solidarity' quake tax may be model to foot pandemic bill,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Takaya Yamaguchi
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is paying for the huge cost of rebuilding areas hit by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami with a special ""solidarity"" tax that could become a model to shoulder the much bigger spending needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
Households are bearing the brunt of the bill, paying an extra 2.1% in income tax for 25 years through 2037. For those with annual taxable income of 10 million yen ($92,000), that equates to an extra 37,000 yen a year.
While companies were supposed to pay an extra 10% tax for three years, they were off the hook after two years, which critics say was due in part to pressure from the powerful Keidanren business lobby amid global competition to lower corporate tax rates.
For politicians, it's a model that works.
Unlike Japan's unpopular sales tax that was doubled in two stages to 10% from 2014 to 2019, households won't feel pain each time they shop. Branding it as a ""solidarity"" special tax helps convince voters the levy is for a collective good.
Ruling party lawmakers say tax hikes would be a last resort in footing the cost of combating COVID-19 that has so far topped 70 trillion yen - more than double the spending for post-quake and tsunami reconstruction.
But Finance Minister Taro Aso flagged the chance of another special tax once the economy emerges from the pandemic's hit.
""Whenever a crisis hit, we took bold fiscal steps and the current generation strived to share the burden,"" Aso told the lower house financial committee last month, suggesting debate over a tax hike cannot be avoided in the long run.
Japan spent 31.3 trillion yen on reconstruction from the earthquake and tsunami - roughly the size of Egypt's economy - with another 1.6 trillion yen earmarked for the coming five years. 
Revenues from the special tax paid for about 40% of the cost, around four-fifths of which was collected from households. 
The additional tax of 2.1% was imposed on the amount of tax paid by individuals with the tax rates running as high as 45%, compared to the effective company tax rate of around 30%. 
Some lawmakers, such as members of the Japanese Communist Party, criticise the special tax as imposing too much of a burden on households. But their voices are few.
The biggest opposition party has kept mum as the tax was rolled out under a government led by some of its current members. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, known as pro-business, sees no merit in rocking the boat.
With Japan saddled with public debt 2.5 times the size of its economy, talk of a ""post-pandemic solidarity tax"" cannot be avoided, said Masahiro Kawai, a former finance ministry official and University of Tokyo professor who is now heading the Economic Research Institute for Northeast Asia.
""Such a tax would gain people's understanding if they perceive it as necessary to protect their livelihood and human capital,"" he said.
Others are sceptical. The pandemic has upended lives for almost the entire population, unlike March 2011, where people living in areas unaffected could rally to save those who faced devastation.
""It might be difficult to ask households to evenly share the burden this time, given a widening disparity between haves and have-nots since the coronavirus outbreak,"" said Hosei University Professor Kazumasa Oguro.

President Joe Biden's administration has said the United States intends to compete with China's growing influence and military strength in the Asia-Pacific. The Pentagon is carrying out a review of its strategy in the region.
""A wider base of long-range precision fires, which are enabled by all our terrestrial forces - not just sea and air but by land forces as well - is critically important to stabilize what is becoming a more unstable environment in the western Pacific,"" Admiral Phil Davidson, commander for U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.
Davidson cited enthusiasm by the Army and Marine Corps ""to embrace some of the capabilities that the Navy and Air Force have already developed.""
A budget document provided to Congress last month by the Indo-Pacific Command said the United States needed increased ground-based weapons along the first island chain, which would cost $408 million in fiscal year 2022 alone and $2.9 billion from fiscal years 2023 to 2027. 
The first island chain is the string of islands that run from the Japanese archipelago, through Taiwan, the Philippines and on to Borneo, enclosing China’s coastal seas.
While the United States has been able to use long-range weapons on ships and aircraft, there were limits placed on it because of an arms control treaty.
But the United States pulled out of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Russia in 2019. 
While the Pentagon has said it was in favor of placing such missiles in the region, allies in Asia have so far appeared to be opposed to the idea of hosting them.
Davidson said, however, that missile defense was not enough to deter a potential adversary.

""Missile defense is the hardest thing to do. And if I'm the manager of a baseball team, if I can have the best defenses in the world but if I can't score some runs, I can't win the game,"" Davidson said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Council President Charles Michel on Tuesday rejected charges of ""vaccine nationalism"" levelled against the EU, saying that while Britain and the United States have outright bans on exports of COVID-19 shots, the EU had not stopped exporting.
The EU has found itself under fire at home for a vaccine roll-out much slower than those of former member Britain or the United States, and abroad for so far doing less than China, Russia or India to supply vaccines to poor countries.
Last week it annoyed vaccine buyers abroad by endorsing an Italian decision to halt a shipment to Australia.
Britain had a quick retort for the comments by Michel, who represents the 27 European Union member states, saying it has not blocked the export of a single COVID-19 vaccine.
""Any references to a UK export ban or any restrictions on vaccines are completely false,"" a UK government spokesman said. 
Britain's foreign minister Dominic Raab has written to Michel to ""set the record straight"" and a representative of the EU's delegation to the UK has been summoned to a meeting at the Foreign Office, officials confirmed. 
In a lengthy statement Michel laid out a defence of the bloc's strategy. He said that without Europe, it would not have been possible to develop and produce several vaccines in less than a year, and EU solidarity had ensured that poorer countries of the bloc received their first doses.
He took aim at the ""highly publicised"" supply of vaccines by China and Russia to other countries.
""We should not let ourselves be misled by China and Russia, both regimes with less desirable values than ours, as they organise highly limited but widely publicised operations to supply vaccines to others."" Michel also noted that China and Russia had both vaccinated fewer people at home than the EU.
""Europe will not use vaccines for propaganda purposes. We promote our values,"" he said.
Michel also defended a system to control the export of doses produced in EU countries, invoked by Italy last week to block a shipment of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) shots to Australia.
""Our objective: to prevent companies from which we have ordered and pre-financed doses from exporting them to other advanced countries when they have not delivered to us what was promised,"" Michel said. ""The EU has never stopped exporting.""
He said the EU would become the world's leading vaccine producer in the coming months and was the best equipped to adapt vaccine output quickly to virus mutations.
The British government's rebuff of Michel's comments came at a time of growing tensions between London and Brussels following the completion of Britain's exit from the EU at the end of 2020.
Relations strained by years of bruising talks over Brexit took a turn for the worse in January when the EU briefly threatened to use emergency measures to stop coronavirus vaccines going from the bloc into Northern Ireland, a British-ruled province bordering EU member state Ireland.

""This pandemic is a global challenge and international collaboration on vaccine development continues to be an integral part of our response,"" the British government spokesman said.

Biden's two dogs ""are still getting acclimated and accustomed to their new surroundings and new people,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. 
On Monday Major, a 3-year-old German Shepherd, ""was surprised by an unfamiliar person and reacted in a way that resulted in a minor injury to the individual,"" she said. 
Psaki didn't identify who was bitten, and said the incident was handled by the White House medical unit with ""no further treatment needed."" 
CNN reported Monday evening that Major had bitten a security staff member. A White House official separately told NBC News the pets were with family friends in Delaware while first lady Jill Biden travels this week. 
The first lady, who is visiting military bases in Washington state and California through Wednesday, has said she has been trying to settle the two German Shepherds into their new 18-acre home in Washington, D.C., since Biden took office in January. 
The two dogs had already been scheduled to stay with a family friend in Delaware before the injury, Psaki said. 
Biden adopted Major in November 2018 from the Delaware Humane Society. Champ joined the family in 2008 when Biden was elected vice president under President Barack Obama. 
Jill Biden last month noted that the canines had to get used to the White House as well as its many staffers.
""I've been getting obsessed with getting our dogs settled because we have an old dog and we have a very young dog,"" she told ""The Kelly Clarkson Show"" in a Feb. 28 interview. ""So that's what I've been obsessed with, getting everybody settled and calm."" 
In 2008, as former President George W. Bush was winding down his second term, his Scottish Terrier Barney bit the finger of a Reuters reporter who was trying to pet him. 

The White House has no update on the Biden family's plans to get a cat, Psaki said.

(Reuters) - A group of New York City students filed a sweeping lawsuit on Tuesday that accuses the United States' largest public school system of perpetuating racism via a flawed admissions process for selective programs that favors white students.
The lawsuit in state court in Manhattan argues that a ""rigged system"" begins sorting children academically when they are as young as 4 years old, using criteria that disproportionately benefit more affluent, white students.
As a result, minority students are often denied an opportunity to gain access to more selective programs, from elementary to high school, and are instead relegated to failing schools that exacerbate existing inequities, the lawsuit contends.
The complaint asks a judge to order the school system to eliminate its current admissions screening process for intensely competitive selective programs, including gifted and talented programs and more academically rigorous middle and high schools.
""Racism thrives in New York City through its school system,"" Mark Rosenbaum of the pro bono law firm Public Counsel said at a news conference. He is one of several lawyers, including prominent civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, representing the students.
Rosenbaum described the case as ""the first lawsuit of its kind in the nation: to secure for the children of New York City the constitutional right to an anti-racist education as an integral part of a sound and basic education.""
The city's public school system is the country's largest, with approximately 1 million students, and has long been seen as deeply segregated along racial and socioeconomic lines. Close to three-quarters of Black and Latino students attend schools that have less than 10% white students, while more than a third of white students attend schools with majority white populations, according to data collected by the City Council.
Two years ago, Mayor Bill de Blasio attempted to eliminate the admissions exam for elite specialized high schools, but the state legislature, which has authority over the exam, rejected his proposal.
In a statement, Danielle Filson, a spokeswoman for the city's education department, noted the de Blasio administration has recently made some changes, including using teacher evaluations rather than a standardized test to identify gifted 4-year-olds and temporarily suspending middle-school admissions screens.
""This administration has taken bold, unprecedented steps to advance equity in our admissions policies,"" she said. ""Our persistent work to drive equity for New York City families is ongoing, and we will review the suit.""
The lawsuit, however, argued those moves do not go far enough to address the problem.
At a news conference, de Blasio would not specifically comment on pending litigation. But he agreed that specialized high school admissions are ""broken"" and said the city needs a new system for its gifted and talented program.
The plaintiffs include IntegrateNYC, a youth-led nonprofit devoted to integrating the school system.
In addition to admissions criteria, the lawsuit also faults the school system's curriculum, arguing that students of color learn that ""civilization is equated with whiteness"" and that history is taught from a Eurocentric point of view.

While the school system is majority Black and Latino, most teachers and administrators are white, the lawsuit notes.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Harry and Meghan's TV interview in which they talked of racism, neglect and feuding inside the royal family is the biggest challenge to the British monarchy this century, but supporters say it will survive, at least while Elizabeth is queen.
Meghan and Harry's accusations underscore just how hard the taxpayer-funded institution, which traces its roots through 1,000 years of British and English history, has found it to adapt to a meritocratic world and intense media scrutiny.
The monarchy, headed by Queen Elizabeth, will try to ride out the turmoil and then quietly reform - as it did in the abdication crisis in 1936 when Edward VIII gave up his throne for American divorcee Wallis Simpson, or in the public anger following the death of Harry's mother Princess Diana in 1997.
But there may be lasting damage, and with Britain nearing the end of its second Elizabethan age, a looming conflict of generations.
""This is a grim moment, there's no doubt, for the family,"" a former senior royal aide told Reuters. 
""It's very easy in these moments - and we are in a moment - to think dark thoughts about the future of the monarchy. I think it's pretty secure, but there's no denying that this is a meaningful blow and a difficult crisis for them to navigate.""
Plotting a path out of the crisis will fall to Elizabeth, 94, her son and heir Prince Charles, 72, and his eldest son Prince William, 38, plus a small group of advisers such as the queen's private secretary Edward Young, 54, and Charles' private secretary Clive Alderton, 53.
Ultimately the final decision will rest with Elizabeth - effectively chairman of ""the Firm"" - with input from Charles and William, though they will also have guidance from advisers and could consult Prime Minister Boris Johnson. 
Those top three royals gathered at Sandringham, the monarch's country retreat, in early 2020 to hash out a possible compromise for Harry and Meghan as they stepped back from official duties.

Around 40 hours after the interview aired, Elizabeth issued a statement to say the royals were saddened by the challenging experiences of Harry and Meghan and promised to privately address revelations about a racist remark about their son.
Throughout its history, the monarchy has had to cope with wars, revolution and civil strife. But in the last century, the greatest threat has come from within its own ranks.
The abdication crisis unexpectedly propelled George VI, a shy man who had a stammer, onto the throne in a turn of events which ultimately led to his daughter Elizabeth II, now 94, becoming queen, a role she has held for a record 69 years.
During that time, the greatest existential threat came in the tumult of the 1990s, when the institution struggled to cope with scandals and wrecked marriages, not least that of Charles to the late Diana.
After the death of Diana, then-Prime Minister Tony Blair convinced Charles to persuade the queen to come to London to be seen to address the nation, though there were tensions then between the PM's team and the Palace's advisers.
Blair felt the Palace had been slow to respond and parachuted his own PR chief in to help it deal with the crisis.
There are concerns the monarchy is again being pushed to the precipice - this time due to accusations of racism and neglect by Meghan and Harry, the sixth-in-line to the throne and younger brother of future king, William. 
""The royal family has faced far greater challenges in its existence and although front pages are fulminating with the hype that this is the greatest crisis that's hit the royal family, that's tosh,"" Mark Borkowski, one of Britain’s leading public relations experts, told Reuters.
ROYALS LIKE PANDAS?
Novelist Hilary Mantel, whose trilogy about the court of Tudor King Henry VIII garnered two Booker prizes, likened the royal family to pandas, ""expensive to conserve and ill-adapted to any modern environment"".
""But aren’t they interesting? Aren’t they nice to look at?"" Mantel wrote in a 2013 essay. ""Some people find them endearing; some pity them for their precarious situation; everybody stares at them, and however airy the enclosure they inhabit, it’s still a cage.""
Harry admitted he had felt confined.
""I was trapped but I didn't know I was trapped,"" he said. ""Trapped within the system, like the rest of my family are. My father and my brother, they're trapped. They don't get to leave and I have huge compassion for that.""
Polls show the British public overwhelmingly support the queen, and even republicans admit there is absolutely no prospect of any constitutional upheaval while Elizabeth is monarch. 
But approval for Charles - who Harry said he felt had let him down - is much lower.
The furore comes in the midst of a ""culture war"", often portrayed as a rift between an older generation wishing to protect Britain's history and heritage from a ""woke"" youth, who see their elders as blocking moves to end racial and social injustice. 
A snap survey carried out after the interview indicated that the British public's sympathies lay more with the queen and other royal family members than with Harry and Meghan, but were split on whether the couple had been treated unfairly, with younger people tending to take the couple's side while those over 65 did not.
Borkowski said the generation who grew up when Elizabeth came to the throne were dying out and the monarchy had to think about its future.

""This throws up many, many questions that need to be answered because of what Meghan and Harry have unveiled by opening up some wounds and pitching a battle in the heat of the culture wars,"" he said.

The TASS report comes after the United States shared with Afghan officials, Taliban leaders and others a draft peace plan calling for replacing the government with a power-sharing interim administration pending elections under a new constitution.
The U.S. proposal is intended to jump-start stalled talks in Doha between the Taliban and a team that includes Afghan officials on a political settlement to decades of conflict.
Moscow also has advocated a transitional power-sharing government as part of a peace deal. Russia's special representative on Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, told the Sputnik news agency last month that Moscow was ready to host intra-Afghan peace talks to break the stalemate in Doha.
TASS said the Russian Foreign Ministry planned to hold the conference on Afghanistan on March 18, but gave no further details.
A State Department spokesperson noted that, ""The United States has met in the past with Russia in support of the Afghanistan peace process. Recently we have discussed scheduling a meeting, but the United States has nothing to confirm at this time.""
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote last week in a letter to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani that the United States would ask Turkey to host ""a senior-level meeting of both sides in coming weeks to finalize a peace agreement."" 
The United States is facing a May 1 deadline for withdrawing the last 2,500 U.S. troops from Afghanistan under a deal signed with the Taliban by the former Trump administration.

SIRTE, Libya (Reuters) - Libya's designated interim prime minister, Abdulhamid Dbeibeh, urged the long-divided parliament on Tuesday to back his proposed unity government as it prepared for a confidence vote expected on Wednesday. 
The parliament, which split between western and eastern factions along with most state institutions as the country fractured soon after a 2014 election, is meeting for the first time in years for the session in the frontline city of Sirte. 
Though the U.N.-backed process appears to offer the clearest path in years to end Libya's decade of chaos and violence, it has also been dogged by allegations of corruption, influence peddling and the presence of foreign mercenaries. 
Meanwhile, Dbeibeh's 35-member cabinet list, distributed over the weekend after weeks of intense negotiating to keep all Libya's varied factions on board, was still being amended on Tuesday, he said.
Parliament spokesman Abdullah Belhaq said a final cabinet list would be presented to the parliament on Wednesday for a vote.
The session is taking place in Sirte's Ouagadougou Conference Centre, built by Muammar Gaddafi as a glossy gift to his hometown but damaged in fighting after his downfall and used by Islamic State when it ruled the city in 2015.
This year it has functioned as headquarters of a military formed by Libya's two main warring sides and the rival administrations they back to oversee their ceasefire. 
The Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), which is recognised by the United Nations, last year repulsed a 14-month assault on the capital by Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), leading to the truce. 
Addressing parliament, Dbeibeh decried the continued presence of mercenaries and other foreign forces in Libya and said his government's goals of unifying state institutions and holding an election planned for Dec. 24, if realised, would be big achievements. 
Both those ends were written into the mandate for his interim unity government by 75 delegates convened by the United Nations in meetings in Tunis and Geneva to plot a path to elections. 

However, the process, in which delegates voted on rival leadership candidates, led to allegations of vote buying. The issue was not raised in Tuesday's parliament session.

934,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 01:41PM ET</span>","Analysis: Lula’s revival suits Bolsonaro, but Brazil 2022 is a different match","By Anthony Boadle and Eduardo Simões
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva first ran for president in 1989.
Three decades later, the gravelly-voiced former union leader looks set for one more run at Brazil's top job after a Supreme Court judge quashed his convictions and restored his political rights.
His resurrection from the political ashes sets the stage for a déjà-vu election next year, pitting him against far-right President Jair Bolsonaro and giving voters a choice between the most polarizing figures on Brazil's political spectrum.
""This changes the whole picture,"" said Creomar de Souza, founder of Dharma Political Risk and Strategy in Brasilia. ""It's obviously still very early, but this strangles any momentum for a more moderate centrist candidate.""
That should suit Bolsonaro just fine. 
The former army captain won in 2018 with vows to expunge the leftist legacy of Lula's Workers Party, which led Latin America's largest economy from 2003 to 2016. 
Bolsonaro's rhetoric was simple, angry and very effective: The left was rushing Brazil on a one-way street to the same ruin as Venezuela, he warned. Politics in the capital Brasilia was rotten to the core. The country needed an unvarnished right-wing outsider like himself, with no links to major political parties. 
But as former U.S. President Donald Trump's failed re-election effort showed, it is harder to win on a drain-the-swamp platform when you've spent four years in charge of the swamp. 
Brazil is hurting, with a quarter million lost to COVID-19, an economy in worse shape than when Bolsonaro took over and anti-corruption operations dismantled. It is not clear if popular anger towards the Workers Party remains what it was in 2018. 
Even as he will leap at the chance to rail against the left's past mistakes, Bolsonaro cannot escape being judged on his own performance.
""Bolsonaro today doesn't have much to show for his presidency,"" said Leonardo Barreto, director at political consultancy Vector in Brasilia. ""The government has to show results to keep Bolsonaro in power. This is more important than the presence or absence of Lula in the presidential race.""
For Barreto and many other political analysts, that means Bolsonaro may pursue an increasingly populist agenda to shore up support. Promises of economic reforms, which won Bolsonaro supporters from the financial community, will be shelved. 
Financial markets reacted to the prospect of a further populist shift. Brazil's real, already the world's worst-performing currency against the dollar this year after the Libyan dinar and Sudanese pound, slumped to within 10 cents of its all-time low in May last year. [L8N2L74KZ]
There is also the question of which Lula decides to run. His remarkable longevity is a testament to a knack for reinvention. 
Will 2022 see a return of the leftist firebrand, who made his name stumping on factory floors in the 1980s, or the deal-making unifier that swapped blood-red T-shirts for tailored suits as he calmed markets after a landslide victory in 2002. 
It is too soon for firm conclusions, but voter surveys suggest Lula has a good shot, currently polling ahead of Bolsonaro. 
Speaking to Reuters in September, Lula joked that he had ""the energy of a 30-year-old and the political drive of a 20-year-old.""
It is, however, the shrewd experience of a 75-year-old lifetime politician that Bolsonaro should be most wary of. 

""It's a different game from 2018,"" said Carlos Melo, a politics professor at the Insper Institute in Sao Paulo. ""We'll have to see which way Lula goes.""

935,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 01:35PM ET</span>",Color-coded passage: Why smugglers are tagging U.S.-bound migrants with wristbands,"By Adrees Latif, Laura Gottesdiener and Mica Rosenberg
PENITAS, Texas (Reuters) - Along the banks of the Rio Grande in the scrubby grassland near Penitas, Texas, hundreds of colored plastic wristbands ripped off by migrants litter the ground, signs of what U.S. border officials say is a growing trend among powerful drug cartels and smugglers to track people paying to cross illegally into the United States.
    The plastic bands - red, blue, green, white - some labeled ""arrivals"" or ""entries"" in Spanish, are discarded after migrants cross the river on makeshift rafts, according to a Reuters witness. Their use has not been widely reported before.
Some migrants are trying to evade border agents, others are mostly Central American families or young children traveling without parents who turn themselves into officials, often to seek asylum.
    Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley sector, which spans more than 34,000 square miles (88,000 square kilometers)along the border in southeast Texas, have recently encountered immigrants wearing the bracelets during several apprehensions, said Matthew Dyman a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. 
    The ""information on the bracelets represents a multitude of data that is used by smuggling organizations, such as payment status or affiliation with smuggling groups,"" Dyman told Reuters.
The differing smuggling techniques come as Democratic President Joe Biden's administration has sought to reverse restrictive immigration polices set up by his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. But a recent jump in border crossings has Republicans warning the easing of hardline policies will lead to an immigration crisis.
U.S. border agents carried out nearly 100,000 apprehensions or rapid expulsions of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in February, according to two people familiar with preliminary figures, the highest monthly total since mid-2019.
PURPLE BRACELET 
    The categorization system illustrates the sophistication of organized criminal groups ferrying people across the U.S.-Mexico border, said Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center 
    ""They run it like a business,"" said Cardinal Brown, which means ""finding more patrons and looking for efficiencies."" Migrants can pay thousands of dollars for the journey to the United States and human smugglers have to pay off drug cartels to move people through parts of Mexico.
""This is a money-making operation and they have to pay close attention to who has paid,"" she said. ""This may be a new way to keep track."" 
Criminal groups operating in northern Mexico, however, have long used systems to log which migrants have already paid for the right to be in gang-controlled territory, as well as for the right to cross the border into the United States, migration experts said.
When increased numbers of Central American were arriving at the border on express buses in 2019, smugglers kept tabs on them by double checking ""the names and IDs of migrants before they got off the bus to make sure they had paid,"" Cardinal Brown said. 
A migrant in Reynosa - one of the most dangerous cities in Mexico across the border from McAllen, Texas - who declined to give his name for fear of retaliation, showed Reuters a picture of a purple wristband he was wearing.
He said he paid $500 to one of the criminal groups in the city after he arrived a few months ago from Honduras to secure the purple bracelet to protect against kidnapping or extortion. He said once migrants or their smugglers have paid for the right to cross the river, which is also controlled by criminal groups, they receive another bracelet. 
""This way we're not in danger, neither us nor the 'coyote,'"" he said, using the Spanish word for smuggler. 
    One human smuggler who spoke on conditions of anonymity, confirmed the bracelets were a system to designate who has paid for the right to transit through cartel territory.
""They are putting these (bracelets) on so there aren't killings by mistake,"" he said. 
Migrants and smugglers say the use of bracelets to designate who has paid for the right to cross the river is a system required by the cartels that control waterfront territory in the conflict-ridden state of Tamaulipas.

In January, a group of migrants were massacred in Tamaulipas state just 40 miles (70 km) west of Reynosa. Twelve local Mexican police have been arrested in connection with the massacre.

Tensions were already simmering between the government and feminist activists ahead of Monday's protests, fueled by anger at President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's support of a politician accused of rape. 
Lopez Obrador on Tuesday said the violence was politically motivated and led by ""conservative"" infiltrators, and praised the police officers for ""stoically"" resisting.
He showed footage of protesters smashing hammers against metal barriers that been erected to protect historic buildings and monuments. They also tore down a section of a 10-foot-tall barricade guarding the national palace.
""It was evident that they wanted to vandalize the national palace,"" Lopez Obrador said. ""If the wall had not been put up, many people would have been put at risk."" 
While the demonstrations were smaller than last year, thousands of mostly female protesters dressed in purple marched in Mexico City, spray-painting streets with messages accusing the government of not doing enough to prosecute femicides.
Marches last year also at times boiled over into violence, which some activists have described as a cry to emphasize the gravity of crimes against women. 
Of the almost entirely female police force at the marches, 62 officers were injured and nine of them hospitalized, with injuries ranging from bruises to a clavicle fracture, said Marcela Figueroa, a deputy secretary in Mexico City's public safety ministry.

Nineteen civilians were injured, and one of them also hospitalized, Figueroa said on Twitter. She added that both the officers and protesters were in stable condition.

For these besties, there was no better way to celebrate International Women's Day on Monday than to surf away their blues together at Solana Beach, California.
""It's exhilarating. There is nothing like being in the water, getting wet, getting cold and loving it,"" said 75-year-old Patti Fitchen.

For Stahl, riding the waves on her belly is bliss after 85 years of ups and downs.
""To find something to do that makes you forget all that and feel optimistic, I think that's the toughest part,"" she said.

Far-left militant Dimitris Koufodinas, 63, is being treated in intensive care at a hospital near the high-security prison of Domokos in central Greece. He began his hunger protest on Jan. 8 and suffered kidney failure last week. 
A leading member of the disbanded group November 17, he is serving multiple life terms for crimes including 13 murders - more than half the 23 killings the Marxist group says it carried out before its leaders were arrested in 2002. 
Koufodinas, who was once dubbed ""Poison Hand"" by some Greek media because of his deadly aim, says a government order for his transfer to Domokos in December was illegal. He wants to return to Korydallos prison in Athens, where other convicted members of November 17 are held. 
Greece's top administrative court ruled that it did not have the authority to issue a temporary ruling freezing the transfer ordered by the state. It will examine in April whether that decision was legal, the semi-official Athens News Agency said. 
Authorities had previously rejected his request, citing a recent prison system reform and a rise in COVID-19 cases in the region where Korydallos prison is. 
Sympathisers and civil rights activists, including members of the leftist opposition, have staged protests against what they see as the intransigent and arbitrary stance taken by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' conservative government.
Petrol bomb attacks against police and conservative politicians have also increased. 

Mitsotakis' brother-in-law was among those killed by Koufodinas. The government says it will not yield to blackmail and that convicts cannot decide where they will serve their sentence.

The vote risks further delaying the disbursement of new loans from the International Monetary Fund under a $5 billion deal package for Ukraine's virus-hit economy, where judicial reforms remain a sticking point.
The watchdog, the High Council of Justice, is an independent body that monitors the integrity of judges, nominates judicial appointments and can dismiss judges. 
Anti-corruption protesters rallied outside the hotel in Kyiv where the judges' congress was taking place, saying the selection process should have been more rigorous and done with the help of international experts. 
Supreme Court chief Valentyna Danishevska said postponing the vote would have been unconstitutional, saying at the start of the congress that the judges would choose people with an ""impeccable reputation"".
""We are urged not to hold a congress, but this is our constitutional duty,"" she said in televised comments.
Ukraine's international backers have long pressed Kyiv to clean up the judiciary, long seen as one of the biggest obstacles to tackling corruption.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Discontent is brewing in the ranks of Lebanon's security forces over a currency crash wiping out most of the value of their salaries as unrest and crime surge.
In unusually outspoken comments, army chief General Joseph Aoun said his warnings that the pressure on soldiers' earnings and morale could lead to an ""implosion"" had fallen on deaf ears.
Lebanon's pound has crashed 85 percent since late 2019 in a financial meltdown that poses the biggest threat to stability since the 1975-1990 civil war. 
""Soldiers are going hungry like the people,"" he said on Monday, berating politicians without naming names. 
""Do they want the army or not? Do you want the army to stay on its feet or not? ... They don't care."" 
The basic monthly salary of a soldier or policeman, which used to amount to around $800, is worth under $120 today. Budget cuts pushed the military to cut meat from its meals last year. 
In what was seen as a sign of the times, the French embassy donated food parcels last month to the Lebanese army, which has long been backed by Western nations. 
Some officials caution that security forces will struggle to contain unrest. 
More than half the population is now poor, with wages slashed across the board, prices soaring and no state rescue plan in sight. That was even before the currency hit a record low last week after months of political paralysis.
The military, its commander and the caretaker interior minister have denied recent local media reports that economic hardship spurred a rise in forces abandoning duty. 
Still, three security sources told Reuters a buildup of pressure on lower-ranking servicemen has fueled concerns of desertions. 
One member of the security forces, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he wanted to leave after many years because it had become hard to pay rent. He said he knew three others who had deserted, which is punishable by law, and worried commanders would reject his request for a discharge. 
""If nothing works, I'll have to resort to fleeing,"" he said. ""We're ready to protect of course but...I used to buy my kids whatever they wanted. Now I can barely afford groceries.""
A security source said army desertions were still within the usual pre-crisis figures, though there were plans to boost aid to avoid a rise. 
""We're feeling the choke but we're enduring."" He said a sense of national duty and bleak job prospects across Lebanon helped keep forces from wavering, but warned they should not ""be pushed too far.""
FEAR OF CRIME
With the country on edge, unrest is expected to grow. Lebanese have burned tyres and shut main roads for a week since the currency hit its new low.
A day after the president asked forces to open the roads, protesters still blocked highways leading out of Beirut on Tuesday. 
The economy's collapse has brought a shift in robberies with more people trying to steal food, baby formula or medicine, a second security source said. There was also an uptick in gunmen holding up drivers at night to take cars, he said. 
In 2020, murders jumped 91% from 2019, according to research firm Information International, based on police data. Robberies shot up 57% and car thefts hit a nine-year high.
A police spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. 
Road safety charity YASA said about 10,000 manhole covers had disappeared in Beirut, as thieves sell the cast iron for $100 each, more than Lebanon's monthly minimum wage. 
Fears of muggings have pushed many to take precautions like avoiding ATMs at night. Eight people, including a designer and an engineer, said this had pushed them to buy a pistol.

""If I had the money, I would have bought a licensed gun for the place,"" said shop owner Khodr Osman. ""There's no safety today. The state is in disarray.""

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador spearheaded efforts to attain more help from China, Ebrard said.
""As a result of a process personally led by the president of the republic, we have received the confirmation that we will have an expansion of up to 22 million doses,"" Ebrard said during Lopez Obrador's regular news conference.
Mexico's vaccine roll out has been criticized as overly slow, though officials say they've been hampered by delays in receiving vaccines amid global shortages.
The Biden administration appeared to have turned down Lopez Obrador's request, at least in the short term, for the United States to share its vaccines by saying the immediate priority is to inoculate American citizens. 
Mexico is now pinning its hopes on receiving some vaccines from the United States once Biden meets his goal of inoculating 100 million Americans in 100 days, a deadline due in late April. 
Ebrard said Mexico has placed an order for an additional 10 million doses of China's Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine to be delivered between May and July, on top of the 10 million already ordered, which are due to arrive between March and May.

Mexico will also order 12 million vaccine doses made by the state-backed China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) once it has been approved by its health regulator, Ebrard added.

He spoke after a meeting with top security officials on Monday but on Tuesday a major highway leading southward from Beirut as well as areas in the centre of the capital and around the northern city of Tripoli remained blocked with protesters burning tyres and urging more people to join them. 
Army chief General Joseph Aoun had said on Monday the right to peaceful protest would be protected barring damage to public or private property, but warned that troops should not get sucked into politics.
Lebanon's financial crisis, which erupted in 2019, has wiped out jobs, locked people out of their bank deposits and raised the risk of widespread hunger.
""What are the Lebanese people waiting for?....Are you able to teach your children? If a child gets sick, can you admit them to hospital? Can you buy them medicine...There is no education, no jobs, the dollar is at 10,000 (Lebanese pounds) and we are staying at home, dying slowly,"" protester Fadi Nader said. 
A new cabinet could implement reforms needed to trigger billions of dollars of international aid, but factional wrangling has frustrated the formation of a new government.
Groups of protesters have been burning tyres daily to block roads since the Lebanese currency tumbled to a new low last week, deepening popular anger over Lebanon's financial collapse. 
Three people died in car accidents amidst the roadblocks on Monday, local media reported. 
Local television aired a funeral in Zgharta in north Lebanon for two young men who died when they drove into a truck that was parked across a road to block traffic. 

""Every person in this country has to shoulder responsibility. Let protesters go to the houses of the leaders and their palaces, not block roads,"" the priest conducting the funeral told the gathering.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - A day after graft convictions of Brazil's leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva were overturned, he may see the evidence against him thrown out by the Supreme Court on Tuesday, clearing his name ahead of a possible 2022 presidential run.
The Supreme Court said Justice Gilmar Mendes had called a Tuesday vote on an appeal by Lula's legal team alleging that Sergio Moro, the former judge who sentenced him, was not impartial in overseeing investigations of the former president. 
If the top court rules in Lula's favor, it would cap a stunning reversal of fortunes for one of Brazil's most popular and divisive figures, whose political hopes appeared decimated by the corruption cases against him in recent years.
If he runs, the leftist firebrand would immediately be the leading rival next year against far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, whose popularity has suffered in the face of a raging pandemic, rising inflation and stretched public finances. 
A conviction blocked Lula's run for a third term in 2018 after he led Latin America's largest nation from 2003 to 2011. 
Financial markets lurched on the prospect of a more polarized 2022 race, with Brazil's currency slipping 0.5% after a sharp drop on Monday, heading toward its weakest close since May last year, when it hit all-time lows.
Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin on Monday annulled the criminal convictions against Lula by ruling that a court in the southern city of Curitiba, where Moro presided, had lacked the authority to try Lula on corruption charges. 
That decision, if upheld by the broader Supreme Court on appeal, would trigger Lula's retrial in federal courts in Brasilia, the capital, leaving open the chance of another conviction blocking a 2022 candidacy.
However, if the court sides with Lula on Tuesday in the vote called by Justice Mendes, it would effectively throw out the cases against Lula.

The precedent could also undo much of the so-called Car Wash corruption probe overseen by Moro, which led to the convictions of dozens of Brazil's political and business elite.

Caroline Wilson's article in Chinese was posted on the official WeChat account of the British embassy in Beijing last week, amid already tense relations between Britain and China over issues including Hong Kong, Xinjiang and the media.
Wilson sought to explain why foreign media criticism of the Chinese government did not mean the journalists responsible did not like China, but were in fact acting in ""good faith"" and playing an active role in monitoring government action.
In a statement, China's Foreign Ministry said the Chinese government and people had never opposed foreign media, rather those who make up ""fake news"" to attack China and its ruling Communist Party under the banners of press freedom and freedom of speech.
""The whole article is full of 'lecturer' arrogance and ideological prejudice ... and is seriously inconsistent with the status of diplomats,"" it added in remarks attributed to the head of the ministry's Europe department.
The UK Foreign Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Wilson, whose article was still accessible on WeChat on Tuesday but could not be shared on the platform, responded on Twitter, including a link to her article. 
""I stand by my article. No doubt the outgoing Chinese Ambassador to the UK stands by the 170+ pieces he was free to place in mainstream British media,"" she tweeted, referring to Liu Xiaoming, who was based in Britain for around 11 years before leaving the country in January.
Media has emerged as an area of tension in Sino-British ties. 
Beijing last month banned BBC World News from television networks in mainland China after finding it had ""seriously violated"" rules and undermined national unity.
That came a week after Britain's media regulator Ofcom barred Chinese state broadcaster CGTN from airing in the UK after it concluded that the Chinese Communist Party had ultimate editorial responsibility for the channel. 
The BBC has run a series of reports alleging human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims in China's Xinjiang region, which Beijing denies.
Tensions with London also flared over an offer of a path to British citizenship for residents of the former British colony of Hong Kong following the imposition of a national security law cracking down on dissent.

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - A Minnesota judge began screening jurors on Tuesday in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis policeman facing murder and manslaughter charges for his role in the death of George Floyd during an arrest that caused an outcry around the world.
Judge Peter Cahill of the Hennepin County district court did so over the objections of state prosecutors, who say the high-stakes trial should not begin until a higher court resolves how many criminal charges Chauvin should face. 
The prosecutors asked the Minnesota Court of Appeals on Monday, originally scheduled to be the first day of jury selection, to order Cahill to delay the trial, which has involved barricading parts of downtown Minneapolis for fear of civil unrest. 
""There is no need for this kind of uncertainty in any case, let alone a case of this magnitude,"" the prosecutors from the Minnesota attorney general's office wrote in their petition to the appeals court.
It was not clear whether the higher court would intervene, and Cahill said he believed he had jurisdiction to proceed unless he was ordered otherwise. 
He called in a small group of potential jurors, who have been promised anonymity for the duration of the trial, and began asking them if they knew any of the parties involved. Chauvin, dressed in a light gray suit, a blue shirt, a dark tie and a black face mask, briefly stood when his lawyer introduced him to the panel.
The trial is seen as a landmark case on police violence against Black people in the United States, a country where police officers are almost never found to be criminally responsible for killing civilians, including in cases where the suspected crime is minor or the suspect is unarmed. 
The trial on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter had been scheduled to begin on Monday. But the judge was stymied by an 11th-hour ruling by the Minnesota Court of Appeals on Friday that ordered him to reconsider the request by prosecutors to reinstate a third charge of third-degree murder. 
Lawyers for Chauvin, 44, asked the state Supreme Court on Monday to prevent the additional charge being applied.
He was released from jail on a $1 million bond last October and is being tried in a courtroom in the Hennepin County Government Center, a tower in downtown Minneapolis now ringed with barbed-wire fencing and concrete barricades for fear of disruption by protesters.
Chauvin, who is white, and three other police officers were fired the day after the deadly arrest on May 25 on suspicion that Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes at the Cup Foods grocery store.
Hundreds of anti-racism demonstrators chanted in the streets around the courthouse on Monday, blocking traffic. A small number of soldiers called in from the Minnesota National Guard watched from a distance.
The judge has set aside three weeks for jury selection alone, mindful of the difficulties finding impartial Minneapolitans in a case that has convulsed the nation. The image of the victim — a selfie of Floyd smiling faintly — has become an international icon of racial justice.
The court mailed prospective jurors an unusually detailed 16-page questionnaire last year asking them what they know about Floyd's death, and asking for their opinions on the Black Lives Matter movement.

Chauvin would face up to 40 years in prison if convicted on the most serious charge. His lawyers say he properly followed the training he was given by the Minneapolis police department.

White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Monday that President Joe Biden's administration was monitoring efforts tied to Russia's intelligence services aimed at undermining the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) coronavirus vaccines.
The United States said it had identified three online publications that Russia was using to spread disinformation about the two vaccines, as well as international organisations, military conflicts and protests. 
""We have always been against politicising issues related to vaccines. Russia has never participated and does not intend to participate in such campaigns against other vaccines,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 
""All these statements are absurd, have no basis in fact, and we really regret that anyone would take such statements seriously,"" he added. 
Russia's own flagship Sputnik vaccine has been authorised by 46 countries, according to the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which markets it abroad.
It could be produced in western Europe for the first time after a deal to make it in Italy was signed by the RDIF sovereign wealth fund and Swiss-based pharmaceutical company Adienne.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Nearly one in three women worldwide is subjected to physical or sexual violence during her lifetime, pervasive criminal behaviour that has increased during the pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.
The U.N. agency urged governments to prevent violence, improve services for victims and tackle economic inequalities that often leave women and girls trapped in abusive relationships.
Boys should be taught in school about the need for mutual respect in relationships and mutual consent in sex, WHO officials said.
“Violence against women is endemic in every country and culture, causing harm to millions of women and their families, and has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
Some 31% of women aged 15-49, or up to 852 million women, have experienced physical or sexual violence, the WHO said in what it called the largest-ever such study, encompassing national data and surveys from 2000-2018.
A husband or intimate partner is the most common perpetrator and a disproportionate number of victims are in the poorest countries, https://tmsnrt.rs/3t5OO78 it said. True figures are likely far higher due to under-reporting of sexual abuse, a heavily-stigmatised crime.
""These numbers are very shocking and really are sort of a wake-up call for governments to be doing much more to prevent this violence,"" report author Claudia Garcia-Moreno said.
In some regions, more than half of women face violence at some point, she told Reuters, citing Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia.
Countries with the highest prevalence include Kiribati, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Afghanistan, WHO data show.
The lowest rates are in Europe, up to 23%, over a lifetime.
Violence starts at an ""alarmingly young"" age, the WHO said. 
One in four adolescent girls aged 15-19 who have had a relationship have been subjected to either physical or sexual violence, Garcia-Moreno said.

""This is a very important and formative time in life. And we know that the impacts of this violence can be long-lasting and can affect physical and mental health and lead to unwanted pregnancies and other complications,"" she said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's foreign ministry said on Tuesday it had summoned the United Kingdom's high commissioner over what it called ""unwarranted and tendentious discussion"" of Indian agricultural reforms in the British parliament.
Three new agricultural laws introduced by India late last year have led to months of protests by farmers, angry at what they see as sops to large private buyers.
A discussion among UK lawmakers on Monday has caused anger in New Delhi, which accuses the parliamentarians of interfering in India's internal affairs. 
At Tuesday's meeting India's foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told Alexander Ellis, who was appointed as envoy earlier this year, the debate ""represented a gross interference in the politics of another democratic country,"" according to a ministry statement. 
""He advised that British MPs should refrain from practising vote bank politics by misrepresenting events, especially in relation to another fellow democracy,"" it added, in an apparent reference to British lawmakers and voters of Indian descent. 
A spokesman for the British High Commission, as the country's embassy in India is known, declined to comment. 
Unrest has been particularly intense in the state of Punjab, that has large diasporas in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada.
India summoned Canada's envoy in December following critical comments by Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. 

The protests received global prominence after celebrities including pop star Rihanna and climate activist Greta Thunberg voiced their support for the movement earlier this year.

Prayuth became frustrated when asked about a list of potential candidates for vacant cabinet posts, following last week's jailing of three of his ministers for insurrection during protests seven years ago.
""Is there anything else to ask?,"" he said, standing at a podium. ""I don't know, I haven't seen it. Isn't it something the prime minister should know first?""
In the live briefing, Prayuth then left the podium, grabbed a small bottle of sanitiser, casually walked over to the journalists and sprayed each of them while holding a surgical mask in front of his face.
Prayuth, a former military coup leader, is known for his casual, at times comical, remarks to media but he often lashes out at reporters. 

He was later filmed speaking with the same group of journalists and looking increasingly vexed, talking inaudibly while spraying them with broad sweeps of his hand before walking off again.

Since 2019, at least 100 municipalities across Poland have signed declarations saying they are free of ""LGBT ideology"". Although they appear not to have been followed by legislation to discriminate against gay residents, they have fuelled concern in Brussels and beyond of a drift in Poland towards illiberalism. 
""Polish authorities recently told me they were not able to schedule this visit, and that's profoundly regrettable,"" Beaune told L'Obs magazine in an interview.
A spokeswoman for Beaune told Reuters the French minister planned to visit the town of Krasnik in the east, one of the 100 municipalities which signed the declaration, but that Polish authorities had indicated ""it would be badly received to go to Krasnik considering the health situation.""
However, the Polish government denied the French minister, a close ally of President Emmanuel Macron, had been denied access.
""This is of course not true. No one in the Polish government forbade or made it impossible for the French deputy minister to visit Krasnik,"" Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sęk tweeted on Tuesday.
Critics, including the European Union, have accused the Law and Justice (PiS) government of backtracking on womens' and LGBT rights and running a campaign laced with homophobic rhetoric in the run-up to last year's presidential election.
Franco-Polish relations have been cold for years, with Macron saying shortly after his election in 2017 that Polish citizens ""deserve better"" than a government at odds with the bloc's democratic values.
Beaune, a rising star in the French government who publicly came out as gay in December, said he had decided not to cancel the two-day trip to Poland despite not being able to fulfil a promise he made to visit the ""LGBT-free zones"" after his nomination last year. He met LGBT campaigners on the trip.
""I could have gone to one of these zones without the Polish government's authorisation, but in my view, that's not how one should behave with an EU member state,"" he said.
Polish LGBT groups nevertheless took heart from Beaune's stance.

""It's definitely a very important signal to all of us, a political signal to our community, that we aren't alone. That foreign politicians are also looking at Poland and that they are our allies,"" Bartosz Staszewski, an LGBT activist who met Beaune on Monday, told Reuters.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany is the top target of Russian disinformation campaigns in the European Union, a report said on Tuesday, as ties between Moscow and the West hit new lows over the poisoning and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. 
The EU's disinformation watchdog, which is run by the bloc's External Action Service, said in the report it had documented 700 cases of deliberately fake or misleading reporting that aimed to spread disinformation about Germany since launching a tracking database in late 2015. 
That compares to more than 300 cases for France, over 170 for Italy and 40 for Spain, said the watchdog, which was set up after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and aims to combat what it sees as a deliberate smear campaign by Russia.
""Germany is singled out as the main target for Russian disinformation efforts among European member states,"" said the watchdog, which is called EUvsDisinfo. 
EUvsDisinfo said the Kremlin was trying to portray Germany as a country driven by ""irrational Russophobia"" to draw attention away from Russia's violations of human rights and international law.
""(Russia's approach) intends to create uncertainty, sow discord, give Russian officials for manoeuvre... The Kremlin doublespeak exploits Europe's, and Germany's commitment to dialogue,"" the report said.
SANCTIONS
Germany was among EU countries advocating for more sanctions on Russia over the case of Navalny, who received medical treatment in Berlin and recovered in the Black Forest after being poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent last year.
Navalny, an anti-corruption activist, says the Kremlin was behind the attack, which Moscow denies. He was arrested after returning to Moscow from Germany in January and is now serving a new jail sentence in a Russian penal colony.
The EU last month agreed to blacklist four senior Russian officials over the Navalny case, adding to economic sanctions it had earlier slapped on Russia over the annexation of Crimea and the Kremlin's support of armed separatists in eastern Ukraine.
EUvsDisinfo said Russia had depicted Germany as instrumental in driving the new sanctions that followed a trip by the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, to Moscow in February. 
While Borrell called for Navalny's release, he also played up the need for dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Russia in areas such as climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. During his visit, however, Moscow expelled four EU diplomats, including one from Germany.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who grew up in Communist East Germany, has long been critical of Moscow's human rights record, but Berlin has resisted U.S. pressure to block the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that would pump more Russian gas to Europe via Germany.

EU leaders will discuss next steps in their troubled relationship with Russia at a summit on March 25-26.

The coastline near the Tunisian port city of Sfax has become a major departure point for people fleeing conflict and poverty in Africa and the Middle East and seeking a better life in Europe.
In 2019, about 90 African migrants drowned when their boat capsized off the Tunisian coast after setting off for Europe from neighbouring Libya, in one of the worst such disasters that Tunisian authorities have had to deal with.
The number of Tunisian migrants landing on Italian shores soared fivefold to 13,000 in 2020, a human rights group said, attributing the rise to economic hardship in Tunisia.

Overnight, police arrested about 50 people who had been cornered by security forces in a district of Myanmar's main city Yangon, a rights group said. But hundreds managed to escape the encirclement after crowds of demonstrators rallied in their support in defiance of a night-time curfew. 
Western powers and the United Nations had called on the military to allow the youths to leave the area in safety. 
Myanmar has been in crisis since the army ousted Suu Kyi's elected government in a coup on Feb. 1, detained her and other NLD officials, and set up a ruling junta of generals.
Daily protests against the coup are being staged across the country and security forces have cracked down harshly. More than 60 protesters have been killed and more than 1,800 detained, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), an advocacy group, has said.
The NLD's Zaw Myat Linn died in custody on Tuesday after he was arrested in Yangon around 1:30 a.m., said Ba Myo Thein, a member of the dissolved upper house of parliament.
""He's been participating continuously in the protests,"" Ba Myo Thein said. ""Now, the relatives are trying to retrieve the body at the Military Hospital.""
Neither the military nor the police responded to calls for comment.
Zaw Myat Linn is the second NLD official to have died in custody in the last two days. Khin Maung Latt, who had worked as a campaign manager for an NLD MP elected in 2020, died after he was arrested on Saturday night.
The army has justified the coup by saying that a November election won by the NLD was marred by fraud - a claim rejected by the electoral commission. It has promised a new election, but has not said when that might be held.
International powers have condemned the takeover, which derailed a slow transition to democracy in a country that has been ruled by the military for long periods since independence from Britain in 1947.
CAUGHT IN A TRAP
In Yangon's Sanchaung district on Monday night, security forces trapped hundreds of youngsters who had taken part in earlier anti-coup demonstrations. 
Police firing guns and using stun grenades checked houses for anyone from outside the district and said they would punish anyone caught hiding. 
However, thousands of people took to the streets in support of the youths, and many managed to to slip away.
Activist Shar Ya Mone said she had been in a building with about 15 to 20 others, but had now been able to go home.
""There were many free car rides and people welcoming the protesters,"" Shar Ya Mone said by telephone.
She said she would keep demonstrating ""until the dictatorship ends"". 
The AAPP said around 50 people had been arrested in Sanchaung after police searched houses, though checks were still being made.
A junta spokesman did not answer calls requesting comment.
State television MRTV had said earlier: ""The government's patience has run out."" Most people wanted stability and stronger measures to the end the protests, it said.
Scattered protests were held in Yangon and other towns across Myanmar on Tuesday but were quickly broken up by security forces using tear gas and stun grenades. At least two people were wounded, one by a gunshot, in the town of Mohnyin in the north, local media said. 
The United States criticised the junta for stripping five independent media companies of their licences. The five - Mizzima, Myanmar Now, 7-Day, DVB and Khit Thit Media - have been active in covering protests against the coup.
Witnesses said two journalists from Kamayut, another independent media house, have been arrested and the offices of Mizzima News raided.
""We have very strongly condemned the junta for the... violent crackdowns on those peacefully taking to the streets and on those who are just doing their jobs, including independent journalists who have been swept up,"" the U.S. State Department said.
The military has brushed off condemnation of its actions, as it has in past periods of army rule when outbreaks of protest were bloodily repressed.
It is also under pressure from a civil disobedience movement that has crippled government business and from strikes at banks, factories and shops that have shut much of Yangon this week.
In a diplomatic blow to the junta, Myanmar's ambassador in Britain followed its U.N. representative in calling on Monday for the release of Suu Kyi. Britain, the United States and some other Western countries have imposed limited sanctions on the junta.

The European Union is preparing to widen its sanctions to target army-run businesses, according to diplomats and two internal documents seen by Reuters.

Fukushima was the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, the 1986 Soviet reactor explosion that sent radioactive dust across much of Europe. A 9.0-magnitude quake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, and more than 160,000 residents had to flee as radiation spewed into the air.
After Chernobyl, people living close to the plant were exposed to radioactive iodine through contaminated milk. The Japanese authorities took more effective action including evacuations that significantly reduced exposure. 
Two days before the 10th anniversary of the disaster, the U.N. Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), which comprises 52 scientists from 27 countries, published an update to a 2014 report, based on data up to the end of 2019.
""The updated (radiation) dose estimates to members of the public have either decreased or are comparable with the Scientific Committee's previous estimates,"" UNSCEAR said in a statement.
""The Committee therefore continues to consider that future health effects directly related to radiation exposure are unlikely to be discernible.""
There has, however, been an increase in thyroid cancers in children.
The thyroid - a gland in the neck that produces hormones - is the most exposed organ as radioactive iodine concentrates there. Children are especially vulnerable.
In a first round between 2011 and 2015, more than 300,000 people aged 18 and under in the Fukushima area were screened for thyroid cancer using highly sensitive ultrasound equipment, UNSCEAR said, revealing 116 cases of actual or suspected cancer.
A study using equivalent equipment in three prefectures not exposed to radiation from Fukushima found rates of thyroid cysts and nodules - possible indications of cancer - as high as those in the Fukushima screening, UNSCEAR added.
""On the balance of available evidence, the large increase ... in the number of thyroid cancers detected among exposed children is not the result of radiation exposure,"" UNSCEAR said. 

""Rather, they are the result of ultrasensitive screening procedures that have revealed the prevalence of thyroid abnormalities in the population not previously detected.""

""All of us must be respectful of the laws and policies of the host country Thailand,"" it said in an email seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
""We strongly urge members of the AIT community to take heed of the message issued by the government of Thailand.""

Rallies have taken place outside the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok and the regional headquarters of the United Nations, urging the body to take action. 
The memo did not specifically mention demonstrations about Myanmar, but said the request covers protests in ""Bangkok, United Nations, embassies"".
Thailand has also seen a resumption recently of youth-led protests against its government.
Thailand has called for restraint and dialogue in Myanmar, but has stopped short of criticising the military for seizing power.

""We are deeply worried that these latest killings indicate an escalation of violence, intimidation harassment and 'red tagging' of human rights defenders,"" U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a news briefing in Geneva.
An influential church group on Monday expressed alarm at the killings and concern about ""red-tagging"", or the labelling of opponents as communists or terrorists to justify targeting them.
Rights groups said those killed in Sunday's raids were activists, not combatants. 
Their deaths came two days after Duterte told security forces they could kill communist rebels if they were holding a gun, and to ""ignore human rights"".
Activists said the raids were reminiscent of thousands of deadly police operations under Duterte's bloody anti-drugs crackdown, in which police said all of the victims were armed and had resisted arrest.
Critics accuse Duterte of openly encouraging police to kill drug suspects. His office rejects that. 
Shamdasani urged police to ""take urgent measures to prevent the use of excessive force"" and the government and security forces to ""refrain from rhetoric that may lead to violations"". 
Shamdasani said an investigation must be ""conducted with a view to accountability"".

""The fact remains that most of the perpetrators of these human rights violations are enjoying impunity to this day,"" she said.

Like other Balkan countries aiming to become members of the European Union, Albania must demonstrate its readiness to protect human rights, and has passed laws against discrimination because of sexual orientation.
In a largely patriarchal society, however, those who are open about their sexual orientation are often judged by family and friends.
""Any kind of relationship that is not crowned with starting a family is totally unacceptable,"" Sara, who gave only her first name to protect her identity, told Reuters.
Sara said the dream of every LGBT person was ""to come out openly in a close social network or family"". Because of prejudice, however, some people like her opted to keep a low profile.
A survey by the Streha organisation which offers shelter to LGBT community members found that 80% of 200 LGBT respondents had considered leaving Albania.
A 2021 report by ILGA gay rights organisation, which bring together over 600 groups from 54 countries in Europe and Central Asia, said that discrimination against the LGBT population in Albania had increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Another study, by Abania's Alenacea non-governmental organisation, found one in two LGBT community members had experienced psychological violence and bullying, one in five had been sexually harassed and some had been raped, the ILGA report said. Only 7% reported the incidents to the authorities. 
""Another problem lies in access to health care,"" Xheni Karaj, an LGBT activist, told Reuters.

""When I took transgender people to the hospital, the doctors said why not let these people die.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Precisely two weeks after receiving her second COVID-19 vaccine shot, Sylvia Baer spent the day getting an eye exam, enjoying a manicure and buying groceries at Whole Foods - a schedule that 12 months ago would have been utterly unremarkable.
Yet the 71-year-old college professor found herself on the verge of tears at, of all places, the eye doctor's office - the first time in nearly a year she had stepped inside a building that was not her own home for more than a moment.
""I was so happy,"" she said, recalling how exciting it was to walk into her grocery store again in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. ""I left with five different desserts and three different kinds of olives.""
Across the United States, COVID-19 vaccinations are changing seniors' daily lives in ways large and small a year after the pandemic drove many in the high-risk group into forced isolation. Older Americans are again visiting family members, eating at their favorite restaurants and shopping in stores without fear of death or hospitalization.
The emergence of new, potentially more virulent variants of the coronavirus is causing some inoculated seniors to return to their routines with caution, however. And the weight of so many deaths among their peers, plus the psychological burden that accompanied months of quarantine, will not dissipate overnight. 
This week, Linda Dobrusin, 80, will welcome three friends – all of whom have also been vaccinated – into her home in Southfield, Michigan, to restart a weekly card game of canasta on hold since last spring.
The occasion is bittersweet for Dobrusin, who lost a lifelong friend to COVID-19 last year. The pandemic made a proper funeral impossible, so she watched the small graveside service via video. 
""It's hard to believe it's been a year, and yet it feels like forever,"" Dobrusin said.
For many seniors, the vaccine's biggest boon is allowing them to see relatives again, after missing out on weddings, births, graduations and holidays. Older Americans in particular, who often face health risks apart from the pandemic, have felt the loss of a full calendar year deeply.
Sharon Halper, 76, is scheduled to receive the second of two shots in mid-March. Two weeks after that – when researchers say the full effect of the vaccine is reached – she plans to cook a big meal and invite her grandsons for dinner at her home in Warwick, New York, including one who recently got engaged.
She intends to re-celebrate every missed holiday, starting with Hanukah and working her way back through the calendar.
""I can't wait to hug them again,"" said Halper, whose husband, David, celebrated his 80th birthday on Zoom. 
Lonnie Hanauer, 85, and his wife, Bette, are leaving their home in West Orange, New Jersey, this week and flying to Florida to visit their daughter, whom they haven't seen since Thanksgiving in 2019. Last year's Thanksgiving holiday was the first the couple spent alone, without their children, in more than a half-century.
""When you get old, you don't know how many more,"" he said.
MUNDANE BECOMES MOMENTOUS
Even mundane activities have taken on new significance for vaccinated seniors.
At the Pennswood Village retirement community in Newtown, Pennsylvania, people are now permitted to sit in groups of four at tables indoors and have face-to-face conversations.
Resident Judy Yaskin, 79, hopes dining will resume in the coming weeks – no more food in brown bags consumed alone in her apartment – and events such as lecture series and movies may also return.
""Who knew that eating lunch could seem so exciting?"" she said.
Some seniors are keeping certain activities off-limits, whether due to uncertainties about the vaccines' efficacy or lingering doubts after a year of worry and fear.
""I will not go to an indoor movie or an indoor restaurant,"" said Arlene Schimmel, a 70-year-old New York City resident. She said she would only visit with friends who were themselves vaccinated as well.
Caution remains warranted, experts say, as scientists are still studying the vaccines' effectiveness against variants of the coronavirus.
It is also unclear whether vaccinated individuals can still spread the infection to others, which is why for now even those who have received the shots should continue to wear masks and practice social distancing in public.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday released new guidelines for vaccinated individuals, saying they can safely meet indoors without masks in small groups but should still don masks in public and avoid large gatherings.
Some 60 million Americans, or 18.1% of the population, had received at least one vaccine dose as of Monday, according to CDC data. Nearly 55% of those individuals were 65 years or older. 
Jessica Justman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, said some people might feel confused at the dual messages from public health experts: vaccines protect against serious illness, but the need for safety measures remains paramount.
But she said the novel coronavirus remains so, with researchers still learning more every day.
For many older Americans, the vaccines nevertheless have ended a sense of anxiety that had become so ingrained they did not understand how profound it had grown.

""You don't realize it until you see the finish line,"" Halper said. ""You've got to keep going; you can't let yourself collapse. Once the lid starts coming off, it's like steam coming out of the pot all of a sudden.""

CANBERRA (Reuters) - A British-Australian academic who spent two years detained in Iran said on Tuesday she was kept in solitary confinement for seven months, in what she described as ""psychological torture"" that left her contemplating suicide.
Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who was detained in Iran in 2018 and sentenced to 10 years in prison on espionage charges, was released late last year in exchange for three Iranians who had been detained abroad.
Speaking for the first time publicly, Moore-Gilbert said she was kept in a 4 square meter cell with only a telephone to communicate with prison guards.
""You go completely insane. It is so damaging. I felt physical pain,"" Moore-Gilbert told Sky News Australia.
Moore-Gilbert, a specialist in Middle East politics at the University of Melbourne, said her mental health deteriorated after two weeks.
""I thought if I could, I would kill myself.""
After nine months imprisonment, Moore-Gilbert was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which she sought to oppose through a series of hunger strikes.
In her most daring opposition, however, Moore-Gilbert said she once attempted to escape.
""One day I was just like, ‘You know what? I’m going to do it. I have nothing to lose’,"" Moore-Gilbert told Sky News.
""There were spikes on part of the wall, so I just took some socks with me and put them over my hands and then grabbed onto them, hoping they weren’t too sharp.""
Once on the roof of the prison, Moore-Gilbert said she could have scaled down the walls and made a run for a nearby town. However, she said she decided not to proceed as she was in a prison uniform, didn't speak the local language and feared the consequences of being caught.
Eventually she was released in a prisoner swap and back in Australia, Moore-Gilbert said she is focused on her recovery.

The rains led to the cresting of the Kaupakalua dam in the island's northern region of Haiku, state emergency management officials said in a statement. 
""Failure of the dam will produce life-threatening flooding as well as significant property damage in areas downstream,"" weather officials in Honolulu, the state capital, said in a statement.
Evacuation shelters were being opened at a community centre and a high school, Governor David Ige said. 
""Maui county officials have been informed that Kaupakalua dam has been breached,"" Ige said on Twitter late on Monday, announcing that evacuations had begun.
Maui Mayor Michael Victorino said six homes were heavily damaged or destroyed after the dam flooded the Haiku area. Two bridges were also destroyed, a reporter for Fox affiliate KHON2 News said on Twitter.
The earthen dam, dating from 1885, is 57 feet (17.4 m) high and 400 feet (122 m) long, and belongs to the East Maui Irrigation Co.
The owners received a deficiency notice about the dam last year from the state, KHON2 News said in a report. It was one of nine cited as being in poor or unsatisfactory condition.
The state land department is charged with inspecting about 135 registered dams statewide. 

In 2006, seven people died after the Ka Loko dam collapsed on the island of Kauai.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Ted Hui has arrived in Australia where his family will settle after the Australian government provided an exemption to its closed border policy and assistance with flights, he said on Tuesday.
A former Democratic party lawmaker, Hui left Hong Kong late last year after facing criminal charges over the 2019 pro-democracy protests.
His arrival in Australia comes as 47 pro-democracy activists have been charged in Hong Kong with conspiracy to commit subversion under a new national security law, because they participated in an unofficial primary last July to select the strongest candidates for a legislative council election. 
Hui, a member of the legislative council since 2016, was preselected to represent Hong Kong island for the election.
He said it had been painful to watch in the past week as his close colleagues were jailed after being denied bail in marathon hearings in the subversion case.
""As a participant in the primary election and a winner, I see it as a ridiculous act and unreasonable for the regime to put any accusation on us when it was totally peaceful,"" he told Reuters in a telephone interview. He is undergoing a 14-day mandatory quarantine after arriving in Australia on Monday.
""It is only because it is against Beijing's will that people are thrown into jail."" 
Hui said he had decided to move to Australia from Britain, where he has spent the past three months, to spread the international reach of the pro-democracy activists.
""I feel more responsible now as an exile to tell the world how ridiculous it is,"" he said.
Hui said during the interview that the coronavirus pandemic was stable in Australia, and he would be able to undertake face-to-face lobbying work.
In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Tuesday announcing his move, Hui said that Australia and New Zealand are important members of the Five Eye intelligence sharing group that also includes the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, which have endorsed the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. 
""I hope that my lobbying work will make the two countries tougher against China, have stronger support and actions towards the freedom of Hong Kong,"" he said in the post.
As part of his lobbying, Hui told Reuters he would also seek more flexible visas for Hong Kong people seeking to come to Australia.
Hui said he was grateful to the Australian government for granting a visa and a place on a repatriation flight from London. He said he did not intend to apply for political asylum.
Australia's home affairs office said it did not comment on individual cases.
Jane Poon, a representative of pro-democracy community group Australia Hong Kong Link, said Hui's arrival would encourage Australia's large Hong Kong community.
""He would be able to contribute a lot in lobbying work, especially as Australia has been a main battlefield against the (Chinese Communist Party),"" Poon told Reuters.

Hong Kong police ordered HSBC to freeze Hui's bank accounts in December after he said he would go into exile in Britain to continue his pro-democracy activities.

Christa Wirthumer-Hoche, the head of EMA's management board, told a talk show on Austrian broadcaster ORF on March 7 that she advised European Union countries against granting Sputnik V a national emergency authorisation while EMA was still reviewing the Russian vaccine's safety and effectiveness. 
""We demand a public apology from EMA's Christa Wirthumer-Hoche for her negative comments on EU states directly approving Sputnik V,"" the vaccine developers wrote on the official Sputnik V Twitter account. 
""Her comments raise serious questions about possible political interference in the ongoing EMA review,"" they said.
The developers added that the vaccine had already been approved by 46 countries.
""After postponing Sputnik V review for months, EMA does not have the right to undermine (the) credibility of 46 other regulators that reviewed all of the necessary data,"" Sputnik V's developers said. 
Sputnik V has already been approved or is being assessed for approval in three EU member states - Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. EU officials have said Brussels could start negotiations with a vaccine maker if at least four member countries request it.
Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which markets Sputnik V abroad, told Italian television on Sunday it was collaborating with pharmaceutical company Adienne to produce the vaccine in Italy. 
The Italian-Russian Chamber of Commerce later said there were plans for production to start in Italy in June and that the deal paved the way to create the first Sputnik V production facility in Europe. 

EMA earlier this month said it would review data from ongoing trials of the vaccine until there was enough evidence for a formal marketing authorisation application.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Parliament has voted to strip the immunity from prosecution from Carles Puigdemont and two other Catalan separatist lawmakers Spain has charged with sedition.
The chamber announced on Tuesday that EU lawmakers had voted clearly in favour of waiving the immunity of Catalonia's former regional head of government and two former cabinet members, Toni Comin and Clara Ponsati.
Puigdemont and Comin, who are in self-imposed exile in Belgium, formally became members of the European Parliament in June 2019, while Ponsati, who is in Scotland, was officially a member from January 2020.
All are subject to European arrest warrants issued by Spain which is seeking their extradition related to their role in organising a 2017 independence referendum deemed illegal by a Spanish court.
Belgium has so far denied Spain's requests. A court in January refused to extradite Lluis Puig, another former member of the Catalan government living in Belgium, over charges of misuse of public funds. 
Various independence leaders were convicted in Spain of the same charge of sedition in 2019 and sentenced to up to 13 years in prison.
The European Parliament noted in a report issued before the vote on Monday that the acts and prosecution pre-date their becoming members of the parliament in June 2019 and for Ponsati in January 2020.
It also said it was for national judicial systems of EU countries to determine criminal proceedings.

Parliament's legal affairs committee voted last month that immunity from prosecution should be waived. In each case, the vote was 15 in favour, eight against and two abstentions.

Netanyahu, who has said 90% of eligible Israelis have either received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine or recovered from the virus, has made Israel's vaccination programme a showcase of his campaign for re-eection on March 23.
Last week Israel, Austria and Denmark said they would set up a joint research and development fund, and possibly production facilities for COVID-19 vaccines, to ensure they had long-term supplies for booster shots or to contend with virus mutations.

The visit comes as the United States is seeking to shake-up the stalled Qatari-hosted talks between the warring sides, including proposals for an interim government.
U.N. Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan Deborah Lyons was also expected to with meet U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad and Qatari officials during the visit, the sources said.
These are crucial meetings as the outcome will decide the fate of year-long talks in Doha whether they should be continued or put under a moratorium, one of the sources said. 
With peace negotiations in the Qatari capital making little progress and violence in Afghanistan escalating, the United States is trying to build consensus around alternative options with all Afghan sides and key regional players.
Khalilzad has visited Afghanistan, Pakistan and Qatar over the past week.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration signed a troop withdrawal deal with the Taliban in February 2020 under which all international forces were expected to leave the country by May 1. 
However, violence has risen and NATO officials say some conditions of the deal, including the Taliban cutting ties with international militant groups, have not been met, which the Taliban disputes.
The U.S. government said on Sunday that all options remain on the table for its remaining 2,500 troops in Afghanistan and that it had made no decisions about its military commitment after May 1.

The State Department comments came after reports emerged that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had made a new urgent push for a U.N.-led peace effort, warning the U.S. military was considering exiting Afghanistan by May 1.

The companies said researcher Adrian Zenz's reports were untrue, damaged the reputation of the industry and led to economic losses after the United States banned cotton imports from Xinjiang, according to a report on by the Xinjiang Communist Party website on Monday evening.
Monday's report on the lawsuit did not include details of which companies were behind the civil action nor how much they were seeking in compensation and Reuters was not immediately able to review a copy of any legal filing.
The report said the suit was filed in what it called a local Xinjiang court, but didn't say when the filing was made. The Xinjiang government did not immediately respond to a request for more details on the case on Tuesday.
Experts said if it the suit would be the first known instance of a foreign researcher facing civil action in China over human rights research that has contributed to pressure for economic sanctions, and comes as Beijing has been stepping up its defence against foreign accusations of human rights abuses, which it denies.
The administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump in December banned imports of cotton from Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), which produces around 30% of China's cotton. In January it announced an import ban on all cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang over allegations that they were made with forced labour, without citing the source of the allegations. 
XPCC could not be reached for comment by Reuters on Tuesday.
""It (the suit) would seem to be a tactic to try to raise the costs for those doing research on these kinds of severe human rights abuses,"" said Sarah Cook, New York-based Research Director for China at U.S. non-profit Freedom House. 
""It could set a worrisome precedent ... it could send a signal to foreign companies or others who might be considering being more outspoken or changing business practices due to what is happening in Xinjiang,"" she said.
Zenz is a senior fellow in China studies at the U.S.-based Victims of Communism Foundation, a non-profit that researches human rights in communist countries, and a critic of China's ethnic policy in Xinjiang and Tibet whose research has been widely cited in western media, including Reuters.
Zenz said the lawsuit shows that his research is having an impact, although he believes the case is symbolic. He said he had last been in China more than a decade ago and has no intention of returning to China in the immediate future.
""That's probably the most direct statement that some of these companies are incurring economic losses as the result of my publication,"" he told Reuters on Tuesday. He said he had no knowledge of the contents of the suit.
Zen in December published a report that estimated around half a million people from ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang are employed in cotton picking through coercive labour transfer programmes. The research was based on an analysis of Chinese government documents and state media.
Last July, state media reported that Beijing was considering suing Zenz for libelling China, though no public information has since been released on any potential case and Zenz has not heard of any suit.

On Monday, China's parliament said it will speed up lawmaking aimed at countering foreign sanctions and ""long-arm jurisdiction"" amid increasing pressure from Western countries over issues ranging from Xinjiang to civil rights in Hong Kong.

(Reuters) - The next launch window for a NASA crew to the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX rocket has been pushed back by at least another two days, to no earlier than April 22, the space agency said.
SpaceX, the private rocket company of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, had been scheduled to carry its second ""operational"" space station team into orbit for NASA in late March from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. But NASA announced in January that the target date had slipped to April 20.
The schedule was adjusted again on the basis of available flight times to the space station, driven by orbital mechanics, that would keep the astronauts' need for sleep shifting to a minimum, NASA spokesman Dan Huot said on Monday.
The flight marks only the second full-fledged space station crew-rotation mission launched aboard a private company's spacecraft - a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket tipped with the Crew Dragon capsule it will carry into orbit.
The four-member SpaceX Crew-2 consists of two NASA astronauts, mission commander Shane Kimbrough and pilot Megan McArthur, along with Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide and fellow mission specialist Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency.
After docking with the space station, they will join the four SpaceX Crew-1 astronauts who arrived in November, and cosmonauts carried to the orbiting outpost aboard a Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft.
The newly arrived Crew-2 are to remain in orbit six months, while Crew-1 is due to return to earth by early May.

McArthur will become the second person from her family to ride a Crew Dragon into space. Her husband, Bob Behnken, was one of two NASA astronauts on the first manned Crew Dragon launch, a trial flight last August marking NASA's first human orbital mission from U.S. soil in nine years, following the end of the space shuttle program in 2011.

TOKYO (Reuters) - When a huge earthquake and tsunami struck Japan on March 11, 2011, devastating towns and triggering nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima, a stunned world watched the chaotic struggle to contain the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.
An onslaught of waves sparked by the 9.0-magnitude quake crashed into the northeastern coast, killing nearly 20,000 people and crippling the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant. More than 160,000 residents fled as radiation spewed into the air.
At the time, some - including Prime Minister Naoto Kan - feared Tokyo would need to be evacuated, or worse.
""Fukushima is stamped for the rest of the history of nuclear energy,"" said Kiyoshi Kurokawa, head of an investigation that concluded the disaster was ""profoundly man-made"".
The government has spent about $300 billion (32.1 trillion yen) to rebuild the tsunami-devastated Tohoku region, but areas around the Fukushima plant remain off-limits, worries about radiation levels linger and many who left have settled elsewhere. Decommissioning of the crippled plant will take decades and billions of dollars.
Japan is again debating the role of nuclear power in its energy mix as the resource-poor country aims to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2050 to fight global warming. But an NHK public TV survey showed 85% of the public worries about nuclear accidents.
Energy policy was left in limbo after Shinzo Abe led his pro-nuclear energy Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) back to power the year after the disaster, ousting the novice Democratic Party of Japan, whose image was tainted by its handling of Fukushima.
""They sort of left things adrift,"" said Tobias Harris, senior vice president at consultancy Teneo and author of a book about Abe. 
'RESULT OF COLLUSION'
Kurokawa's commission, appointed by parliament, concluded in 2012 that the Fukushima accident was ""the result of collusion between the government, regulators and Tokyo Electric Power Co"" and a lack of governance.
Abe resigned last year, citing poor health, and his successor, Yoshihide Suga, has announced a goal of net carbon neutrality by 2050.
Proponents say nuclear power is vital to decarbonization. Critics say cost, safety and the challenge of storing nuclear waste are all reasons to avoid it.
""Those talking about atomic power are people in the 'nuclear village', who want to protect their vested interests,"" former Prime Minister Kan told a news conference last week. 
The mass demonstrations against nuclear power seen in the wake of 3/11 have faded, but distrust lingers.
A February Asahi newspaper survey found that nationwide, 53% are opposed to restarting reactors, compared with 32% in favour. In Fukushima, only 16% backed bringing restarting units.
""Ten years have passed and some people have forgotten. The zeal is gone,"" said Yu Uchiyama, a University of Tokyo political science professor. ""Restarts are not happening, so people think if they just wait, nuclear power will disappear.""
NUCLEAR FUTURE BLEAK?
Only nine of Japan's 33 remaining commercial reactors have been approved for restarts under post-Fukushima safety standards and only four are operating, compared with 54 before the disaster.
Nuclear power supplied just 6% of Japan's energy needs in the first half of 2020 compared with 23.1% for renewable sources - far behind Germany's 46.3% - and nearly 70% for fossil fuels.
Extending the lifespan of Japan's 33 existing commercial reactors to 60 years, there would be only 18 in 2050 and none by 2069, said Takeo Kikkawa, an adviser to the government on energy policy. Newer business lobbies are pushing for renewable energy.
""Japan is a resource-poor country so we should not casually abandon the nuclear option,"" Kikkawa told a media briefing. ""But in reality, the future of nuclear power is bleak.""

More than one million doses of the vaccine arrived late on Monday via the COVAX global vaccine-alliance scheme. About 38 million doses of a vaccine produced by China's Sinovac Biotech have arrived in the Southeast Asian country so far, some of which have been used in a mass inoculation drive starting in January.

975,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 01:16AM ET</span>",Talks start to protect Indian Ocean's depleting tuna,"(Reuters) - Representatives of 30 nations meet on Tuesday to seek ways to save fast-depleting tuna stocks in the Indian Ocean as demand in Asia and the West soars for sushi and tinned fish. 
The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), which groups coastal countries from Australia to Kenya plus major fishing region the European Union, was convening virtually over five days to debate yellowfin tuna quotas.
Environmentalists say the warm water species is at risk of depletion as over-fishing compounds other threats from climate change and pollution. 
There is corporate concern too: British supermarkets Tesco (OTC:TSCDD) and Co-op and Belgian retailer Colruyt pledged last year to stop buying Indian Ocean yellowfin unless the U.N.-mandated commission adopts a plan to rebuild stocks.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature has for nearly a decade had the species on its ""Red List"". 
Yet the total global catch has risen by about a third, to nearly 450,000 metric tons annually, according to the London-based Blue Marine Foundation advocacy group. 
It estimates yellowfin tuna stocks could ""collapse"" - meaning they would go beyond the minimum size needed for recovery - within the next five years if the catch is not cut.
French and Spanish fishing fleets take the majority of fish, using industrial methods such as ""purse seine"" with huge nets that often net juvenile yellowfin yet to begin reproducing.
'DELAY COULD BE CATASTROPHIC'
Coastal nations want to limit Europe's distant-water fleets.
Kenya and Sri Lanka, for example, want more curbs on devices such as fish aggregators: floating objects that attract tuna and other species towards nets.
""They are the visitors,"" said Will McCallum, Head of Oceans at environmental group Greenpeace UK, of the European fleets. ""They are fishing at a far larger capacity than anybody else, and it's not an equitable state of affairs."" 
The Maldives wants the yellowfin catch to be cut by 15% from 2015 levels, when IOTC scientists first agreed they were being overfished. 
The IOTC had last year recommended cutting the catch by 20% from 2014 levels, but rowed back in January, saying that was distorted by projections from the 2018 stock assessment.
Given that a new stock assessment will not be ready until the end of 2021, the commission may postpone new measures, according to the Blue Marine Foundation.
""For a stock that is at risk of collapse, this delay could prove catastrophic,"" it said in a statement.
The European Union proposes a total catch reduction from nearly 438,000 metric tons in 2019 to around 380,000.
Demand for yellowfin is booming as its light meat is widely used for tinned fish and in sushi in North America, Europe and Asia. The global yellowfin market in 2018 was worth $15.8 billion, the second-highest value of the seven tuna species, according to a report by the world's largest canned tuna company, Thai Union Group PCL.

Greenpeace's McCallum said the over-fishing issue had stalled during the COVID-19 pandemic and drastic action was needed now to avoid irrecoverable damage to the species.

Deputy Commissioner of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong Song Ru'an told reporters the proposed changes were an internal matter for China and were needed to ""close obvious loopholes and deficiencies"" in the city's political system.
China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), is expected to approve on Thursday a resolution that will reduce democratic representation in Hong Kong institutions and vet any candidates for ""patriotism"".
The measures will tweak the size and composition of Hong Kong's legislature and the electoral committee selecting the chief executive further in favour of pro-Beijing figures. The committee will also be given powers to select many legislators.
It was ""solely China’s internal affair on how to design and improve the system,"" Song said, adding ""destabilising forces"" had taken advantage of ""loopholes"" in the past.
Critics have decried Beijing's moves as the end of democratic dreams in the former British colony, whose mini-constitution states universal suffrage as its goal.
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms that pro-democracy activists, who brought parts of the city to frequent halts in sometimes violent protests in 2019, say are being whittled away by Communist Party rulers in Beijing.
Only half of its legislature is currently picked through democratic vote, a proportion which will shrink under the new system. Other seats in the legislature and the electoral committee taken by lower-level, democratically elected district council officials, are expected to be scrapped.
The changes to the electoral system follow a series of moves by Beijing to reassert its control over China's most restive city and set it on an increasingly authoritarian path. 
China imposed a sweeping national security law in June 2020 and authorities have since arrested most high-profile opposition politicians and activists for offences under the new law or related to the 2019 protests.

Song said China wanted to create a new ""democratic"" electoral system, which will ""fully respect"" the public's democratic rights. He did not elaborate.

PIERRE, S.D. (Reuters) - The South Dakota House of Representatives voted on Monday to halt impeachment proceedings against the state attorney general over his conduct in a fatal car crash last year while he still faces unresolved criminal charges from the accident.
The lawmakers voted 57-11 vote to suspend further impeachment action against the state's top law enforcement official, Republican Jason Ravnsborg. The move marks a sharp turnaround after both Democratic and Republican politicians had called for his ouster. 
The clamor reached its peak last month after state authorities took the extraordinary step of releasing video of police interrogations of the attorney general and other evidence from the Sept. 12 crash, in which his car struck and killed a man walking along a highway. 
In the video, Ravnsborg told police he believed he had run into a deer, rather than a person, until he returned to the scene the following day to find the body of the victim, 55-year-old Joe Boever, lying in a roadside ditch. 
Investigators suggested that Ravnsborg's account lacked credibility, telling him under questioning that a broken pair of eyeglasses belonging to Boever were found in his car, indicating the victim's face had gone through the windshield on impact.
Police also told Ravnsborg that Boever had been carrying a flashlight, which was still illuminated when they found it the next day, and that evidence showed Ravnsborg had driven onto the shoulder of the road where the victim was walking. 
The video sparked immediate outrage. Governor Kristi Noem, a fellow Republican, demanded the resignation of Ravnsborg, who is charged with three misdemeanor offenses in the accident. A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced an impeachment resolution in the state's Republican-controlled House of Representatives.
But a state judge on Feb. 25 ordered the police interrogation video and other evidence sealed, ruling that its disclosure violated Ravnsborg's due process rights.
The court order prompted legislative leaders to introduce amendments to the impeachment articles barring further House proceedings against Ravnsborg at least until the criminal case against him is resolved. 
""The House's action today will allow the legal system to proceed without further interference and with due process,"" Ravnsborg said in a statement issued on Monday through his lawyer.

Ravnsborg, who has denied wrongdoing and refused to resign, is due to make his initial court appearance in the case on Friday.

ASUNCION (Reuters) - Thousands of Paraguayans gathered around Congress in downtown Asunción on Monday, marking the fourth day of protests amid calls to impeach President Mario Abdo over the government's handling of the COVID-19 health crisis.
The protesters, many wearing soccer jerseys and carrying national flags, chanted ""Out Marito"" and ""Everyone out"", while criticizing the authorities for the lack of medicines and intensive care beds amid a spike in coronavirus cases.
""In the hospitals there are no syringes, there are no beds,"" a young man who identified himself as Dudu Dávalos told local television after traveling from the city of Hernandarias, 340 km (210 miles) east of Asunción. 
""They had a year to prepare and did nothing.""
A protest on Friday had ended in a pitched battle after police used gas and rubber bullets. On Saturday and Sunday, less intense demonstrations shifted to the area near the presidential residence, in an affluent neighborhood of Asunción.
Protesters and some lawmakers have called for Abdo to be impeached, though he still appears to have enough support to see off any challenge. However, he has been forced to shuffle his cabinet ""in the interest of pacification"".
On Monday he appointed a new Chief of Staff and confirmed doctor Julio Borba as the new health minister.
An impeachment trial could only advance with the support of a group led by former President Horacio Cartes within the ruling Colorado Party. Its lawmakers said they would analyze the changes Abdo promised before making a decision.
Paraguay early last year had kept infections very low, but COVID-19 cases jumped since September as activities resumed and have reached record numbers this month.
The Health Ministry reported on Monday a new daily record of 1,817 cases and 25 deaths, which raised the total number of infections to 169,870 and deaths to 3,343.

Latin America has seen a number of prominent health ministers forced out due to their handling of the pandemic, including in Peru, Argentina and Ecuador.

WASHINGTON/KABUL (Reuters) - A U.S.-drafted peace plan for Afghanistan, reviewed by Reuters on Monday, calls for the current government to be replaced with an interim administration until a new constitution is agreed and elections held, while a joint commission monitors a ceasefire.
The warring parties have long harbored deep objections to key ideas in the proposal, however.
The U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, shared the ""Transitional Peace Government"" proposal last week with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, opposition and civil society leaders, and Taliban negotiators. 
Under the interim government, the national parliament could either be expanded to include Taliban members or suspended until after the election, the plan suggests. It also says that Afghanistan could ""not host terrorists or permit terrorist-related activity on its soil"" that threatens other countries, and that the Taliban would have to abandon safe havens and military ties ""in neighboring countries.""
Four political sources in Kabul who spoke on condition of anonymity, including a senior presidential palace official, confirmed the authenticity of a copy of the draft plan seen by Reuters. The plan has been reported by TOLO News and other Afghan outlets.
State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters on Monday: ""Every idea we have put on the table, every proposal that is out there ... we understand that this process, at its core, must be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned."" 
The new U.S. administration of President Joe Biden wants to revive stalled peace talks before May 1, when the last 2,500 U.S. troops must leave Afghanistan under a February 2020 deal struck between the Taliban and the former Trump administration.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week proposed in a letter to Afghan leaders that Turkey hold a senior-level meeting ""in the coming weeks to finalize a peace agreement.""
INTERIM GOVERNMENT 
Ghani has refused to step aside for a transitional government. The senior presidential palace official in Kabul echoed that on Monday: ""We will never accept an interim set-up through a conference or a political deal.""
The Taliban have rejected a ceasefire and elections. But a Taliban leader told Reuters that while the insurgents would not join an interim government, they were not opposed to one being formed. 
The U.S. draft calls for the establishment of a transitional government, including an ""executive administration"" chosen by the sides, ""with special consideration for the meaningful inclusion of women and members of all ethnic groups.""
The interim administration – under a president chosen by both sides – would run the country until elections could be held under a constitution drafted by a commission selected by both sides and the president.
A nationwide ceasefire would be monitored by a joint commission, with each side selecting four members and a ninth named by the interim president. Three international observers would work with the commission, the draft says.
Laurel Miller, a former acting U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said the most ""contentious"" aspect of the U.S. plan is how power would be apportioned within the transitional government. 

Miller, who now works with the International Crisis Group, a conflict resolution organization, added that Taliban leaders ""haven't even revealed their starting positions in any substance, much less contemplated something like this.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department arrested another alleged associate of the anti-government Oath Keepers militia on charges he took part in the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol, 6, and a judge granted him bail on Monday, rejecting government requests to keep him detained. 
According to court papers, Roberto Minuta, 36, who owns a tattoo shop in Newburgh, New York, ""berated and taunted"" U.S. Capitol Police while clad in military-style gear, then attacked the Capitol and disrupted Congress as it was certifying President Joe Biden's election victory.
Minuta later deleted a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account to ""conceal his involvement in these offenses,"" the court papers said.
Bail was set at $150,000 by U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew Krause at a hearing in White Plains, New York, two days after the defendant's arrest. 
Krause said that while the charges were ""most certainly"" serious, he saw no evidence Minuta had committed violence, and that prosecutors may have overstated the risk of violence because he had worn military-style gear.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Gianforti said Minuta was a danger to the community and should have been held in custody, arguing he had been ""spoiling for a fight of some kind,"" and that whatever motivated him ""has not been washed from his mind.""
Gianforti also said Minuta had an ""apparent love of firearms,"" with 10 guns registered to his name and one on his person when he was arrested.
A federal public defender, Ben Gold, countered that gun ownership was no reason to detain Minuta, and that the defendant was planning to sell the guns. Krause ordered that Minuta get rid of his guns by Tuesday.
Krause said the defendant may travel between New York and Texas, where his wife and two children live. He faces charges of obstructing an official proceeding, unlawful entry and tampering with documents.
Minuta is the latest alleged associate of the Oath Keepers to face charges for his role in the Capitol riots, in which more than 100 police officers were assaulted, one was killed, and the Capitol suffered millions of dollars in damages.
Last month, a grand jury indicted nine associates of the Oath Keepers on charges they conspired to prevent Congress from certifying Biden's election victory. Several of them have since pleaded not guilty.
""Minuta stormed the Capitol grounds and was photographed standing in a crowd of rioters near a Capitol entrance, filming U.S. Capitol police officers with a mobile cellular phone,"" the charging documents say. 
""Eventually, Minuta unlawfully breached the Capitol building itself.""
Later, as he exited, he was caught on video shouting to police: ""All that’s left is the Second Amendment!”
An FBI affidavit, which includes photographs of a bearded Minuta at the Capitol, carries a link to a Feb. 14 story from the New York Times about Oath Keepers associates who guarded veteran Republican operative and Trump supporter Roger Stone on Jan. 5 or 6, and later entered the Capitol during the riots.
The story features photographs of six Oath Keepers who allegedly guarded Stone and participated in the riots. One of those six resembles Minuta.
In a statement, Stone said that while some Oath Keepers provided him with security at several Jan. 5 rallies, he had no advance knowledge of the riots and was not involved in them.
""I do not know Mr. Minuta nor was I familiar with his name prior to his being identified in earlier media stories where it was alleged that he was involved in illegal events up at the Capitol,"" Stone said. 

Stone said he has publicly denounced the attack on the Capitol and believes anyone involved should be prosecuted.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The family of a Black man who died of asphyxiation last year while in police custody in Rochester, New York, charged the city on Monday with wrongfully causing his death, failing to properly train its officers and not holding them accountable.
In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Rochester, the estate of Daniel Prude accused officers of causing his death when they restrained him on the ground while he was naked during an apparent mental health crisis.
""The actions of these Defendants in forcing him to lay naked on the freezing pavement for a long period of time and taunting him while he begged for help was intentional and/or reckless,"" said the 27-page complaint filed by one of Prude's five children, Nathaniel McFarland, on behalf of his estate.
Besides the city, the complaint, which supersedes an earlier lawsuit filed by one of McFarland's siblings, names several officers as defendants.
A spokesman for the city declined to comment but confirmed in an email that the officers involved remain suspended during an ongoing internal investigation.
Last month, a grand jury declined to indict any of the officers after an investigation into Prude's death led by state Attorney General Letitia James.
The pre-dawn incident on March 23 did not come to light until September when family members released body-worn camera video that went viral.
The revelation followed other deaths of Black people at the hands of police, most notably George Floyd who died with an officer's knee on his neck in a Minneapolis street. 
The lawsuit accused three of the officers of using the ""deadly force"" of their body weight to cause Prude's death while he was on the ground. Prude, 41, stopped breathing minutes later and died a week later when he was taken off life support. 

The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory damages for Prude's physical and emotional pain and suffering.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration is granting temporary protected status to Venezuelan migrants living in the United States and is also working to coordinate international pressure against President Nicolas Maduro to hold free and fair elections, senior U.S. officials said on Monday.
The decision, which could aid an estimated 320,000 people, fulfills a promise that President Joe Biden made during the 2020 election campaign to give shelter to Venezuelans who left their homeland amid economic collapse, humanitarian crisis and political turmoil under Maduro.
Venezuelans in the United States will have to show they have been residing in the country continuously as of March 8, 2021, to qualify for the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation, the officials told reporters. If they meet the criteria, they will be given an 18-month reprieve to stay and can also obtain work permits.
The decision stems from “extraordinary temporary conditions” in Venezuela, including “widespread hunger and malnutrition, growing presence and influence of non-state armed groups, a crumbling infrastructure,” one official said.
“It is not safe for them to return,” the official added.
Some 5.4 million Venezuelans have emigrated in recent years, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
When Biden took office on Jan. 20, he inherited from his predecessor, Donald Trump, an array of harsh sanctions that further tightened the economic noose on the OPEC state but failed to unseat Maduro.
One of the administration officials reiterated the White House position, reported by Reuters late last month, that Biden is in “no rush” to lift sanctions on Venezuela.
But the official stressed that Biden was moving away from the mostly unilateral approach of Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign and coordinating more closely with international partners to force Maduro to hold free and fair elections.
The official insisted that Maduro and his loyalists will find “no quarter anywhere” until they negotiate in earnest with the opposition. However, Maduro has shown no signs of giving ground.
At the same time, the official said, Washington is reviewing Venezuela sanctions to make sure they are effective against intended targets and not “unnecessarily” punishing the Venezuelan people.
Biden’s administration is continuing to recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president. Dozens of countries have backed Guaido’s claim following Maduro’s re-election in 2018 in a vote Western governments called a sham, though cracks recently have appeared in Guaido's international support.
The Trump administration had resisted granting TPS to Venezuelans despite calls from Democrats and some Republicans. But on his last full day in office Trump issued an order temporarily blocking deportations of Venezuelans.
Monday's announcement appeared aimed in part at clearing up confusion surrounding Trump's last-minute move and providing Venezuelans with formal legal status.

Trump largely sought to phase out TPS for immigrants but was stymied by legal challenges. Biden has moved to reverse Trump's hardline immigration policies.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Women across Mexico geared up for marches to mark International Women's Day on Monday, driven by anger that President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has backed a politician accused of rape at a time when the country is suffering rampant gender violence.
Activists in recent days have displayed a purple banner declaring ""no abuser in power"" across Mexico City's main plaza, renamed streets with women's names pasted over signs and used purple, green and pink on social media avatars. 
At the national palace, where Lopez Obrador resides, protesters painted the names of hundreds of femicide victims across 10-foot-tall (3-meter) metal barriers that were erected last week to protect the historic building from vandalism during Monday's marches. 
Activists also projected feminist slogans in bright lights across the barricaded palace facade, including a message saying ""a rapist will not be governor,"" effectively turning the riot control measures into a monument against perceived government apathy toward violence against women. 
Lopez Obrador has for weeks stood by his party's candidate in midterm elections in June for governor of Guerrero state, Felix Salgado, describing the calls for him to step down over rape allegations as politically motivated. 
Guerrero prosecutors are investigating one accusation of rape against Salgado, after earlier this year dropping a probe into another accusation that they say was filed too long after the alleged crime. 
Salgado has denied the allegations, Mexican media have reported.
Lopez Obrador said on Monday that more women are participating in politics than ever before, including nine ministers, and defended his government's unprecedented move to surround the palace with barriers as a way to discourage violent demonstrations without provoking clashes with riot police. 
""There are lots of ways to protest peacefully, like shouting and even insulting,"" he told his regular news conference. ""But not throwing bombs, not using hammers, not setting fires.""

Thousands of women flocked to the streets a year ago to demand a tougher government response against femicides, with some demonstrators chucking molotov cocktails at the national palace and vandalizing buildings in what were otherwise peaceful protests.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian Supreme Court judge on Monday annulled the criminal convictions against former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a move that could allow the popular politician to run in next year's presidential election.
The decision roiled financial markets and scrambled forecasts for the 2022 race, with many investors betting it would polarize voters between President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right populist, and Lula, his greatest opponent on the left.
In a surprise decision, Justice Edson Fachin said that a court in the southern city of Curitiba did not have the authority to try Lula on corruption charges and that he must be retried in federal courts in the capital Brasilia.
The office of Brazil's prosecutor general said it will appeal the decision, which will also be reviewed by the full Supreme Court.
Brazil's real sank around 1.5% to a fresh four-month low after the news and the Bovespa stock index fell 3%. The real closed at 5.7779 per dollar, its weakest since May last year.
Financial analysts said the prospect of Lula candidacy would likely drive Bolsonaro to abandon economic reforms he ran on in 2018 and further embrace populist measures to shore up support. 
""With Lula eligible, the chance of this current government going totally towards populism increases even more,"" said Alfredo Menezes, managing partner at Armor Capital.
Lula governed Latin America's most populous country and largest economy between 2003 and 2011, overseeing a commodities boom that turbocharged economic growth.
In 2018, he was convicted of taking bribes from engineering firms in return for public contracts and spent a year and a half behind bars, until the Supreme Court ruled he and others could appeal their cases without serving time. 
Lula has maintained his innocence and said the case against him was politically motivated. His conviction had prevented him from running for another presidential term.
The charismatic former union leader is a polarizing figure but still beloved by much of Brazil’s working class for bringing millions out of poverty through generous social welfare programs.
Lula is the only one of 10 potential 2022 candidates who outperformed Bolsonaro in a survey by polling company Ipec, published in newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo last week. 

It found that 50% of the 2,002 people it interviewed ""would certainly"" or ""could"" vote for Lula, compared with 38% for Bolsonaro. Some 44% of respondents said they would never vote for Lula, while 56% would never vote for Bolsonaro, the poll found.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - More than 11,000 people have been displaced from their homes by fighting between Colombian armed groups so far in 2021 - equivalent to seven people every hour - the country's human rights ombudsman said on Monday.
Crime gangs, the leftist National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas and former members of the FARC rebels who reject a peace deal fight each other and the armed forces for control of drug trafficking and illegal mining areas, largely in places inhabited by Black and indigenous Colombians.
""There were 16 urban mass displacements events and 14 rural mass displacements events which affected a total of 4,062 families, 11,150 people,"" ombudsman Carlos Camargo said in a statement. ""90% (of those displaced) belong to ethnic communities from the Colombian Pacific.""
There were 28,509 people displaced and 90 mass displacement events last year, figures from the ombudsman's office show.
Forty communities in the Pacific provinces of Choco, Cauca and Narino have this year suffered ""confinements"" because of territorial disputes between armed groups, the statement said.
The port city of Buenaventura was a hub for urban displacement, as local gangs fought for control of maritime drug trafficking routes to the United States.
""These are events which terrorize the population with targeted homicides, recruitment and use of children and adolescents, threats and in general, practices of population subjugation and control.""
The administration of President Ivan Duque has repeatedly promised to fight the illegal armed groups which it blames for the murders of human rights and community activists and recent mass killings.

At least 615 people were injured in the blasts on Sunday, which started with a fire at the Nkoantoma Military Base in the coastal city of Bata, according to the defence ministry.
Citing Vice President Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the health ministry put the death toll at 98, more than triple an earlier estimate of 31 killed.
Of the wounded, 299 remained hospitalised, the ministry wrote on Twitter. 
President Teodoro Obiang Nguema, the vice president's father, has attributed the accident to negligence related to the handling of dynamite and said the explosions damaged almost all homes and buildings in Bata, a city of just over 250,000 people.
Equatorial Guinea's health ministry posted on Twitter that it had prepared a mental health brigade made up of psychiatrists, psychologists and nurses to attend to the victims of the blast. 
""The damages are not only physical but also mental,"" the ministry said.

Ardern was asked by a reporter if the interview, and the picture painted of the royal family, had given her pause around New Zealand's constitutional ties with the royals.
""I’ve said before that, you know, I’ve not sensed an appetite from New Zealanders for significant change in our constitutional arrangements, and I don’t expect that

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Around 1,000 women gathered near Istanbul's main Taksim Square on Monday, protesting what they see as a lack of action by authorities to prevent and punish violence against women, in a country where femicide rates have surged in recent years.
The protesters, mostly women carrying purple flags with women and LGBTI+ signs and wearing purple masks reading ""We will win our freedom,"" gathered on a main street after police closed off the entrances to Taksim Square on International Women's Day.
Women police stood with their arms linked at the end of the street, blocking entry to the square while behind them stood fences, police in riot gear and water cannon trucks.
""Women are very strong and they are afraid of this. They should block murderers, not us,"" said Ipek Deniz, a 36-year-old nurse participating in the protests.
The femicide rate roughly doubled between 2011 and 2019, according to a group that monitors murders of women, which also said that so far in 2021, 51 women have been murdered and another 26 have died under suspicious circumstances. 
Turkey does not keep official statistics on femicide.
At the weekend, a video showing a woman being punched and kicked in the head by her ex-husband on the street in northern Turkey sparked outrage on social media. The suspect was then detained, media reports said, while the woman was admitted to hospital.
Speaking at a congress of his AK Party's women's wing, President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would establish a commission in parliament to address issues regarding violence against women.
""We hear that there are those who call on girls to leave their father's homes as soon as possible. Turkey will somehow solve the problem of violence against women, the real threat is this mentality taking root,"" he said.
The protester around Taksim chanted ""Femicide is political"" and ""The life is ours, the choice is ours, the streets are ours, you can keep your family.""
""We are oppressed under the male power every day. Women's murderers are rewarded by not being punished,"" said Sumeyye Kose, a 21-year-old student.

""We are here against increasing violence, against systematic LGBTI-phobia, against femicide. We will win,"" she said.

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - The trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the death of George Floyd was delayed until at least Tuesday morning as the judge contended with a last-minute order by a higher court to reconsider adding an additional murder charge.
The trial had been scheduled to begin on Monday with the screening of jurors to weigh murder and manslaughter charges in a case seen as a referendum on police violence against Black Americans. Chauvin appeared in court dressed in a navy blue suit and tie, a white shirt and a black face mask, jotting notes in a yellow legal pad on the table before him.
Judge Peter Cahill of the Hennepin County district court set aside three weeks for jury selection alone, mindful of the difficulties finding impartial Minneapolitans in a case that has convulsed a nation and in which an image of the victim — a selfie of Floyd faintly smiling — has become an international icon of racial justice.
But that was delayed at the urging of prosecutors after the Minnesota Court of Appeals told Cahill in an order issued on Friday he must reconsider prosecutors' request to also reinstate a third charge, third-degree murder, over the defendant's objections. 
Eric Nelson, Chauvin's lead lawyer, told the court on Monday morning that Chauvin would soon ask the Minnesota Supreme Court to overturn Friday's order, a process that could take weeks, although he saw no reason for that to delay jury selection.
But prosecutors from the Minnesota attorney general's office urged the court to delay jury selection until the appeal was resolved.
""We're not doing this to interfere, to slow this down, but it is a very important matter,"" Matthew Frank, an assistant attorney general, told the court. Prosecutors feared picking a jury when the number of charges was still unresolved could make it easier for Chauvin to appeal a verdict later, Frank said.
Cahill declined, repeatedly saying he believed he was entitled to at least begin seating jurors unless a higher court ordered him not to. Prosecutors then said they would ask the Appeals Court to intervene to delay the trial. Cahill suspended jury selection until at least Tuesday.
Chauvin, 44, is charged with second-degree murder, which carries a sentence of up to 40 years in prison, and manslaughter. 
He was released from jail on a $1 million bond last October and will be tried in a courtroom in the Hennepin County Government Center, a tower in downtown Minneapolis now ringed with fencing and concrete barricades for fear of disruption by protesters.
Hundreds of anti-racism protesters chanted in the streets around the courthouse, blocking traffic. They scattered flowers on the tarmac, along with mirrors smeared with fake blood and daubed with slogans asking passers-by to ""reflect"" on Floyd's death. A few volunteers set up tables, handing out donated coffee and donuts. A small number of soldiers called in from the Minnesota National Guard watched from a distance.
The courtroom has been adapted to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus, and Cahill has sharply limited attendance inside: the families of Chauvin and Floyd have each been allocated a single seat inside the courtroom. 
Bridgett Floyd, George Floyd's sister and founder of the George Floyd Memorial Foundation, went inside for the first day. No one took the seat reserved for Chauvin's family, according to a pool reporter inside the courtroom.
Most reporters attending must watch a video stream in a building across the street. 
Lawyers for Chauvin, who was fired from the police force the day after Floyd's death, have argued that he correctly followed his training in helping colleagues arrest Floyd on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at the Cup Foods grocery store. A handcuffed Floyd can be seen in videos struggling against being placed in a police vehicle complaining he has claustrophobia. 

The medical examiner ruled that Floyd's death was a homicide caused partly by police restraint holds. But the autopsy report also noted that Floyd had recently ingested the opioid fentanyl, and Chauvin's lawyers contend that an overdose was the main cause of death.

The lead-coated spire, which for more than 150 years had defined the central Paris sky line, was consumed by the blaze in April 2019, collapsing through the stone vaulted roof to the tears and gasps of distraught onlookers.
President Emmanuel Macron announced last summer that the 96-metre (315 ft) spire would be reconstructed as originally designed by Eugene Viollet-le-Duc in the 19th century, launching the hunt for the 1,000 oaks required to build the spire and the frame of the cathedral's transept.
""It's exceptional,"" Aymeric Albert, the forestry commission's commercial director, said of the sawn trunk of one-rod-straight 200-year-old oak. ""It's perfectly straight and without any internal defects.""
The trunk was large enough for an 18-metre long beam that will help support the weight of the spire, he said.
The trees that will be taken from the Domaine de Berce, near Le Mans, were identified at the beginning of the year and must all be chopped down before the end of March before the sap rises and the wood contains too much moisture.
The trunks, each of which are worth about 15,000 euros ($17,800), will be laid to dry for 12 to 18 months before being cut into shape.
The cathedral's original roof contained so many oak beams it was called ""la foret"" (the forest).
Albert said the selected trunks were the ""perfect result"" from two centuries of skilled work in a forest that previously supplied timber to the French navy.
""Now we'll leave room for a new generation of oaks which in 200 years will create the same forest we see today,"" he said.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has started enriching uranium with a third set of advanced IR-2m centrifuges at its underground plant at Natanz, the U.N. nuclear watchdog told its member states on Monday, a further breach of Tehran's 2015 deal with major powers.
The move is part of a recent acceleration by Iran of its violations of restrictions under that deal, which granted Iran relief from financial sanctions in return for curbs to its nuclear activities.
It began breaching limits after then-U.S. President Donald Trump quit the deal and re-imposed sanctions in 2018.
The acceleration of breaches appears aimed at raising pressure on Trump's successor Joe Biden. The new U.S. president wants to revive the accord, but Washington and Tehran are locked in a standoff over which side should move first.
The deal allows Iran to enrich uranium only with first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at the underground, commercial scale Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP) at Natanz. In November Iran started enriching there with a first set of IR-2m machines, which are far more efficient, and has since been adding to it.
""On 7 March 2021, the Agency verified at FEP that: Iran had begun feeding natural UF6 into the third cascade of 174 IR-2m centrifuges,"" the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a report obtained by Reuters, referring to uranium hexafluoride, the form in which uranium is fed into centrifuges to purify it.
""The fourth cascade of 174 IR-2m centrifuges was installed but had yet to be fed with natural UF6; installation of a fifth cascade of IR-2m centrifuges was ongoing; and installation of a sixth cascade of IR-2m centrifuges had yet to begin,"" it added.

In addition to its IR-1 machines, Iran is now using 522 IR-2m centrifuges to enrich uranium to up to 5% fissile purity at the FEP, the IAEA added. That is more than the 3.67% purity allowed under the deal but less than the 20% it is enriching to at another facility, Fordow. Uranium enriched to 90% purity can be used to make an atomic weapon.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Holding signs such as ""Respect my existence or expect my resistance,"" thousands of women on Monday protested across Spain against gender violence and in support of equal rights at International Women's Day rallies. 
The largest protest was in Barcelona where several thousand assembled in the city centre, mostly women wearing purple clothes and with banners saying: ""It will be a happy day when none of us is missing."" 
The protest was authorized but attendance was capped at 3,500 people, who had to maintain social distance due to the pandemic. 
In Madrid, authorities banned Women's Day marches after criticism that last year's rallies helped spread the coronavirus.
But defying the ban, around 50 women protested at the city's famous Puerta del Sol square, with some carrying placards that read: ""Male violence is also a pandemic.""
Police stood by as protesters walked around the square and lit a purple smoke flare.
""We are here to claim the right of women to demonstrate ... It's outrageous that the self-proclaimed most feminist government in history is banning women's marches on March 8,"" said Josefina Martinez, 42, spokeswoman of a feminist association.

A group of women also staged a protest after vandals defaced a mural portraying famous women such as U.S. civil rights activist Rosa Parks and Mexican artist Frida Kahlo on the outskirts of Madrid.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poles took to the streets on Monday to mark International Women's Day, in demonstrations around the country that took on added significance months after a constitutional court banned almost all abortions.
The October ruling, which took effect in January, unleashed a wave of protests that has morphed into broader anger at the government, particularly among young people. Recent protests have been much smaller, but the ruling party's ratings in most opinion polls have slipped to around 30% from more than 40% in August.
In Warsaw, several dozen protesters brandishing placards with slogans such as ""I am a feminist warrior"" gathered in the city centre, where they were outnumbered by a heavy police presence.
Previous protests organised by the Women's Strike movement, which opposes the tightening of restrictions regarding abortion, have been marred by violence, with the police criticised for heavy-handed tactics.
""It is difficult to say anything positive about Women's Day today. We are at war and all I can hope for is that we will win the war,"" Klementyna Suchanow, co-founder of the Women's Strike told Reuters before the demonstration began.
""Women's Day in 2021 has a specific flavour,"" she said. ""After the abortion regulations were tightened, this holiday takes on the significance of a battle, just like in the beginning when it was first established, over a 100 years ago.""
As police formed a cordon around the protestors, speech therapist Aleksandra Gajek, 24, called it an intimidation tactic. ""The number of police is intended to scare us and force us to stop fighting for our rights,"" she told Reuters.

The police was trying to keep traffic moving, spokesman Sylwester Marczak said by phone. ""The actions of the police are determined by the blocking of traffic on one of the most important roundabouts in Warsaw.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - China urged the United States on Sunday to remove ""unreasonable"" curbs on cooperation as soon as possible and work together on issues like climate change, while accusing Washington of bringing chaos in the name of spreading democracy.
Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden singled out a ""growing rivalry with China"" as a key challenge facing the United States, with his top diplomat describing the country as ""the biggest geopolitical test"" of this century.
Speaking at his annual news conference, the Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, struck a tough line even as he outlined where the world's two biggest economies could work together.
Questioned about U.S.-China frictions over Taiwan, Xinjiang and the disputed South China Sea, Wang said Beijing ""will never accept baseless accusations and smears"". 
The United States had used democracy and human rights as a basis for arbitrarily interfering with other countries' affairs, he said. ""The U.S. should realise this as soon as possible, otherwise the world will continue to experience instability.""
The White House brushed aside the criticisms over Taiwan and said Washington would continue to support Taipei.
Wang said differences between Beijing and Washington must be managed carefully, the two sides must advocate healthy competition not zero-sum finger-pointing, and that areas like climate change and fighting the pandemic were where they could cooperate.
""It is hoped that the United States and China will meet each other halfway and lift the various unreasonable restrictions placed on Sino-U.S. cooperation to date as soon as possible, and not create new obstacles artificially.""
The United States and China are at odds over influence in the Indo-Pacific region, Beijing's economic practices, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights in China's Xinjiang region. 
The Biden administration has indicated it will broadly continue the tough approach to China taken by former President Donald Trump, but do so in coordination with allies. 
Wang warned there was no room for compromise on Chinese-claimed Taiwan and the new U.S. government should drop the previous administration's ""dangerous acts of playing with fire"". 
Biden's team called the U.S. commitment to democratic Taiwan ""rock solid"" and on Monday White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told a regular news briefing Washington would ""continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defence capability.""
""Our position on Taiwan remains clear. We will stand with friends and allies to advance our shared prosperity, security and values in the Indo-Pacific region,"" she said when asked about Wang's remarks.
Under Trump, the United States imposed sanctions against China and its officials over Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Beijing's economic policies, which have not been lifted by Biden.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said he agrees with his predecessor Mike Pompeo's determination that genocide against Muslims is under way in Xinjiang.
Activists and U.N. experts say 1 million Muslim Uighurs are held in Chinese camps. China denies abuses and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.
Wang said some Western politicians chose to believe lies about Xinjiang, and took a dig at Western countries' records.
""When it comes to 'genocide', most people think of North American Indians in the 16th century, African slaves in the 19th century, Jews in the 20th century, and the Australian aborigines who are still fighting today,"" he said.

""The so-called 'genocide' in Xinjiang is ridiculously absurd. It is a rumour with ulterior motives and a complete lie.""

Exceptions will be made to ensure national elections on March 15-17 proceed as planned.
""It would not be prudent now to announce any easing,"" Rutte said, adding that some adjustments might be possible around the Easter vacation and gradually as vaccination levels increase through the summer.
Coronavirus infections in the Netherlands have stabilized in the past week, following a modest rise in February attributed by health authorities in part to new variants of the virus becoming more prevalent.
The 9 p.m.-4.30 a.m. curfew sparked several days of rioting throughout the country when it was first imposed six weeks ago.
Restaurants and bars might be allowed to start serving customers on outdoor terraces by next month if the infection rate drops in the coming three weeks, Rutte said.
Public gatherings remained banned, private visits are limited to one person at a time. Government advice against unnecessary international travel will remain in place until at least April 15, Rutte said.
Bars and restaurants in the Netherlands have been closed since mid-October, along with other public places such as museums, libraries, gyms and cinemas.
Last month the government allowed non-essential stores and hairdressers to reopen for a limited amount of customers by appointment.
Shopkeepers, restaurant owners and anti-lockdown activists have launched several court cases to get relief from lockdown measures in recent weeks, but without success so far.

Polls indicate that Rutte's conservative VVD party will remain the largest at the elections, even though public support for his coronavirus policies has declined in recent weeks.

Earlier in the day, the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh said Washington was committed to defending Saudi following Sunday's volley of drones and missiles, including one aimed at a Saudi facility vital to oil exports. 
""We continue to be alarmed by the frequency of Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia. Escalating attacks like these are not the actions of a group that is serious about peace,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.
""We understand that they face genuine security threats from Yemen and others in the region...We will look for ways to improve support for Saudi Arabia's ability to defend its territory against threats,"" she told a Washington news briefing.
Saudi-led coalition authorities said most of Sunday's drones and missiles were intercepted en route to their targets and there were no casualties or property losses from the attacks.
They targeted an oil storage yard at Ras Tanura, site of a refinery and the world's biggest offshore oil-loading facility, and a residential compound in Dhahran used by state-controlled oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222). [L1N2L502H] 
The attacks, which drove Brent crude prices above $70 a barrel to their highest since January 2020, come at a time of friction in the decades-old alliance between Saudi Arabia and the United States as President Joe Biden puts pressure on Riyadh over its human rights record and the ruinous Yemen war.
""The United States stands by Saudi Arabia and its people. Our commitment to defend the kingdom and its security is firm,""
the U.S. Embassy said in an Arabic-language Twitter post.
The Houthis have been battling a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen for six years in a conflict largely regarded as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
In new incidents on Monday, the coalition said it had intercepted and destroyed a ballistic missile and an explosive drone fired towards parts of the kingdom's southern region. 
The Houthi military claimed to have hit a military target at Saudi Arabia's Abha airport, near the Yemen border, with a new type of ballistic missile. 
ACCUSATIONS
Saudi Defence Ministry spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki, who also speaks for the coalition, said on Al Arabiya TV that Iran was smuggling missiles and drones to the Houthis. The Houthis and Tehran have in the past rejected such charges. [D5N2JU016]
Riyadh has repeatedly said that Iran's ballistic missile programme and support for regional proxies including in Yemen should be part of any talks aimed at reviving a 2015 nuclear pact with Iran that Biden's predecessor Donald Trump quit.
The Houthi movement said its operation on Sunday using 14 drones and eight ballistic missiles also attacked military targets in the Saudi cities of Dammam, Asir and Jazan.
The coalition said it destroyed 12 Houthi drones, without specifying locations in the kingdom, and two ballistic missiles launched towards Jazan.
The Saudi Defence Ministry later said it had intercepted an armed drone coming from the sea before it could hit its target at Ras Tanura. Shrapnel from a ballistic missile fell near the residential compound used by Aramco.
The two sites in Eastern Province are located on the Gulf coast across from Iran and near Iraq and Bahrain, which is the regional base of the U.S. Navy. Yemen lies nearly 1,000 km (600 miles) southwest on the Gulf of Aden.
Eastern Province has most of Aramco's production and export facilities. In 2019, Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, was shaken by a big attack on oil installations just a few km (miles) from the facilities targeted on Sunday, which Riyadh blamed on Iran, an accusation Tehran denies.
The 2019 attack, which was claimed by the Houthis but which Riyadh said did not originate from Yemen, forced Saudi Arabia to temporarily shut more than half of its crude output. 
The United States later sent American troops and military equipment to bolster the kingdom's air and missile defences.
The Houthis have stepped up attacks as the United States and United Nations have been pushing for a ceasefire to revive stalled Yemen peace talks. Biden has declared a halt to U.S. support for coalition offensive operations in Yemen but said Washington would continue to help Saudi Arabia defend itself. 

On Sunday, the Saudi-led coalition said the Houthis were emboldened after the Biden administration revoked terrorist designations on the group imposed by Trump.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brussels' public transport operator marked International Women's Day on Monday by renaming 10 metro stations after famous women for one day, and pledging to permanently rename 17 bus and tram stops over the next three years to ""feminise"" its network.
The late U.S. civil rights leader Rosa Parks, girls' rights champion Malala Yousafzai and teen climate-change fighter Greta Thunberg were among those whose names were given for a day to stops on the Belgian capital's four-line subway network.
Transport operator STIB said in a statement that permanently renaming long-established stations and stops throws up practical challenges, but it was committed to bringing more balance to its network over time.
STIB said that many public transport stops are named after men whose names are given to streets in those neighbourhoods, and there are 14 times more streets named after men than women in Brussels.
""At the time the names were chosen, society was different. Women did not have a role in society then, unlike today,"" it said. ""It was men who took the decisions and obviously they chose"" men's names.
Seven bus and tram stations will be renamed after women this year, and 10 more in 2022 and 2023, but changes to metro station names will need approval from the regional transport ministry.

The 15-page report, compiled by a group headed by retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Russel Honoré, also recommended an upgrade to U.S. Capitol Police intelligence capabilities. The report was requested by House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the aftermath of the rampage by a mob of former President Donald Trump's supporters that left five people dead including a police officer.
The report was broadly critical of the U.S. Capitol Police department's preparedness in the run-up to the attack.
""The USCP were understaffed, insufficiently equipped and inadequately trained to secure the Capitol and members"" of Congress, the report stated.
One recommendation called for eventually replacing the fencing erected around the Capitol after the attack with a ""mobile fencing"" option. 
Other recommendations included beefed-up intelligence operations and training within Capitol Police, and the creation of a new ""quick-reaction force"" covering the entire city of Washington under the command of the District of Columbia National Guard and using military police from across the United States on temporary rotations.

“In the atmosphere of love and tolerance promoted by the visit of His Holiness the Pope to the land of Iraq, we present today the call for a national dialogue,” Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi said in a televised speech.
Many in Iraq hope the Papal visit will garner more international support for Kadhimi's government to handle sensitive crises, including reining in Iran-backed militias whose power and influence Kadhimi has sought to curb since taking office in May 2020.
The prime minister said dialogue would help to reduce tension in his country and pave the way for a successful early election. 
Controlling armed groups which operate out of state control is still an significant challenge for the prime minister. 
Pope Francis ended his tour, the first ever papal visit to Iraq, on Monday after visiting conflict-torn cities, meeting Muslim and Christian leaders and preaching peace and coexistence over war. The visit had started on Friday.

The pontiff also made a rare first event in meeting Iraq’s Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq’s top Shi’ite Muslim cleric who is one of the most important figures in Shi’ite Islam, both within Iraq and beyond.

""She's completely unambiguous on it and it's been lovely to have that, you know, joy on the other side of the phone,"" her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, told Reuters.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe served a five year sentence which ended on Sunday. An ankle bracelet was removed, allowing her freedom to travel in Iran, but she still cannot leave the country, as she has been ordered to appear for a new court case on March 14 on charges of propaganda against the Iranian state. [L1N2L5085]
Despite the ambiguity about her future, her husband said she saw had a ""big grin"" during a video call. ""It's clearly a good step that they took the ankle tag off, they observed Iranian law,"" he said.
The new court case ""is a bit ambiguous at the moment but it's there,"" he said. ""In truth until we get to Sunday we won't really know what it means or where we are.""
He spoke outside the Iranian embassy in London, where he and the couple's six-year-old daughter, Gabriella, tried and failed to deliver a petition calling for her to be allowed to return home.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation charity, was arrested at a Tehran airport in April 2016 and convicted of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. 
She served out most of her sentence in Tehran's Evin prison, but was moved to her parents' house under house arrest last March because of concern about the coronavirus.

Iran's judiciary was not immediately available to comment about her release. Her family and the foundation, a charity that operates independently of media firm Thomson Reuters and its news subsidiary Reuters, deny the charge.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 12:10PM ET</span>",Leader of Indian state promises food and shelter for families fleeing Myanmar,"By Devjyot Ghoshal
AIZAWL, India (Reuters) - The chief minister of a small Indian state into which a stream of refugees from Myanmar have entered in recent days said on Monday that they should be given temporary shelter, as the federal government decides on whether some will be sent back.
Several low-ranking Myanmar police and their families have crossed into northeastern Mizoram state, where they have sought refuge to avoid taking orders from a junta that imposed a coup in the Southeast Asian country last month.
But authorities in Myanmar last week asked officials in Mizoram to detain and return eight police officers, raising concerns about their safety if they are sent back by India.
""As common sense dictates, when there is a political problem in one country and when there is a fear for one's life, if they cross over to the neighbouring countries, then normally they were not sent back,"" Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga said in an interview.
The final call would be taken by the federal government, which has been communicating with Mizoram authorities and still hasn't given clear directions, creating some confusion on how the refugees would be handled, he said.
""From the humanitarian point of view, we have to give them food, we have to give them shelter,"" said Zoramthanga, who uses only one name.
Myanmar and Mizoram share a 404-km (250-mile) border, with only a shallow river currently dividing the two countries in some parts, making it easy for people to cross.
Although the porous nature of the frontier made it difficult to estimate exactly how many from Myanmar had walked into Mizoram in recent weeks, Zoramthanga said it could be between 20 and 30.
But a senior police official in Mizoram's capital said nearly 100 people from Myanmar, mostly police and their families, had crossed over in five border districts.
Some of the defected Myanmar police have told Indian officials they fled after being ordered to use violence against protesters, who have staged weeks of demonstrations against the coup that deposed the civilian government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
More than 50 people have been killed by security forces, according the United Nations, with some 1,700 people detained, including Suu Kyi.
The situation has put India in a potential diplomatic bind, given New Delhi's close relations with the Myanmar military, which it works with on counter-insurgency operations in the northeastern region.
Zoramthanga, a 76-year-old rebel leader turned politician, said that tribes in Mizoram had deep cultural links with those on the Myanmar side, but the major concern was risk to lives that was forcing them to cross over.
""We have to have sympathy for them,"" he said.

""The pandemic is not yet over, but with the acceleration of the vaccine plan, a way out is not far off,"" Draghi said in a speech to mark international women's day, his first such public address since taking office last month.
Italy is poised to become the seventh country in the world to register more than 100,000 COVID-related deaths and health officials have warned that the country faces a third wave of cases as a more contagious variant of the disease gains ground.
""We are all facing a new worsening of the health emergency these days,"" Draghi said.
""Our task, and I am referring to all the institutions, is to safeguard the lives of Italians by all means possible and to allow a return to normality as soon as possible. Every life counts,"" he added.
Since taking charge of the country at the head of a broad government of national unity, Draghi has looked to speed up vaccinations and has put pressure on pharmaceutical companies to honour their contracts and make up supply shortfalls.
Italy, which has a population of around 60 million, had administered 5.41 doses of vaccines as of early Monday, with 1.65 million people receiving the recommended two shots.

Draghi has suggested that first jabs should take precedence rather than stockpiling supplies for eventual second doses.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday sidestepped a chance to review the scope of a legal defense called qualified immunity that increasingly has been used to shield police accused of excessive force, turning away an appeal by a Cleveland man who sued after being roughed up by police while trying to enter his own home. 
The justices declined to hear the appeal by Shase Howse, who said he was slammed to the ground outside the house where he lived with his mother in a poor and mostly Black neighborhood, struck in the back of the neck and jailed after police deemed his actions suspicious. Howse, who was 20 at the time, is Black. The police involved in the 2016 incident are white.
Qualified immunity protects police officers and other types of government officials from civil litigation in certain circumstances, allowing lawsuits only when an individual's ""clearly established"" statutory or constitutional rights have been violated.
Police use of force has been closely scrutinized following the May 2020 death of a Black man named George Floyd after a Minneapolis officer knelt on his neck. 
The U.S. House of Representatives last Wednesday passed policing reform legislation that among other provisions would eliminate the qualified immunity defense for law enforcement. The legislation, supported by most Democrats and opposed by Republicans, faces an uphill battle in the Senate.
Howse's case was featured in a Reuters investigation into qualified immunity published in December. The investigation illustrated how the endorsement of this defense by courts has denied Black Americans recourse to justice under a law enacted 150 years ago specifically to protect them from abuses by state and local authorities in the post-Civil War years. 
Howse sued two police officers, Brian Middaugh and Thomas Hodous, accusing them of excessive force in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. The officers said they used only the force necessary to subdue Howse. 
The Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020 granted the officers qualified immunity, ruling that no ""clearly established"" precedent showed that their actions were unlawful. 
In May 2020, a Reuters investigation revealed how qualified immunity, under the careful stewardship of the Supreme Court, has made it easier for police to kill or injure civilians with impunity by shielding them from lawsuits, even when courts determine police actually violated a person's constitutional rights. 
Law enforcement professionals and some U.S. conservatives have argued that qualified immunity is essential for police to make quick decisions in dangerous situations without fear of lawsuits. 

In recent months, the Supreme Court has signaled a potential softening of its approach to qualified immunity. In two cases the justices allowed inmates to sue prison guards who had been granted immunity by lower courts from accusations that they violated the Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday will order a review of changes the previous administration made to on rules on how colleges should handle sexual assault allegations and formally establish a White House Gender Policy Council, officials said. 
A Biden executive order he will sign later on Monday will direct the U.S. Education Department to review all its existing regulations, orders, guidance, and ""policies for consistency with the administration’s policy to guarantee education free from sexual violence,"" according to a White House fact sheet provided Sunday night. 
In 2017, the Trump administration reversed Obama-era guidelines that had spelled out measures schools should follow to try to prevent sexual assaults on campuses. Trump's Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, argued the Obama guidelines resulted in too many students being falsely charged and the accused being treated unfairly.
In May 2020, DeVos unveiled final regulations on how colleges should deal with sexual misconduct allegations on campuses. She said the rules would require ""schools to act in meaningful ways to support survivors of sexual misconduct, without sacrificing important safeguards to ensure a fair and transparent process.""
Biden's order directs a review of the 2020 regulation ""to determine whether the regulation and agency action are consistent with the policies of the Biden-Harris Administration,"" the fact sheet said. 
A second executive order will formally establish a White House council gender equality council, officials said. 
The council is part of ""a government-wide focus on uplifting the rights of women and girls in the United States and around the world,"" according to a White House fact sheet.
Jennifer Klein, chief strategy and policy officer at anti-sexual harassment activist group Time's Up, is cochairing the council with Julissa Reynoso, a lawyer who previously served as a diplomat and deputy assistant secretary of state during the Obama administration.
As a candidate, Biden pledged to narrow the wage gap between men and women, invest in women-owned businesses and fight against work-place discrimination. His vice president, Kamala Harris, is the first woman to occupy the position.
The council will work with other parts of the administration to address ""barriers to women’s participation in the labor force, decreasing wage and wealth gaps, and addressing the caregiving needs of American families and supporting care workers,"" the fact sheet said. 
As of January, women accounted for slightly more than half of the 10 million jobs lost during the coronavirus crisis, even though they typically make up a little less than half the work force.
More than 2.5 million women left the labor force between February 2020 and January of this year, compared to 1.8 million men.

Biden will direct the council to submit a ""government-wide strategy to address gender in policies, programs and budgets"" and an annual report on progress, the White House said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada on Monday took a step to ensure that its upcoming spring budget, which will also outline a promised post-pandemic stimulus package, includes measures to get women working and address gender inequality.
The finance department set up the Task Force on Women in the Economy to advise the government on actions to address gender imbalances exacerbated by COVID-19, a statement said. It will be co-chaired by Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland.
""Canada's future prosperity and competitiveness depend on the ability of women to participate equally – and fully – in our workforce,"" Freeland said in a statement. 
Since being named finance minister in August, Freeland has repeatedly spoken about having a ""feminist agenda,"" and has promised a national childcare plan will be part of a stimulus package worth up to C$100 billion ($79 billion) over three years.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the stimulus - to be detailed in the spring budget - is needed to jump-start Canada's post-pandemic recovery.
""This crisis has created a she-cession and has threatened to roll back the hard-fought social and economic progress of all women,"" Trudeau said in a statement in honor of International Women's Day. 
""To build a fairer and more equal Canada, we must ensure a feminist, intersectional recovery from this crisis."" 
Canadian women are more likely than men to have lost jobs in the pandemic, and three times more women than men have left the labor force entirely since February 2020. Mothers, racialized women and young women have all been disproportionately affected. 
""There is definitely plenty of runway to help shape the budget,"" a government source said of the panel, which is made up of a diverse group of women from across Canada, including politicians, academics, social advocates, economists and business leaders.

1013,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 09:51AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why protests are shaking one of Africa's most stable democracies,"By Edward McAllister
DAKAR (Reuters) - Clashes between police and thousands of demonstrators protesting at the detention of Senegal's most prominent opposition leader have killed at least five people since last week.
Ousmane Sonko was indicted and released on bail under judicial supervision on Monday but an opposition coalition has called for three days of protests from Monday. 
The unrest is the worst in a decade in Senegal, widely seen as one of West Africa's most stable democracies. 
Following is a look at what is driving the unrest.
ACCUSATIONS OF POLITICAL INTERFERENCE
The demonstrations were ignited by Sonko's arrest last week, after an employee of a beauty salon accused him of raping her. Sonko denies the allegation.
Many protesters see Sonko's arrest as an attempt by Sall to torpedo the career of a prominent rival, not as a legitimate reaction to a credible rape charge. 
Sall has been accused of targeting other political rivals in recent years, prompting accusations of political interference.
The charismatic former mayor of Dakar, Khalifa Sall (no relation to the president), was sentenced to five years in jail in 2018 for embezzlement, ruling him out of the 2019 presidential race. The president pardoned Sall after the election, raising suspicions that the charges were deliberately timed for the vote. 
Karim Wade, the son of former president Abdoulaye Wade and a presidential hopeful himself, was jailed in 2015 for corruption, ending his political ambitions. He was also subsequently pardoned and now lives in Qatar. 
COVID-19 AND THE ECONOMY
Sonko's arrest has served as a lightning rod for other frustrations. Many Senegalese resent what they see as the corruption, injustice and economic imbalance caused by rapid modernisation.
The West African economy is expected to be transformed this decade by new oil and gas production. Major construction projects, including a new city outside the capital Dakar, are attracting global investment and enriching a small elite. Most Senegalese see little benefit. 
Allegations of corruption surrounding the award of a petroleum license to a company run by the president's brother triggered street protests in 2016. Many Senegalese see international corporations as the only winners. 
The arrival of COVID-19 in 2020 widened the gap between rich and poor. Restrictions on gatherings and a nightly curfew have done little to stem infections, critics say, but they have strangled the informal economy that provides cash-in-hand wages to millions of people. The curfew provoked clashes between the youth and police last year.
A second wave of infections this year has prolonged restrictions and threatens to derail an economic rebound. 
THIRD TERM FEARS
Macky Sall was swept to power in 2012 on a wave of popular support. His predecessor Abdoulaye Wade's third-term bid triggered mass protests and Sall's election win was seen as a victory for regional democracy. 
Now, many protesters worry that Sall will use a change in the constitution in 2016 to extend his rule into a third term. 
Leaders in Guinea and Ivory Coast have used constitutional changes to act as a reset button on their rule, allowing them to run again. 

Sall, 59, has not ruled out this option, stoking fears - and anger - that he might jeopardise Senegal's once bright democratic future.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Senegal opposition leader Ousmane Sonko was indicted and released on bail under judicial supervision on Monday, his lawyer said, as he faces a rape accusation that has sparked violent protests.
Sonko's release could help ease tensions that have buffeted one of West Africa's most stable democracies in the past week, leaving at least eight dead in clashes between protesters and police, right group Amnesty International said on Monday.
""He (Sonko) has been indicted for rape and death threats and placed under judicial supervision. He is going home,"" Sonko's lawyer, Cheikh Koureyssi Ba, told Reuters. 
Several hundred people gathered outside the courthouse waving flags and chanting ""Free Sonko"" on Monday morning before beginning to march. His supporters have called for three days of nationwide protests this week.
Much of Senegal's capital Dakar was at a standstill in anticipation of further unrest, and army tanks patrolled downtown streets.
Sonko, who finished third in the 2019 presidential election, was arrested after an employee of a beauty salon accused him of raping her. He denies the allegation and says it is an attempt by President Macky Sall to kneecap a political rival. 
The government denies this. 
Kindled by Sonko's arrest, the protests have grown into the worst political unrest the country has seen in years as youth vent frustrations about unemployment, inequality and corruption. 
Political pressure has risen on President Macky Sall, whose tenure has been plagued by accusations that he unjustly torpedoes political rivals and worries that he may seek to extend his rule beyond his allotted two-term limit.
""This is not only about Sonko. We want Macky to resign,"" yelled one man marching in a crowd of people on Monday. 

Many are suspicious of the accusations against Sonko because two other prominent rivals of Sall were previously targeted by criminal charges that prevented them from running for president in 2019.

DUNEDIN, Florida/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - From the crack of the baseball bat in Florida to clinking of cocktails in San Francisco bars, the sounds of spring are in the air as Americans start to return to many of the beloved pastimes they were forced to abandon 12 months ago.
With cities and states loosening restrictions as new COVID-19 cases recede and the rollout of vaccines accelerates, people are enjoying a taste of their old lives again.
Over the past weekend, New Yorkers watched movies on the big screen, San Franciscans dined indoors, and baseball fans cheered on their favorite big-league players as spring training resumed in Florida. 
""It feels awesome,"" said civil engineering specialist Matt Skelton, 39, leaving a concession stand on Saturday afternoon clutching a bag of popcorn at TD Ballpark in Florida's West Coast city of Dunedin, seasonal home of the Toronto Blue Jays. 
""You can feel how it's not as tense or stressed. People are feeling a sense of relief,"" added Skelton, muffled by his mask. 
He isn't the only one feeling upbeat.
In just one month, the mood in the United States has rebounded from an eight-year low to the highest level recorded by Reuters/Ipsos polls that date back to 2012. 
In January, just 15% of Americans thought the country was headed in the right direction, according to a poll taken after the deadly attack on the Capitol by supporters of former president Donald Trump. The latest poll, conducted Feb. 18-24, shows that since then the percentage who think the country is headed in the right direction has nearly tripled, to 42%. 
In North Carolina, college students whose university experience was rocked by the pandemic drew solace from watching a basketball game between UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke University men's teams, only the second game this season with spectators.
""Everyone was saying we would rather come to this than graduation,"" UNC-Chapel Hill college senior Charlotte Wirtz said on Saturday night. ""It doesn't make up for losing a whole year. But this would be the one thing we'd be the most upset about missing.""
To be sure, the pandemic, which has killed more than half a million Americans, is far from over. In fact, some health experts are warning that a decline in new cases is leveling off and potentially more virulent variants are spreading just as restrictions ease. 
Even as the U.S. government distributed more than 110 million vaccine doses and put shots into over 57 million arms, according to federal data, the country is still recording upwards of 60,000 new COVID-19 cases daily.
Against that backdrop, President Joe Biden said decisions by the Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi last week to order complete rollbacks of their mask mandates and other COVID-19 mitigation measures amounted to ""Neanderthal thinking.""
While his administration is urging vigilance, its tone is decidedly optimistic. Last week the president said the United States will have enough vaccine to inoculate all adults by May, months ahead of his earlier forecast. 
NIGHTS OUT AGAIN
To get a read on the mood of the country, Reuters reporters fanned out this weekend to talk to Americans as they began to enjoy some of life's simple pleasures again. 
In San Francisco, where the city allowed indoor dining for the first time in months, patrons quickly found their way back under the colorful lights of the Beaux bar in the Castro neighborhood, a center of gay culture.
""The dream is real,"" software engineer Brian Kennedy, 36, said as he nursed a bourbon by the bar on Friday night. ""It feels relaxing and slightly normalizing.""
At tables around him, old friends huddled to catch up and compare notes on their vaccination experiences, while couples debated what restaurants they wanted to visit next.
""I hope to go out tomorrow night for dinner,"" said hairdresser Michael Hollis, 68, as he caught up with friends of 50 years. ""I go out whenever I can. After the second shot, I just feel safer.""
Of course, it was not entirely business as usual.
San Francisco restaurants remain restricted to 25% capacity inside, waiters hurry around behind masks, tables are spaced well apart and dance floors are still off-limits. 
In Chicago, freelance worker Knyckolas Davis was relieved to be able to celebrate his 35th birthday out at Rizzo's Bar & Inn, across the street from Wrigley Field ballpark, but he could not help longing for full normality.
""I still cannot wait for everyone to be in a room, smiling, happy and not worrying about anything else but being in the moment,"" said Davis, as dance music blared in the background and college basketball games aired on flat-screen televisions.
Chicago bars and restaurants remain restricted to 50% capacity and must close by 1 a.m.
In New York City, cinemas re-opened on Friday after nearly a year, giving the city's legion of film fans a chance to catch a movie from somewhere besides their living room couch.
Movie houses opened to 25% capacity, with no more than 50 people per screen, following state guidelines. Tickets quickly sold out at many venues.
For film student Noah Nemeroff, 22, just seeing a big screen again was a sign of hope. 

""It's like a reminder that things are going to get better,"" Nemeroff said, after purchasing a ticket on Friday night for ""Minari"" at Manhattan's independent movie theater Angelika.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Joining hundreds of women in Istanbul to protest at China's treatment of Uighurs, Nursiman Abdurasit tearfully thinks of her jailed mother in Xinjiang and fears that Uighurs like her in Turkey may one day be sent back under an extradition deal.
Beijing approved an extradition treaty between the two nations in December and with the deal awaiting ratification by Ankara's parliament, activists among some 40,000 Uighurs living in Turkey have stepped up efforts to highlight their plight.
Abdurasit came to Turkey to study in 2015 and lost contact with her family four years ago. Last summer she discovered her parents and two brothers had been given long jail sentences on suspicion of unspecified ""terrorism-related activities"".
""I have been living with the knowledge that my mother has been in a detention centre for the last four years, experiencing repression,"" she said at a protest to mark Women's Day on an Istanbul seafront, near China's Istanbul consulate.
The headscarved 32-year-old said she recalled International Women's Day was her mother's happiest day, when the family would give her presents, until she received the 13-year jail sentence. 
Around her, the 1,000-strong crowd held up photos of missing relatives and waved the blue-and-white flags of the independence movement of East Turkestan, the name by which the movement refers to Xinjiang.
U.N. experts estimate at least a million Uighurs and other Muslims are held in detention centres in northwest China's Xinjiang region and the United States said in January China has committed ""genocide and crimes against humanity"" by repressing Uighurs.
China denies accusations of abuses in Xinjiang, and has said the complexes it set up in the region provided vocational training to help stamp out Islamist extremism and separatism.
""China says that what we are doing is a crime, 'what you are doing is separatism, disparaging the state',"" said Abdurasit, voicing concern about the consequences of the extradition deal waiting in a Turkish parliamentary commission.
""If this agreement is ratified, we could be extradited for this crime. So we are worried,"" said the woman, who lives in a small Istanbul flat with her Uighur husband and six-year-old daughter.
Worries among Uighur Muslims living in Turkey have been exacerbated by Ankara's dependence on China for COVID-19 vaccines, having received 15 million doses from China's Sinovac Biotech and ordered tens of millions more.
However, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has denied that the extradition agreement would lead to Uighurs being sent back, describing it as a routine according similar to ones Turkey has with other countries. 
A Chinese embassy spokesperson said last month that Uighurs who have been holding regular protests near China's diplomatic premises in Turkey in recent months were trying to deceive Turkish people and damage bilateral relations.
""These people's aim with their made-up lies is to attack the Chinese government's Xinjiang policies, blacken China's image and exploit the problems related to Xinjiang,"" he said.

The embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the protest on Monday.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast's President Alassane Ouattara on Monday named his close confidant and chief of staff Patrick Achi as interim prime minister in place of Hamed Bakayoko, who is absent due health reasons.
Bakayoko was flown to France on Feb. 18 for medical checks. 
The government said in a statement on Friday that Ouattara had met Bakayoko during a visit in France last week, and given the state of the minister's health, it was recommended that he should stay longer in hospital. 
Bakayoko, a close ally of Ouattara, was appointed as prime minister in July 2020 following the sudden death of his predecessor Amadou Gon Coulibaly, who had been handpicked by Ouattara to succeed him. He also held the defence ministry portfolio.

A presidency statement said that Tene Birahima Ouattara, the president's brother, was handed the defence portfolio.

1018,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 08:25AM ET</span>","Exclusive: EU preparing sanctions on Myanmar military businesses, documents show","By Gabriela Baczynska and Robin Emmott
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is preparing to widen its sanctions on Myanmar's armed forces to target businesses they run, in protest at the Feb. 1 military coup, according to diplomats and two internal documents seen by Reuters. 
The measures, which diplomats said could be agreed by EU foreign ministers on March 22, would target companies ""generating revenue for, or providing financial support to, the Myanmar Armed Forces"", said one of the documents dated March 5. 
While the bloc has an arms embargo on Myanmar, and has targeted some senior military officials since 2018, the measures would be its most significant response so far since the coup.
EU diplomats told Reuters that parts of the military's conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), were likely to be targeted, barring EU investors and banks from doing business with them.
The conglomerates are spread throughout the economy from mining and manufacturing to food and beverages to hotels, telecoms and banking. They rank among the country's biggest taxpayers and sought partnerships with foreign companies as Myanmar opened up during the democratic liberalization.
A U.N. fact-finding mission in 2019 recommended sanctions against the two companies and their subsidiaries, saying they gave the army extra sources of revenue that could finance human rights violations.
A Myanmar junta spokesman did not answer a call seeking comment on the EU's plan to broaden its sanctions. 
Last week, the EU said it was suspending development funds to Myanmar, although it has so far declined to freeze trade preferences to one of Asia's poorest countries for fear of hitting mainly female workers in the textile sector.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Thursday said fresh sanctions were part of the EU's plans for economic punishment in response to the coup. 
""With these measures, we are aiming very deliberately at the decision-makers in the military. Further options, such as the listing of economic companies of the military, are already on the table and can be taken shortly,"" Maas told the German parliament.  
MORE INDIVIDUAL SANCTIONS
Like much of the West, the EU condemned the coup last month that unseated the government of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and EU foreign ministers called for her release and the restoration of civilian rule.
However, such calls have been ignored, and police and military have killed more than 50 people to quell daily demonstrations and strikes against the coup, according to the United Nations last week.
The EU's expected new sanctions, which are under preparation this week, follow a U.S. decision last month to target the military and their business interests. 
Additionally, the bloc is set to place asset freezes and travel bans on military officials and border guard police accused of the crackdown on protesters against the coup, the EU documents seen by Reuters showed, although names are still under discussion.
Suu Kyi's party won a 2015 election but the transition to democracy was brought to a halt by the coup that ousted her government as it was preparing to begin its second term after her National League for Democracy (NLD) swept a Nov. 8 election.

After economic pressures caused by the coronavirus pandemic put many out of work, Maysoun Abdelsalam and her husband Moataz Ibrahim pivoted to serving them food.
""We felt we were the support for each other, between us refugees. One person brings rice, one brings pasta,"" said Abdelsalam.
The couple, who were working as a journalist and a lawyer, left Sudan because of political pressures and came to Egypt with their three children in 2017 hoping to find some security and stability.
Abdelsalam, 36, and Ibrahim, 44, found a niche teaching the children of other Sudanese migrants, setting up the Future Generation Center for Education charity shortly after they arrived.
Though the economic downturn caused by the pandemic has not been as severe in Egypt as in some other countries, many migrants and refugees have lost their jobs.
""There's no work, and I can't find any help from anyone except this centre,"" said Zakaria Issa, who came to Egypt from fleeing war in Sudan's Darfur region. 
Last year, U.N. migration agency IOM estimated that a fifth of an estimated 6.3 million foreigners in Egypt were in need of assistance. More than 300,000 are registered refugees and asylum seekers, according to the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR. 
A few days a week the centre prepares meals with meat and vegetables to distribute to up to 400 families from Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Yemen, as well as some Egyptian families.
The centre, which has 15 staff members and is based in Giza, across the Nile from central Cairo, has served 14,000 meals over the past 10 months.
It is supported by‮ ‬charitable donations and local Egyptian NGOs, she said, including Mastoora, founded by Shurooq Mustafa. 

""These are people looking for better circumstances in this pandemic,"" said Mustafa. ""We wanted to be a refuge so that they feel they aren't alone.""

Human Rights groups are outraged over the deaths of what they said were legitimate activists under the guise of counter-insurgency operations, which came two days after Duterte told security forces they could kill rebels if they were holding a gun and to ""ignore human rights"". 
""The president's 'kill, kill, kill' order is legal because it was directed at armed rebels,"" his spokesman Harry Roque said in a briefing, adding the government would still investigate the incident.
The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, an influential church group, in a statement denounced the use of what it called unnecessary force and violence during ""Bloody Sunday"".
On Sunday, Lieutenant General Antonio Parlade, head of an anti-rebel task force, told Reuters the raids were ""legitimate law enforcement operations"", and authorities had search warrants for firearms and explosives.
Activists said the raids were reminiscent of police operations in which thousands of people have been killed as part of Duterte's signature war on drugs, in which police said all of the victims were armed and had resisted arrest. 
Among those killed was a coordinator of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, a left-wing group that has called for an end to ""red-tagging"", the practice of labelling opponents communists or terrorists to justify targeting them, which dates back to the the rule of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
Human Rights Watch said the government's counter-insurgency campaign no longer makes a distinction between armed rebels and non-combatant activists, labour leaders, and rights defenders.
Since coming to power in 2016, Duterte has seen his efforts to forge peace with Maoist rebels derailed repeatedly, prompting frequent outbursts and threats to wipe them out.

1021,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 08:05AM ET</span>",Trial implicating Honduran president in drug trafficking begins in New York,"NEW YORK CITY (Reuters) - The trial of an alleged Honduran drug-trafficker, whose case implicates Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and other high-ranking officials, gets under way in the Southern District of New York on Monday.
Geovanny Fuentes Ramirez, 50, was arrested trying to leave Miami in 2020 and has pled 'Not guilty' to charges of conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the United States and related weapons charges. 
References to Hernandez appear frequently in the filings against Fuentes Ramirez, as well as in a drug-trafficking case against Hernandez's brother Tony, who was convicted of drug trafficking and related weapons charges in October 2019. 
In that trial, U.S. prosecutors said Juan Orlando Hernandez had accepting millions in bribes from drug traffickers. The president has repeatedly denied the allegation.
In a tweet at the time, he said that the verdict was ""based on testimonies of confessed murderers,"" referring to former drug traffickers who cooperated with U.S. authorities in the trial. In comments to Honduran media, Hernandez has denied all wrongdoing.
In Fuentes' case documents, federal prosecutors accused Hernandez, who has been president since 2014, of using Honduran law enforcement and military officials to protect drug traffickers.
U.S. ALLY 
Hernandez was a key ally to the United States under both the Obama and the Trump administrations.
The investigation could not only affect future bilateral relations but also complicate the new Biden administration's efforts to invest $4 billion in Central America, including Honduras, to address the causes of migration.
Last month, thousands of Hondurans joined one of the largest-ever migrant caravans hoping to reach the United States, with many citing rampant violence, government corruption and worsening poverty as their reasons for leaving home. 
Democratic U.S. senators in late February introduced a bill that would sanction Hernandez for alleged drug trafficking and corruption and cut off financial assistance and ammunition sales to Honduran security forces. 
In addition to potentially shedding light on the extent of corruption and official involvement in drug trafficking in Honduras, revelations from Fuentes' trial could affect presidential primaries taking place in Honduras this month ahead of November's election. 
Previous court filings show that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration began investigating Hernandez and others for drug trafficking and money laundering around 2013, the year he was elected president after heading the parliament, or Congress. 
He was re-elected in a contested ballot in 2017 to hold office until early 2022. 
Hernandez has denied the allegations in the Fuentes case. In a tweet, the presidency said the idea that Hernandez had taken drug money from Fuentes or protected traffickers was ""100% false and appears to be based on the lies of confessed criminals who seek revenge or to reduce their sentences."" 
He has often represented himself as tough on drugs and claimed credit for breaking up powerful crime cartels and extraditing numerous traffickers to the United States.

U.S. prosecutors said the Honduran government has ""hardly been forthcoming"" with assistance in their investigations and said the government had not honored requests to extradite potential witnesses against the president.

The decision hinges on epidemiological data, Aristotelia Peloni told reporters.
In the mid-term, as vaccinations progress, the government plans to allow outdoor dining in April and to restart tourism, which accounts for about a fifth of Greece's economic output and employs one in five people.
How the sector fares will be crucial for the country which is slowly emerging from a decade-long debt crisis but which has seen sees its economy shrink sharply due to COVID-19 restrictions. 
Greece, which has suffered 6,758 COVID deaths, was recently forced to extend a lockdown in the wider Athens region to March 16 due to a resurgence in infections but Peloni said there were signs of hope ahead. 
""We still have tough days ahead of us. But we running the last mile in this marathon race,"" she said. 
The country registered 1,142 cases and 53 COVID-related deaths on Sunday. It has recorded a total of 205,120 infections since its first case emerged a year ago and its health sector, badly weakened during the financial crisis has been struggling. 

Most recently, with 466 patients currently intubated, authorities have been increasingly concerned about COVID admissions in state hospitals as most of them are operating at full capacity.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Child soldiers and other victims of convicted Congolese militia leader Bosco Ntaganda should get a total of $30 million compensation, International Criminal Court judges ruled on Monday, in their highest ever reparation order.
The judges said Ntaganda did not have the resources to pay the compensation himself. Instead they asked the tribunal's own Trust Fund to help set up and finance vocational and other programmes to support victims of his crimes.
Ntaganda was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2019 for murder, rape and other atrocities committed when he was military chief of the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) militia in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in 2002-2003.
Hundreds of civilians were killed and many thousands forced to flee during the fighting.
""The chamber hereby unanimously issues an order for reparations against mister Ntaganda (and) assesses mister Ntaganda's liability for these reparations at 30 million US dollars,"" judge Chang-ho Chung said.
As Ntaganda could not pay, ""the Chamber encourages the Trust Fund for Victims to complement the reparation awards to the extent possible and engage in additional fundraising efforts as necessary to complement the totality of the award,"" he added.
In 2020 the fund, which relies on voluntary contributions, had around 18 million euros in reserves and much of that was already pledged in other cases.
Victims eligible for the reparations programme include victims of attacks led by Ntaganda, child soldiers under his command, rape victims and children born out of rape.
The judges awarded collective reparations, meaning there will be no individual pay outs. Any money will instead go to charities or funds set up to help victims.

Ntaganda is appealing against his conviction.

The reopening of English schools to all pupils is the first step in a four-stage government plan to ease the lockdown while trying to prevent a new surge in infections after a devastating winter wave that severely strained hospitals.
Since the start of the pandemic, Britain has recorded 124,500 deaths within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test, the fifth highest official death toll in the world and the worst in Europe.
For adults in England, the lockdown remains in force, with social contact severely restricted, people under orders to stay at home except for essential reasons, most shops closed, and cafes and restaurants able to offer only takeaway or delivery.
""Getting all schools back has been our priority and the first step of our roadmap back to normality,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Twitter.
The reopening of schools is a huge relief to millions of parents who have spent months juggling work and full-time childcare.
Primary school pupils return to their classrooms and playgrounds with some COVID rules, such as not being able to socialise with children outside a strictly defined ""bubble"", staggered arrivals and departures, and frequent hand-washing.
For secondary schools and their pupils, the requirements are more onerous. Teenagers are being mass-tested for COVID -- a logistical headache for schools -- and are required to wear face coverings in class.
Despite these restrictions, the near-consensus among parents, teachers, child psychologists, social workers and broader society is that getting children back into schools is urgent for their mental health, education and life chances.
Most pupils had missed out on more than three months of school in the spring and early summer of 2020, when Britain was under its first strict national COVID lockdown.

In that first shutdown, as in the recent one, only children considered vulnerable or those whose parents are classified as ""key workers"" by the government were allowed to go to school. However, even they were not having normal lessons, as teachers were busy organising distance learning for all the others.

Vaccinations must be administered within three months of the travel period and visitors will still be required to show negative COVID-19 test results within three days of their departure, Anutin Charnvirankul told a news conference. 
Those not yet inoculated but with coronavirus-free certificates would be quarantined for 10 days, he said. 
""Foreigners travelling to Thailand with vaccination certificates in accordance with the requirements of each brands, will need to quarantine for only seven days,"" Anutin said, referring to the doses needed to be effective. 
Thailand's flight limits, its strict entry requirements and mandatory quarantine for all arrivals have been central to its success in limiting the spread of the virus to just over 26,000 cases and 85 deaths. 
Those curbs have decimated its vital tourism sector, however, prompting widespread jobs losses and business closures and contributing to the country's deepest economic traction in over two decades.
The country received close to 40 million visitors in 2019. 
The new measures do not apply to those travelling from Africa, who would still be subject to quarantine for two weeks due to concerns about other variants of the virus. 
Vaccinated Thai nationals without a certificate showing they are coronavirus-free need to spend one week in quarantine after two negative tests in the country. 
After October, if Thailand inoculates 70% of medical personnel and at-risk groups, there could be more easing of restriction, Anutin said, adding it was possible quarantine could be waived completely. 
Thailand has so far vaccinated 27,497 people, mostly medical workers, using the Sinovac Biotech vaccine. It has ordered 61 million doses in total of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine with mass vaccinations slated to begin in June

Anutin said the country may need to order an additional 10 to 20 million doses, which it could source from other producers.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 04:55AM ET</span>","Two-thirds of tropical rainforest destroyed or degraded globally, NGO says","By Jake Spring
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Humans have degraded or destroyed roughly two-thirds of the world's original tropical rainforest cover, new data reveals – raising alarm that a key natural buffer against climate change is quickly vanishing. 
The forest loss is also a major contributor of climate-warming emissions, with the dense tropical forest vegetation representing the largest living reservoir of carbon. 
Logging and land conversion, mainly for agriculture, have wiped out 34% of the world's original old-growth tropical rainforests, and degraded another 30%, leaving them more vulnerable to fire and future destruction, according to an analysis by the non-profit Rainforest Foundation Norway.
More than half of the destruction since 2002 has been in South America's Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and bordering rainforests.
As more rainforest is destroyed, there is more potential for climate change, which in turn makes it more difficult for remaining forests to survive, said the report's author Anders Krogh, a tropical forest researcher.
""It's a terrifying cycle,"" Krogh said. The total lost between just 2002 and 2019 was larger than the area of France, he found. 
The rate of loss in 2019 roughly matched the annual level of destruction over the last 20 years, with a football-field's worth of forest vanishing every 6 seconds, according to another recent report by the World Resources Institute. 
The Brazilian Amazon has been under intense pressure in recent decades, as an agricultural boom has driven farmers and land speculators to torch plots of land for soybeans, beef and other crops. That trend has worsened since 2019, when right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro took office and began weakening environmental enforcement.
But the Amazon also represents the best hope for preserving what rainforest remains. The Amazon and its neighbors – the Orinoco and the Andean rainforest – account for 73.5% of tropical forests still intact, according to Krogh.
The new report ""reinforces that Brazil must take care of the forest,"" said Ane Alencar, a geographer with the Amazon Environmental Research Institute who was not involved in the work. ""Brazil has the biggest chunk of tropical forest in the world and is also losing the most."" 
Southeast Asian islands, mostly belonging to Indonesia, collectively rank second in terms of forest destruction since 2002, with much of those forests cleared for palm oil plantations. 
Central Africa ranks third, with most of the destruction centered around the Congo River basin, due to traditional and commercial farming as well as logging. 
Forests that were defined in the report as degraded had either been partially destroyed, or destroyed and since replaced by secondary forest growth, Rainforest Foundation Norway said.
That report's definition for intact forest may be overly strict, cautioned Tasso Azevedo, coordinator of the Brazilian deforestation mapping initiative MapBiomas. The analysis only counts untouched regions of at least 500 square km (193 square miles) as intact, leaving out smaller areas that may add to the world's virgin forest cover, he said. 

Krogh explained that this definition was chosen because smaller tracts are at risk of the ""edge effect,"" where trees die faster and biodiversity is harder to maintain near the edge of the forest. A forest spanning 500 square km can fully sustain its ecosystem, he said.

Australia's parliament is under increased scrutiny over sexual assault allegations. 
Three female employees of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's Liberal party last month said they had been raped by the same man in 2019 and 2020. One of the alleged victims has lodged a complaint with police.
Last week, Attorney-General Christian Porter, the country's chief law officer, identified himself as the subject of a separate historical rape allegation, declared his innocence and strongly denied the claim.

""We have said several times that there will be an escalation because the state isn't doing anything,"" said Pascale Nohra, a protester in Jal al-Dib.""
Protests at the start of Lebanon's financial crisis in 2019 brought hundreds of thousands onto the streets to bring down the government.
On Monday, three main roads leading south into the capital from Zouk, Jal al-Dib and al-Dawra were blocked while, in Beirut itself, protesters briefly blocked a main road in front of the central bank. 
In Tyre, one man tried to burn himself by pouring gasoline on his body but civil defense stopped him in time, the state news agency said.
Tens of thousands of jobs have been lost in the crisis, bank accounts have been frozen and many have started to go hungry.
After an explosion devastated whole tracts of Beirut in August, the next government resigned. 
But the new prime minister-designate, Saad al-Hariri, is at loggerheads with President Michel Aoun and has been unable to form a new government to carry out the reforms that would unlock billions of dollars of international aid.
Since the Lebanese pound tumbled to a new low last Tuesday, protesters have been blocking roads daily.
On Saturday, caretaker prime minister Hassan Diab threatened to quit to raise the pressure on those blocking the formation of a new government.
Diab is meeting with President Aoun, several caretaker ministers, the central bank chief and financial and security officials on Monday, the state news agency said. 
Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai hit out at the politicians in his Sunday sermon:
""How can the people not revolt when the price of one dollar has surpassed 10,000 Lebanese pounds in one day, how can they not revolt when the minimum wage is $70?""

Iraqis welcomed the pope and said it was a chance for the world to see their perpetually crisis-hit nation in a new light.

WASHINGTON/KABUL (Reuters) - The U.S. government said on Sunday all options remain on the table for its remaining 2,500 troops in Afghanistan, saying it has made no decisions about its military commitment after May 1.
The State Department comments came after reports emerged that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had made a new urgent push for a United Nations-led peace effort that included a warning that the U.S. military was considering exiting Afghanistan by May 1.
Blinken in a letter to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said the United States is ""considering the full withdrawal of forces by May 1st as we consider other options"".
The letter, confirmed by senior Afghan officials, was sent to Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of the peace council, and was discussed and explained to Afghan leaders by U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad during his visit to Kabul last week, the officials said. 
""The letter was handed over to President Ghani and myself two days before the visit of Khalilzad,"" Abdullah told a gathering in Kabul on Monday. 
A State Department spokeswoman declined to confirm the letter's veracity, but said Sunday the United States has ""not made any decisions about our force posture in Afghanistan after May 1. All options remain on the table.""
According to the letter, the United States is pursuing high-level diplomatic efforts ""to move matters more fundamentally and quickly toward a settlement and a permanent and comprehensive cease-fire.""
The letter said the United States would ask the United Nations to convene foreign ministers and envoys from Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, India and United States ""to discuss a unified approach to supporting peace in Afghanistan.""
It added the United States will ask Turkey to host a senior-level meeting of ""both sides in the coming weeks to finalize a peace agreement.""
Blinken said in the event of a U.S. military withdrawal that he was concerned ""the security situation will worsen and that the Taliban could make rapid territorial gains,"" adding he hoped Ghani would ""understand the urgency of my tone.""
Peace negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban insurgents in Qatari capital of Doha, have largely stalled as U.S. President Joe Biden's administration reviews how to handle the peace process, including troops withdrawal.
Blinken in the letter mentioned that Washington had not concluded the review.
""We are considering the full withdrawal of our forces by May 1st, as we consider other options,"" he said in the letter.
Violence in Afghanistan has increased recently as peace talks between the Taliban and the government has made no progress. Both sides have said they were getting ready for a ""tough"" spring offensive.
On Saturday, Ghani said his government was ready to discuss holding fresh elections in a bit to push forward peace talks.
Afghan officials and western diplomats said that during Khalilzad's visit to Kabul he discussed the idea of an interim government after bringing Afghan leaders together for a multilateral conference outside the country. 
A Taliban spokesman in Doha said the group has received a proposed draft plan for the peace process and were reviewing it.

Ghani has strongly opposed the idea of the interim government and said any new government should be formed through elections.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Thousands of women joined protests by farmers on the outskirts of Delhi on Monday to mark International Women's Day, demanding the scrapping of new laws that open up agriculture produce markets to private buyers. 
Since December, many farmers accompanied by their families have camped at three sites on the outskirts of the Indian capital to oppose the biggest farm reforms in decades, which they say hurt them.
Wearing bright yellow scarves representing the colour of mustard fields, the women took centrestage at one key site, chanting slogans, holding small marches, and making speeches through loudspeakers to target the laws.
""This is an important day as it represents women's strength,"" said Veena, a 37-year-old from a farming family, who gave only one name in order to protect her identity.
""I believe if us women are united, then we can achieve our target much quicker,"" added Veena, who travelled from the northern state of Punjab to the sprawling Tikri protest spot.
More than 20,000 women gathered at the site near Delhi's border with the state of Haryana, police and event organisers said. 
""This is a day that will be managed and controlled by women, the speakers will be women, there will be a lot of feminist perspectives brought in, and discussions on what these laws mean for women farmers,"" said farm activist Kavitha Kuruganti.
""It is one more occasion to showcase and highlight the contribution of women farmers both in agriculture in India as well as to this movement.""
India says the reforms will bring private investment into a vast and antiquated farm sector, improve supply chains and cut colossal waste. 
Faced with the protests, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government offered to suspend the laws for 18 months, but the farmers have refused to back down, demanding their repeal.
Agriculture accounts for nearly 15% of India's $2.9 trillion economy and employs about half its workforce. 
Women farmers have as much at stake as men from the new laws, Kuruganti added.

""Markets that are distant as well as exploitative make single women farmers more vulnerable, and in any case a patriarchal society has discriminated and made them vulnerable.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Meghan, the wife of Prince Harry, accused Britain's royal family of raising concerns about how dark their son's skin might be and pushing her to the brink of suicide, in a tell-all television interview that will send shockwaves through the monarchy.
The 39-year-old, whose mother is Black and father is white, said she had been naive before she married into royalty in 2018, but that she ended up having suicidal thoughts and considering self harm after pleading for help but getting none.
Meghan said that her son Archie, now aged one, had been denied the title of prince because there were concerns within the royal family about ""about how dark his skin might be when he's born"".
""That was relayed to me from Harry, those were conversations that family had with him,"" Meghan recounted in an interview with Oprah Winfrey aired on CBS late on Sunday.
Meghan declined to say who had aired such concerns, as did Harry. He said his family had cut them off financially and that his father Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, had let him down and refused to take his calls at one point.
Buckingham Palace had no immediate comment about the interview, which aired in the early hours of Monday morning in Britain.
The two-hour broadcast was the most anticipated royal interview since Harry's late mother Princess Diana shared intimate details of her failed marriage to Charles in 1995, denting the heir's reputation and the family's standing in the eyes of the British public.
""The monarchy has just been hit by its worst crisis since the abdication"" of Edward VIII in 1936, said Republic, a campaign group that wants to abolish the monarchy. ""This rotten institution needs to go.""
Nearly three years since her star-studded wedding in Windsor Castle, Meghan described some unidentified members of the royal household as brutal, mendacious and guilty of racist remarks.
She also accused Kate, the wife of her husband's elder brother Prince William, of making her cry before her wedding.
While the family came in for open criticism, neither Harry nor Meghan attacked Queen Elizabeth directly.
Still, Meghan said she had been silenced by ""the Firm"" - which Elizabeth heads - and that her pleas for help while in distress at racist reporting and her predicament had fallen on deaf ears.
""I just didn't want to be alive any more. And that was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought. And I remember how he (Harry) just cradled me,"" Meghan said, wiping away tears.
'REALLY LET DOWN'
Harry and Meghan's announcement in January, 2020, that they intended to step down from their royal roles plunged the family into crisis. Last month, Buckingham Palace confirmed the split would be permanent, as the couple looks to forge an independent life in the United States.
Harry, 36, said they had stepped back from royal duties because of a lack of understanding, and he was worried about history repeating itself - a reference to the death of his mother Diana who was killed in a 1997 crash as her car sped away from chasing photographers.
Asked what his mother would say about events, he answered: ""I think she would feel very angry with how this has panned out and very sad."" He felt ""really let down"" by his father.
Harry denied blindsiding Queen Elizabeth, his grandmother, with his decision to shun life within the monarchy, but said Prince Charles stopped taking his calls at one point.
""I had three conversations with my grandmother, and two conversations with my father before he stopped taking my calls. And then he said, can you put this all in writing?""
Detractors say the couple wanted the limelight, but were not willing to live with the attention it brought. To supporters, their treatment shows how an outdated British institution lashed out against a modern, independent biracial woman.
LIES AND TEARS
There have also been allegations of bullying against Meghan which appeared in The Times newspaper in the buildup to the couple's appearance. Buckingham Palace said it would investigate the claims, adding it was ""very concerned"".
Meghan told Winfrey that people within the royal institution not only failed to protect her against malicious claims but lied to protect others.
""It was only once we were married and everything started to really worsen that I came to understand that not only was I not being protected but that they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family,"" Meghan said.
Meghan denied a newspaper story that she had made Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, cry before the wedding and said it was a turning point in her relations with the media and the palace.
""The reverse happened,"" Meghan said. ""A few days before the wedding she (Kate) was upset about something, pertaining to yes the issue was correct about the flower girl dresses, and it made me cry. And it really hurt my feelings.""
Meghan, who said they were not paid for the interview, conceded she had not realised what she was marrying into when she joined the British monarchy and ""went into it naively"".
The couple also revealed that Meghan, who is pregnant with their second child, was expecting a girl.
Harry said Meghan had ""saved"" him from his trapped royal life. ""I would disagree, I think he saved all of us. You made a decision that certainly saved my life,"" Meghan said. 

""This is in some ways just the beginning for us.""

1035,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 02:05AM ET</span>",Spotlight on Australia's vexed parliament on International Women's Day,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia launched a A$19 million campaign on International Women's Day urging people to ""unmute"" or speak up when they witness disrespect against women, as its parliament is under scrutiny over sexual assault allegations.
Minister for Women Marise Payne said in a statement that Australia had made progress towards gender equality, but that ""challenges remain"" in the home and workplace.
In launching the campaign, Payne, who is also the foreign affairs minister and acting defence minister, and Minister for Families Anne Rushton, were grilled over the government's response to historical rape allegations that have intensified scrutiny of the treatment of women in Australian politics.
Three female employees of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's Liberal party last month said they had been raped by the same man in 2019 and 2020. One of the alleged victims has lodged a complaint with police. 
Last week, Attorney-General Christian Porter, the country's chief law officer, identified himself as the subject of a separate historical rape allegation, declared his innocence and strongly denied the claim.
""We have all been shocked by the distressing revelations and allegations in recent weeks that particularly relate to the treatment of women in my workplace, in the Australian parliament,"" Payne said in her International Women's Day speech.
She later told reporters the events had driven ""a very broad national discussion about the treatment of women"".
""Everywhere I have been in the last week or so outside Canberra, in regional New South Wales, in Sydney itself, Western Sydney where I live and where I work, for many people these have been the subject of discussion.""
The Sex Discrimination Commissioner will conduct an independent inquiry into the workplace culture of Australia's Parliament and report its findings by November.
Rushton said the parliament needed to ""set an example for the Australian public"".
Morrison is resisting calls for another independent inquiry, into the historical allegations against Porter. Payne told ABC radio on Monday morning it was a ""very vexed"" situation, adding ""the Prime Minister has made his position very clear"".
Two cabinet ministers have taken leave amid the controversy. Porter has taken leave to improve his mental health. Defence minister Linda Reynolds has extended her medical leave. 

Reynolds first took leave on February 24 for a pre-existing heart problem in the wake of revelations a young female staff member had allegedly been raped on the couch in the defence minister's office in 2019.

1036,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 12:50AM ET</span>",Thai prosecutor indicts 18 over anti-government protests,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - A Thai prosecutor on Monday indicted 18 activists for their roles in anti-government rallies last year by a protest movement that has brought unprecedented challenges to the royal palace and military-dominated establishment. 
The youth-led movement sprang up last year calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and reform of the powerful Thai monarchy, breaking a longstanding taboo under the country's lese majeste law. 
Those indicted included three prominent leaders charged with sedition and lese majeste during rallies in September, where tens of thousands escalated calls for monarchy reforms.
The other 15 protesters face trial for sedition and breaching a ban on public assembly.
""There is sufficient evidence that the accused have committed wrongdoing,"" Chanchai Chalanonniwat, deputy spokesman for the Office of the Attorney General told reporters.
If the court rejects their bail requests, all 18 could be jailed later on Monday until their trials. 
Thailand's lese majeste law prohibits criticism or insults against the king, and each offense is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. 
Panupong Jadnok, one those charged with lese majeste, said his group was unfazed by the prospect of jail.
""I am not too worried,"" Panupong said.
""The activities we have done are only the beginning, and it will go ahead even without us.""
Thailand's youth movement has posed the biggest challenge so far to former army chief Prayuth, who they say engineered the rules of the 2019 election to keep himself in power. 
Protesters also say the constitution gives the king too much power and demand that some of it be curbed. 
Four other activist leaders are in jail awaiting trial over the same protests having been denied bail five times.

At least 63 people have been charged under lese majeste laws since November, according to the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights group.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Monday that China's planned changes to the electoral system could further delay a vote for the city's legislature, but she was still uncertain on the timing.
China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), is expected to approve on Thursday a resolution that will reduce democratic representation in Hong Kong institutions and vet any candidates for ""patriotism"". 
The measures will tweak the size and composition of Hong Kong's legislature and the committee selecting the chief executive further in favour of pro-Beijing figures. The electoral committee will also be given powers to select many of the legislators.
Speaking for the first time since returning from Beijing, where she attended the NPC opening last week, Lam said the changes ""logically"" mean that a vote for the Legislative Council needs to take place after an election for the members of the electoral committee, currently scheduled for December.
""At the moment I’m not yet in a position to tell you whether we could adhere to the September 5, 2021, as a day for the general election of the Legislative Council,"" Lam told reporters.
The vote was initially scheduled for Sept. 2020, but delayed for at least a year, with the government citing the coronavirus.
Riding high after mass 2019 anti-government protests, the pro-democracy opposition had slim hopes for an unprecedented majority in the city's mini-parliament.
But Beijing has since moved swiftly to reassert its control, with the imposition of a sweeping national security law in June 2020. Authorities have arrested most high-profile opposition politicians and activists for offences under the new law or related to the protests. 
With any public office holders now set to be vetted for their ""patriotism"", political parties disbanding, democratic politicians either in jail or in exile, and institutions stacked with pro-Beijing figures by design, it is unclear what room there will be left in the city for any opposition. 
Critics have decried Beijing's moves as the end of the road for democratic dreams in Hong Kong, whose mini-constitution states universal suffrage as its goal.

Lam said the measures will improve the city's ability to govern itself.

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's administration has faced public criticism after the Shukan Bunshun magazine said internal affairs officials wined and dined with NTT, as well as Suga's son, an executive at a company that produces television programmes for satellite broadcasters.
Yasuhiko Taniwaki, the vice-minister for policy coordination, was transferred to another section after an investigation by the internal affairs ministry confirmed he had attended the dinners, with NTT president Jun Sawada, among others.
""It's regrettable that something that seriously undermines trust in public affairs has occurred,"" said Ryota Takeda, the minister for internal affairs and communications.
Japan's National Civil Service Ethics Law forbids government employees from receiving gifts or entertainment from individuals or firms that could be seen to curry favour.
However, a Yomiuri daily poll published on Monday showed support for Suga's administration outstripping the non-support rate for the first time since December as new coronavirus cases declined.
Support for Suga's administration rose to 48% in the survey conducted between March 5 and 7, for an increase of nine percentage points from the previous month's poll.
A spokesman for NTT, which was previously state-owned, declined to comment on the case, saying only that it was considering setting up a third-party panel to investigate.
The internal affairs ministry oversees the telecom and broadcasting industries.
Suga apologised last week after a key government spokeswoman, who hailed from the internal affairs ministry and attended the dinners hosted by Suga's son along with other officials, resigned.

Lowering cellphone service charges has been a key policy goal for Suga.

WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea will increase its contribution to the cost of U.S. forces stationed in the country under an agreement reached with the United States, the State Department said on Sunday, easing an irritant in ties between the two allies.
The agreement reflects the Biden administration’s ""commitment to reinvigorating and modernizing our democratic alliances around the word to advance our shared security and prosperity,"" a State Department spokeswoman said.
The proposed six-year ""Special Measures Agreement"" will replace the previous arrangement that expired at the end of 2019.
The spokeswoman said the agreement included a ""negotiated meaningful increase in host nation support contributions,"" but gave no further details.
There are about 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea as deterrence against North Korea. More than 90% of Seoul's contributions under the previous agreement went directly back into the South Korean economy, the spokeswoman added. 
The negotiations had been gridlocked after former U.S. President Donald Trump rejected Seoul's offer to pay 13% more, for a total of about $1 billion a year, and demanded as much as $5 billion. Seoul currently pays Washington about $920 million a year.
The deal must still be approved by the South Korean legislature. South Korea's Foreign Ministry confirmed an agreement in principle in a statement, but offered no specifics.
“Both sides will make a public announcement and hold a tentative signing ceremony after completing internal reporting procedures. The government will resolve to sign an agreement in a swift manner to resolve its vacuum that has lasted more than a year,"" the ministry added. 
President Joe Biden has vowed to revitalize U.S. alliances after four years of strains under Trump and build a united front to counter the challenges posed by Russia, China and Iran. 
""Mr. Trump did what he believed was right and I respect his opinion, but more than anything else, I was disappointed at the way he asked,"" said Chun In-bum, a retired South Korean general and special forces commander who worked with the American military.
'NOT A FREELOADER'
South Korea began paying for the U.S. troop presence in the early 1990s, after rebuilding its war-devastated economy. The two countries signed a treaty of mutual defense at the end of the 1950-1953 Korean War, which provided the basis for the stationing of U.S. forces in South Korea.
Chun said the new deal was a win for the alliance because it would improve the overall conditions for U.S. forces, while the six-year extension would provide much-needed stability
""I hope that this agreement will highlight the fact that 'Korea is not a freeloader' and is and has been a reliable ally,"" he said.
The announcement came after South Korea's chief envoy, Jeong Eun-bo, arrived in Washington for the first face-to-face talks with U.S. envoy Donna Welton since Biden's administration took office in January.
After the last pact expired, some 4,000 South Koreans working for the U.S. military were placed on unpaid leave, prompting the two countries to scramble for a stopgap agreement to let them return to work.

The United States reached agreement with Japan last month on Tokyo's contribution to the stationing of about 55,000 U.S. forces there, keeping Japan's annual costs steady at about $1.9 billion.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian fisherman Tin Yusos tucks into a meal of the previous day's catch with his wife and granddaughter aboard a boat which doubles as their home moored by the banks of the Tonle Sap River. 
    They plan to set out for another day of fishing in the area of the Tonle Sap and Mekong rivers, though his expectations are low.
""There are no big fish anymore,"" said Tin Yusos, 57. In the past, he could get a haul of about 30 kilogram (66 lb) of fish a day. Now he often catches just over one kilogram, worth about 15,000 riel ($3.69).
Experts blame hydropower projects, sand mining, deforestation, wetland conversion and climate change for dramatic drops in water levels in the region's rivers, severely disrupting fishing and threatening food supplies for millions. 
The Mekong typically swells in the rainy season where it converges with the Tonle Sap River, causing an unusual reversed flow into the Tonle Sap Lake, filling it up and providing bountiful fish stocks.
But in recent years, the flows to Southeast Asia's largest lake have at times been delayed, a factor blamed on drought and hydropower dams upstream on the Mekong.
Whether or not China's 11 dams are harming downstream countries dependent on the 4,350 km (2,700 mile) river has become a geopolitical issue, with the United States urging Lower Mekong nations like Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia to demand answers.
Marc Goichot, an expert on the region's waterways at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), said dams and sand mining in particular can contribute to a loss of fish.
    ""Basically the entire system is under stress and changing,"" he said. ""We need to address the root causes of those changes and re-establish the key processes like movement of fish.""     
    Ly Safi, 32, another Cambodian fisherman, said that this year's catch had been his worst and he felt trapped in a livelihood with little future.
""Some fishermen could save up some money and have left to do businesses on land, but for us we can’t.""

DENVER (Reuters) - Three members of a police SWAT team were injured as officers broke up an unruly party attended by an estimated 800 people that spilled into the streets near the University of Colorado campus in Boulder over the weekend, authorities said on Sunday.
The violence erupted Saturday night in the neighborhood known as the Hill, adjacent to the university’s flagship campus, as police moved in to disperse the partygoers, who appeared to violate pandemic public health orders limiting crowd sizes and requiring the wearing of face coverings in public space.
Some in the crowd hurled rocks and bottles at the officers, overturned at least one civilian car and damaged a police vehicle and a fire truck, police said at a Sunday news briefing.
Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold said three officers suffered minor injuries when they were struck by projectiles.
No one was immediately taken into custody, Herold said, but investigators are reviewing police body-camera footage, as well as surveillance videos and social media posts to identify offenders who engaged in destructive or violent behavior.
""There will be arrests,"" she said.
At one point about 100 revelers charged toward outnumbered police officers who were forced to retreat to safety, the chief of police said.
Police deployed tear gas to disperse the crowd and regained control of the situation in about three hours, police said.
University officials said in a written statement that any students found to have broken the law face expulsion.
""Any student who is found responsible for having engaged in acts of violence toward law enforcement or other first responders will be removed from CU Boulder and not readmitted,” the statement said.
District Attorney Michael Dougherty said his office will prosecute rioters, and called their actions selfish just as the city is moving toward easing pandemic restrictions.
""Their callous disregard for our community’s safety and well-being is shameful,"" he said.

""We will prioritise the most pressing humanitarian and emerging needs and seek to ensure our humanitarian engagement is with and through non-government organisations, not with government or government-related entities,"" Payne said.
Australia bilateral defence ties with Myanmar's military are restricted to non-combat areas such as English language training.
Canberra will also continue to demand the immediate release of Sean Turnell, an economist and adviser to deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi, authorities said. Turnell has been detained with limited consular access since the Feb. 1 coup that overthrew Myanmar's elected government.
Hundreds of people gathered in Australia's largest city of Sydney over the weekend urging the Australian government to take a strong stance against the coup.
The Southeast Asian country has been plunged in turmoil after the army took over control of the country and detained elected leaders, with daily protests that United Nations said had killed more than 50 people.
""We continue to strongly urge the Myanmar security forces to exercise restraint and refrain from violence against civilians,"" Payne said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The names of women victimized by violence were painted late on Saturday on metal barriers erected around Mexico's national palace ahead of a major women's march as activists turned the fencing into a makeshift billboard for their movement.
Near the front of the colonial-era building that serves as both the president's offices and his residence, activists wrote: ""Victims of Femicide"" in huge letters across the top of the 10-foot-tall (3-m) barriers, with the names of many women scrawled underneath.
Last year, at least 939 women were victims of femicide, the term used for homicides that deliberately target women, according to government data.
""It's absolutely fundamental that they're written down because our struggle is for them,"" said activist Marcela, who declined to provide her surname, as she stood in front of the barrier.
""We women want to ask for justice and that people understand, and that the president, who lives here, knows that we're fighting because they are killing us,"" she added.
A day earlier, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador described the barriers, erected on Friday, as a needed tool to avoid provocation and protect the historic building from vandalism ahead of Monday's planned march on International Women's Day.
On Sunday, the leftist leader insisted that he had always believed in equality in a video he posted on social media, in which he also lashed out at those he derided as conservative critics who aim to attack his government.
""I'm not a male chauvinist. I'm in favor of the rights of women,"" he said, pledging never to repress the free assembly of protesters.

Similar metallic barriers were erected around the nearby orange-domed Fine Arts Palace, including its towering bronze sculptures, as city officials announced plans to deploy police downtown to protect marchers as well as the monuments, including some 2,000 female police officers.

1045,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2021 05:25PM ET</span>",Accountant faces pressure to turn on Trump in criminal probe,"By Joseph Tanfani and Jason Szep
(Reuters) - When lawyers asked Donald Trump more than a decade ago to identify who estimated values on some of his signature properties, he shrugged and pointed to his longtime accountant, Allen Weisselberg.
“I think ultimately probably Mr. Weisselberg,” he said, testifying in 2007 in a defamation lawsuit he brought against a journalist, a case that hinged on whether Trump had inflated the value of his business empire. “I never got too much involved, other than I would give my opinion.”
A judge dismissed that suit, but Trump’s comments illustrate the challenges now facing Weisselberg, 73, as he comes under scrutiny in Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance’s investigation into whether the former U.S. president and his Trump Organization committed financial crimes.
Few people have been as deeply involved in Trump’s finances as Weisselberg, a trusted figure in Trump’s family business who began working for Trump’s father, Fred, in 1973 at the company’s Brooklyn office, paying bills and tracking the rental payments from apartment towers.
Legal experts and a source familiar with the criminal investigation say prosecutors’ apparent goal is to convince Weisselberg to cooperate with the probe into Trump’s dealings.
“They want him to turn,” said the person familiar with the investigation.
A spokesman for Vance declined to comment. Lawyers for Weisselberg and Trump did not respond to requests for comment.
The Manhattan district attorney said in an August filing that the office is investigating “possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct” at the Trump Organization, though he has not fully disclosed the scope of the probe. In a September filing, he said “mountainous” misconduct allegations could justify a grand jury probe into possible tax fraud, insurance fraud and falsifying business records.
Vance’s office and a separate civil probe by New York Attorney General Letitia James are both examining whether Trump misrepresented the value of his assets for tax benefits, among other potential violations.
Weisselberg’s unique position in the Trump Organization puts him among a small number of people who could provide prosecutors with crucial evidence of intent to commit fraud. Legal experts say Trump may try to put distance between himself and any controversial valuations of his properties and businesses by citing Weisselberg’s role as financial gatekeeper, as he did in the 2007 defamation case.
“It may very well be that Weisselberg will be Trump’s defense in a criminal case,” said Michael Bachner, a defense attorney who once worked as a prosecutor with Vance in the Manhattan office.
If Trump argues that he merely relied on the advice of his accountants and lawyers, Weisselberg could be in the position of having to take the heat himself for any potentially fraudulent dealings, Bachner said - unless the accountant makes a deal with prosecutors and implicates Trump.
“If I’m Trump, I’ve got to be nervous about this,” he said.
The source familiar with the investigation said that, in addition to scrutinizing Weisselberg, prosecutors also asked questions about his sons, who also had connections with Trump: Jack Weisselberg, a director at Ladder Capital (NYSE:LADR) - a real estate investment firm that’s been a creditor for four Trump properties - and Barry Weisselberg, who managed skating rinks under Trump contracts with New York City.
Ladder Capital did not respond to requests for comment. Other Ladder executives, but not Jack Weisselberg, appear on loan documents involving Trump. 
Jack and Barry Weisselberg did not respond to requests for comment.
UNIQUE POSITION OF TRUST
On March 1, after the U.S. Supreme Court denied Trump's last-ditch effort to keep his tax records private, Vance’s office obtained millions of pages of records on Trump’s taxes and finances. His office has also added a prosecutor experienced in organized crime and corruption, Mark Pomerantz, to the Trump investigation team, and interviewed staff at Ladder Capital.
As the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer and executive vice president, Weisselberg developed a unique position of trust with Trump, according to interviews with four former Trump Organization officials. The accountant handled Trump’s personal finances as well as the company’s most sensitive financial information, the officials said.
Barbara Res, Trump’s former construction manager, said Weisselberg was part of the Trump family’s inner circle, but he kept an unassuming profile. “He was the only one of the executives who would refer to Donald as Mr. Trump,” she said. “He was that kind of guy.”
Res said Trump trusted Weisselberg as a pair of eyes to make sure Trump’s other accountants and lawyers were doing their jobs. “Allen wouldn’t go outside the company,” she said. “Allen wouldn’t talk; Allen could be trusted to keep things quiet.”
When Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, arranged for a hush-money payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels, Weisselberg was involved in cutting the checks, Cohen testified in a February 2019 hearing held by a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives. Weisselberg obtained limited immunity from federal prosecutors to provide information in the investigation that targeted Cohen; he was not charged with wrongdoing. Cohen pleaded guilty to tax evasion and campaign finance violations.
Vance could seek a court order granting him access to Weisselberg’s testimony in the federal case against Cohen, legal experts said.
During the 2019 committee hearing, Cohen identified Weisselberg as one of the Trump executives who knew that Trump inflated assets in statements to insurance companies for the purpose of reducing premiums. In response to questions from Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Cohen said he could not confirm a New York Times report on whether Trump under-reported values on inherited real estate to reduce his taxes.
“Who would know the answers to those questions?” she asked.

“Allen Weisselberg,” Cohen said.

Another 500 people were injured in the blasts that rocked the city of Bata. 
In a statement carried on national television, Obiang called for international support in the recovery effort, adding: ""I translate all my support to the people who are affected.""
Television station TVGE showed teams pulling people from piles of rubble, some of whom were carried away wrapped in bed sheets. A health official had earlier told TVGE the death toll was at least 20. 
Pick-up trucks filled with survivors, including children, drove up to the front of a local hospital. 
Inside, wards were overwhelmed with the wounded, many covered in blood. Some lay on the floor or on tables, awaiting attention. 
TVGE called on people to donate blood and said hospitals in the Central African nation were full. 
The blasts come as Equatorial Guinea, an oil producer, is suffering a double economic shock because of the coronavirus pandemic and a drop in the price of crude, which provides around three-quarters of state revenue. 
The former Spanish colony has been run by Obiang, Africa’s longest-serving leader, since 1979 when he staged a bloody military coup and ousted his uncle, who was later executed. 
Critics point out that Obiang and his family enjoy lavish wealth while the majority of the population lives in poverty.
In the blast area on Sunday, iron roofs were ripped off houses and lay twisted amid the rubble. Only a wall or two remained of most residences. 
In the immediate aftermath, people ran in all directions, many of them dazed and screaming. 
A column of smoke reached into the sky and around its base firefighters sought to put out the blaze.
""Following developments in Equatorial Guinea with concern after the explosions in the city of Bata,"" Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said on Twitter.

Dassault was the eldest son of late French billionaire industrialist Serge Dassault, whose namesake Dassault Aviation, builds the Rafale war planes and owns Le Figaro newspaper.
""Olivier Dassault loved France. Captain of industry, lawmaker, local elected official, reserve commander in the air force: during his life, he never ceased to serve our country, to value its assets. His sudden death is a great loss. Thoughts on his family and loved ones,"" Macron said on Twitter. 
The private helicopter crashed on Sunday afternoon in Normandy, where he has a holiday home, according to a police source. The pilot was also killed. 
A lawmaker for the conservative Les Republicains party since 2002, Dassault was considered the 361st richest man in the world alongside his two brothers and sister, with wealth of about 6 billion euros ($7.15 billion) mostly inherited from his father, according to the 2020 Forbes rich list.
He stepped down from his role on the board of Dassault due to his political role to avoid any conflict of interest. 
Olivier, seen as the favourite of founder Marcel, was once considered favoured to succeed Serge at the head of the family holding, but that role went to former Dassault Aviation CEO Charles Edelstenne.

The parliament has been split - as have most state institutions - since soon after it was elected in 2014, as Libya broke between warring factions in the east and west.
It is meeting this week to debate giving confidence to a government announced by Abdulhamid Dbeibeh, who was designated as prime minister last month through a political dialogue held in Geneva by the United Nations. 
Under that process, his government is intended only to oversee the run-up to an election planned for the end of this year and then to cede power to the new authority it creates. 
A military ceasefire under the same U.N. process has held since the autumn, after the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) turned back an assault on Tripoli by Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). 
The ceasefire was supposed to include reopening the main coast road through Sirte, which is held by the LNA. However, groups on the GNA side have refused to do so, saying pro-LNA foreign mercenaries remain near the frontline. 
It is not clear how many of the 200 parliament members elected in 2014 will attend the session, with about 75 having arrived by late on Sunday, parliament spokesman Abdullah Belhaq said. Some members have died, others have resigned and some have threatened to boycott the meeting. 
Debate on Monday will include discussion of what constitutes a legitimate quorum, and what majority is needed to confer confidence, the parliament rapporteur Saleh Galma said. 
If parliament is unable to agree on approving the new government, the U.N. talks forum has said it can do so instead.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas led a visit by Biden administration officials to the U.S. border with Mexico on Saturday amid a growing number of border crossings and criticism by Republicans that an immigration crisis is brewing.
President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has sought to reverse rigid immigration polices set up by his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, whose 2016 election and four-year presidency were dominated in part by his efforts to build a border wall and reduce the number of legal and illegal migrants coming into the United States.
Biden has faced criticism from immigration activists, too, who say unaccompanied migrant children and families are being held too long in detention centers instead of being released while their asylum applications are considered.
The White House said last week Biden had asked senior members of his staff to travel to the border to report back about the influx of unaccompanied minors making crossings. It declined at the time to release details about the timing of the trip, citing security and privacy concerns.
Mayorkas and other officials, including Biden's domestic policy adviser Susan Rice, visited a border patrol facility and a refugee resettlement facility during their Saturday trip, the White House said in a statement on Sunday. 
""They discussed capacity needs given the number of unaccompanied children and families arriving at our border, the complex challenges with rebuilding our gutted border infrastructure and immigration system, as well as improvements that must be made in order to restore safe and efficient procedures to process, shelter, and place unaccompanied children with family or sponsors,"" the White House said.
""Officials also discussed ways to ensure the fair and humane treatment of immigrants, the safety of the workforce, and the wellbeing of communities nearby in the face of a global pandemic.""
An influx of people seeking to cross the U.S. border is likely to be a big issue in the 2022 midterm elections; Trump may use it to rally his base against Biden and lay the groundwork for a potential return as a presidential candidate in 2024 or as a way to boost another Republican successor.

""The border is breaking down as I speak. Immigration in 2022 will be a bigger issue than it was in 2016,"" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) told Fox News's ""Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo"" program. Graham is a close ally of Trump.

The pontiff, winding up a historic trip to Iraq, met Abdullah Kurdi at the end of Mass in the Iraqi Kurdish city of Erbil, the Vatican said in a statement.
""The pope spent a long time with him (Kurdi) and with the help of an interpreter was able to listen to the pain of a father for the loss of his family,"" it said.
Kurdi thanked Francis for his closeness to the tragedy and to the pain of ""all those migrants who seek understanding, peace and security, leaving their country at the risk of their lives,"" it added.
Alan Kurdi drowned along with his mother and brother when a smuggling boat taking them to Europe capsized off the coast of Turkey in 2015. 
An image of his body washed up on the shore captured the world's attention as millions of Syrians fled the civil war there and many boarded unsafe ships bound for a Europe that eventually began shutting its doors. Many drowned trying to make the journey.
The pope has long called for more compassionate treatment of migrants and refugees. In Iraq, where Abdullah Kurdi now lives in the autonomous Kurdish region, the pontiff preached for an end to conflict and sectarian violence.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government would continue to do everything possible to secure her permanent release so she could return to the UK.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation, was arrested at a Tehran airport in April 2016 and later convicted of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. 
Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who served out most of her sentence in Tehran's Evin prison, was released last March during the coronavirus pandemic and kept under house arrest, but her movements were restricted and she was barred from leaving the country.
On Sunday the authorities removed her ankle tag. 
""She was pardoned by Iran's supreme leader last year, but spent the last year of her term under house arrest with electronic shackles tied to her feet. Now they're cast off,"" her lawyer Hojjat Kermani told an Iranian website. ""She has been freed.""
Iran's judiciary was not immediately available to comment about the release. Her family and the foundation, a charity that operates independently of media firm Thomson Reuters and its news subsidiary Reuters, deny the charge.
Kermani said a hearing for Zaghari-Ratcliffe's second case has been scheduled on March 14. 
""In this case, she is accused of propaganda against the Islamic Republic's system for participating in a rally in front of the Iranian Embassy in London in 2009 and giving interview to the BBC Persian TV channel at the same time,"" Kermani said.
He said he hoped that ""this case will be closed at this stage, considering the previous investigation"".
MIXED NEWS
In a tweet, Johnson said he was ""pleased to see the removal of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s ankle tag, but her continued confinement remains totally unacceptable"".
The prime minister added, ""She must be released permanently so she can return to her family in the UK, and we continue to do all we can to achieve this"".
Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband Richard Ratcliffe told Sky News on Sunday she was ""pleased"" her ankle tag had been removed but said the news was ""mixed"" from Iran due to the court summons. Ratcliffe did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Antonio Zappulla, CEO of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said the foundation was ""delighted that her jail term was ended"" and that she had told him she was ""'ecstatic' to be able to sit in a cafe and have a coffee"".
""Nazanin must be given her freedom, as was promised.""
British foreign minister Dominic Raab welcomed the removal of the ankle tag but said Iran continued to put Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family through a ""cruel and an intolerable ordeal"". 
""We have relayed to the Iranian authorities in the strongest possible terms that her continued confinement is unacceptable,"" Raab said in a statement. 
Her lawyer told Iranian state TV he had no news on the status of her travel ban.
The detentions of dozens of dual nationals and foreigners have complicated ties between Tehran and several European countries including Germany, France and Britain, all parties to Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers.

The release come as Iran and the United States are trying to revive the deal, which former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, then reimposing sanctions on Iran. Tehran responded by scaling down its compliance.

Saudi Arabia and its allies had agreed at a summit in January to end the political row which led to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cutting trade, travel and diplomatic ties with Qatar in mid-2017. Yemen's Saudi-backed government had followed suit.
Qatar denied their accusations that it supports terrorism.
The foreign minister had met his Qatari counterpart in Doha on Sunday, according to the Yemeni foreign ministry. An agreement was reached to restore ties, it said in a statement, and published an image of the Yemeni flag being raised at the embassy in Doha.
A statement by the Qatari foreign ministry said the two ministers reviewed bilateral relations but did not mention restoration of ties. The Qatar government media office did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.
Qatar Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani during the meeting underlined the need for a political solution to end the six-year war in Yemen, the statement said.
Qatar was initially part of a Saudi-led military alliance fighting in the war, but was kicked out in 2017 after the Arab boycott.
Since the January agreement, air and travel links have resumed between Qatar and the four states. Cairo restored diplomatic relations that month and Riyadh said it would do so.

Fellow Gulf Arab state Kuwait last month hosted bilateral talks with Qatar and Egypt, and with Qatar and the UAE, aimed at resolving individual differences.

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2021 10:51AM ET</span>",Mexican camp that was symbol of migrant misery empties out under Biden,"By Laura Gottesdiener
MATAMOROS, Mexico (Reuters) - A sprawling camp in the Mexican city of Matamoros, within sight of the Texan border, has since 2019 been one of the most powerful reminders of the human toll of former President Donald Trump's efforts to keep migrants out of the United States. 
The camp has dwindled to just a few dozen in residents in recent days, after hundreds of asylum seekers living there were finally allowed to cross the border to press their claim to stay in the United States.    
President Joe Biden last month rolled back the program - known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) - that had forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico.
Biden's wife, Jill, visited the camp during last year's presidential campaign to witness the difficult conditions first hand. 
""If it hadn't been for this camp, I don't think they would have ever ended MPP,"" said Honduran asylum seeker Oscar Borjas, one of the last remaining residents.
Like hundreds of asylum seekers expelled from the United States to this crime-ridden town, Borjas began sleeping near the foot of the international bridge across the Rio Grande out of fear and necessity. 
But the migrants also intended to make a statement, he said: a visible reminder of the human toll of the MPP program. ""We were there so that people would see us; see it wasn't fair what they were doing to us.""
As of Friday, some 1,127 people in the MPP program across Mexico have been permitted to enter the United States since Biden rescinded the policy last month. More than half of those were from the Matamoros camp, according to the U.N. refugee agency.
Once home to more than 3,000 people, the camp now stands largely deserted, except for the few whose appeals to enter the United States have been denied, Borjas said.
""I don't know what I'll do now. I can't go back,"" said Borjas, who said he faces the threat of murder in Honduras for supporting an opposition party.
    ""LET'S UNITE""
    The Trump administration touted the MPP program as part of its successful efforts to reduce immigration and cut down on what it called fraudulent asylum claims. 
Since 2019, the policy pushed more than 65,000 migrants back into Mexico as their asylum cases wound through U.S. courts. The majority gave up waiting and left Mexico. Thousands more crowded into shelters or apartments, disappearing from sight. 
    But in Matamoros, which had scant resources for migrants, families opted to sleep in the plaza at the foot of the bridge.
    ""We said 'Let's unite' and that's how the camp in Matamoros began,"" said Honduran asylum seeker Josue Cornejo, who was returned to Matamoros along with his wife and their children in  August 2019.
    Parents scavenged cardboard to stop the summer heat radiating off the pavement from burning their children's skin. The men formed a guard watch.
    Aid workers arrived. So did Matamoros' criminal groups, which doled out beatings and siphoned off donations, migrants say. 
    As the camp population ballooned, the tents sprawled from the plaza to the wooded banks of the Rio Grande, where residents braved contamination and undercurrents to bathe and wash their clothes. 
    The migrants resisted federal government efforts to house them in a makeshift shelter miles from the border.
    Life took root in a way migrants say they had never expected, making the lengthy wait in Mexico slightly more bearable.
    They formed church groups, supply distribution tents and kitchens with handmade earthen ovens and stoves improvised from old washing machines. 
    Nicaraguan asylum seeker Perla Vargas and other migrants launched a tent school that provided music, dance, English and Spanish classes to dozens of children each day, including her two grandchildren. 
    There were quinceaneras, romances, and at least one wedding.
    Consuelo Tomas, an indigenous Q'anjob'al Guatemalan asylum seeker, gave birth inside the camp and named her newborn Andrea in honor of the child's grandmother, who died years earlier trying to cross the Sonoran desert to reach the United States.
    Insecurity and hardship reigned. 
    The weather whiplashed between scorching heat and freezing cold. Human rights groups documented kidnappings and rape of asylum seekers in Matamoros. Occasionally, migrants' bodies washed up along the river bank. 
    Some mothers, including Salvadoran asylum seeker Sandra Andrade, sent their children to cross the U.S. border alone illegally out of concern for their safety. 
    ""It was one of the most difficult decisions I've had to make, but I wanted to protect them,"" she said.
    MATAMOROS TO WASHINGTON
    At times, the camp served as the launch pad for protests: from a blockade of the international bridge that halted traffic for hours to demonstrations and all-night vigils opposing Trump's re-election. 
    Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, said that MPP program might have succeeded in obscuring the plight of these migrants from the American public if it were not for the Matamoros camp.
    ""It was the one place where you couldn't deny that what we were doing was inflicting harm on people,"" he said.
    Last month, the Biden administration said it would allow about 25,000 migrants in MPP to enter the United States to pursue their cases. Matamoros camp residents were to be among the first in line, it added.
   Buoyed by the news, migrants had prepared for their departure in late February: snapping farewell photographs and snipping haircuts for fellow migrants. The sound of bachata music rang out as children hopped about, rehearsing for their final dance recital. Andrade packed up her remaining protest signs and distributed donated pairs of tiny sneakers. 

    ""It's so the kids can cross into the United States in brand new shoes,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will do what it sees as necessary to defend its interests after a rocket attack last week against Iraq's Ain al-Sada airbase, which hosts American, coalition and Iraqi forces, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Sunday.
Speaking on ABC's ""This Week"" program, Austin said the United States is urging Iraq to quickly investigate the incident at the base located in western Anbar province and determine who was responsible. U.S. officials have said the incident fit the profile of a strike by Iran-backed militia.
""We'll strike, if that's what we think we need to do, at a time and place of our own choosing. We demand the right to protect our troops,"" Austin said.
Asked if Iran had been given a message that U.S. retaliation would not constitute an escalation, Austin said that Iran is fully capable of assessing the strike and U.S activities.
""What they should draw from this, again, is that we're going to defend our troops and our response will be thoughtful. It will be appropriate,"" Austin said. ""We would hope that they would choose to do the right things.""
There were no reports of injuries among U.S. service personnel after the attack but an American civilian contractor died after suffering a ""cardiac episode"" while sheltering from the rockets, the Pentagon said.
Iraqi officials said 10 rockets landed at the base but the Pentagon was more guarded, saying there were 10 ""impacts."" It said the rockets appeared to have been fired from multiple sites east of the base, which also was targeted last year by a ballistic missile attack directly from Iran.

U.S. forces carried out air strikes against facilities at a border control point in Syria used by Iranian-backed militias including Kata'ib Hezbollah and Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada in February.

ZURICH (Reuters) - A far-right proposal to ban facial coverings in Switzerland was headed toward a narrow victory in a binding referendum on Sunday viewed as a test of attitudes toward Muslims.
Projections for broadcaster SRF, based on partial results, showed the measure passing 52% to 48%, with a two-point margin for error. Final results were due later on Sunday.
The proposal under the Swiss system of direct democracy does not mention Islam directly and also aims to stop violent street protesters from wearing masks, yet local politicians, media and campaigners have dubbed it the burqa ban.
""In Switzerland, our tradition is that you show your face. That is a sign of our basic freedoms,"" Walter Wobmann, chairman of the referendum committee and a member of parliament for the Swiss People's Party, had said before the vote.
He called facial covering ""a symbol for this extreme, political Islam which has become increasingly prominent in Europe and which has no place in Switzerland"".
The proposal predates the COVID-19 pandemic - which has required all adults to wear masks in many settings to prevent the spread of infection - and gathered the necessary support in 2017 to trigger a referendum.
The proposal compounded Switzerland's tense relationship with Islam after citizens voted in 2009 to ban building any new minarets. Two cantons already have local bans on face coverings.
France banned wearing a full face veil in public in 2011 and Denmark, Austria, the Netherlands and Bulgaria have full or partial bans on wearing face coverings in public.
Practically no one in Switzerland wears a burqa and only around 30 women wear the niqab, the University of Lucerne estimates. Muslims make up 5% of the Swiss population of 8.6 million people, most with roots in Turkey, Bosnia and Kosovo.
Swiss Muslims have said right-wing parties were using the vote to demonise them and rally supporters.
Amnesty International has called the face veil ban ""a dangerous policy that violates women's rights, including to freedom of expression and religion"".

The government had said the proposal went too far and recommended voters reject a ban.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Prime Minister Bisher al-Khasawneh reshuffled his cabinet on Sunday in a move meant to accelerate IMF-guided reforms seen as crucial to Jordan's economic recovery from the blow of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said.
Six new ministers were named including interior and justice after Khasawneh fired both incumbents last week for attending a restaurant dinner party that violated coronavirus restrictions they were supposed to enforce. 
In the new 28-member cabinet, Brigadier General Mazen Araya, who headed the COVID-19 crisis centre, was appointed interior minister in a shakeup seen as giving Khasawneh more scope to tackle social and economic problems, government officials said.
The British-educated Khasawneh, a veteran former diplomat and palace aide, was appointed last October by King Abdullah to restore public trust over the handling of the coronavirus health crisis and defuse anger over successive governments' failure to deliver on pledges of prosperity and curbing corruption.
Jordan is witnessing a nearly two-month-old surge of infections driven by a more contagious variant of the virus amid rising discontent over worsening economic conditions and curbs on public freedoms under emergency laws.
Aides say Khasawneh was expected to retain Harvard-educated Mohammad Al Ississ as finance minister. He has won International Monetary Fund praise for his handling of the economy during the pandemic, and has negotiated a four-year IMF programme worth $1.3 billion, signalling confidence in Jordan’s reform agenda.
The expected reshuffle comes after parliament last week passed a 9.9 billion dinar ($14 billion) budget which Al Ississ said aimed to maintain fiscal prudence to help ensure financial stability and rein in a record $45 billion public debt.
The economy saw its worst contraction - 3% - in decades last year, hit by lockdowns, border closures and a sharp fall in tourism during the pandemic, but the government and the IMF both predict a bounce of similar magnitude this year.

Officials say Jordan’s commitment to IMF reforms and investor confidence in the improved outlook helped the country maintain stable sovereign ratings at a time when other emerging markets were being downgraded.

At least five people have died in demonstrations sparked by the arrest on Wednesday of Ousmane Sonko, Senegal's most prominent opposition leader. It is the worst political unrest in years in a country widely seen as one of West Africa's most stable. 
Sonko, who enjoys strong support among the young, was arrested after an employee of a beauty salon accused him of raping her. Sonko denies the allegation and says it is politically motivated.
Opponents of President Macky Sall have called for further protests on Monday. 
The education ministry ""strongly recommends that students' parents keep a close eye on their children and keep them from the risks that come from the protests,"" it said in a statement. 
Much of Dakar turned into a war zone last week as police clashed with thousands of angry protesters. Many shops, gas stations and banks were closed for days. Large queues formed for petrol and groceries on Sunday, during what is expected to be a brief respite in the unrest. 
Political pressure has mounted on President Sall, whose presidency has been plagued by accusations that he unjustly torpedoes political rivals and worries that he may seek to extend his rule beyond his allotted two-term limit. 
The economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and a nightly curfew to contain its spread have only stoked frustrations. 
Pressure increased on Saturday after a 17-year-old boy was killed by gunfire in southern Senegal.

The influential League of Imams and Preachers of Senegal on Sunday called for the release of Sonko and a ""return to calm"".

SRINAGAR (Reuters) - Indian police have detained more than 150 Rohingya refugees found living illegally in the northern region of Jammu and Kashmir and a process has begun to deport them back to Myanmar, two officials said on Sunday.
Dozens of Rohingya are in a makeshift ""holding centre"" at Jammu's Hira Nagar jail after local authorities conducted biometric and other tests on hundreds of people to verify their identities.
""The drive is part of an exercise to trace foreigners living in Jammu without valid documents,"" said one of the two officials, who declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to the media.
""We have started the process of deportation of these refugees,"" the official added.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's federal government scrapped Jammu and Kashmir's special status in August 2019 and now administers the region from New Delhi. 
The Hindu nationalist government regards the Rohingya, who are Muslim, as illegal aliens and a security risk, and has ordered that thousands of them living in scattered settlements be identified and repatriated.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya were forced to flee their Buddhist-majority homeland after a crackdown by Myanmar's military in 2017. Most are in ramshackle camps on the border with Bangladesh. 
Myanmar denies accusations of genocide and says the army was fighting a legitimate counter-insurgency campaign.
Rohingyas living in Jammu said they were concerned about the weekend's detentions and the threat of deportation.
""We will go back when peace returns to our country,"" said Sufeera, 28, who said her uncle and brother had been sent to the holding centre, leaving her alone with her children.
Another refugee, 48-year-old Sadiq, said members of his family had also been detained.
""We have been told that we will be deported,"" he said. ""They took mother and father ... Who will take care of them?"".
India rejects a United Nations position that deporting the Rohingya violates the principle of refoulement – sending refugees back to a place where they face danger. 

Rohingyas staying in India have said conditions are not conducive for them to return to Myanmar after fleeing violence and persecution over the years.

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Facing elections for the first time in 15 years, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is battling a growing rift within his powerful Fatah party that poses a new threat to his dominance over Palestinian politics. 
A breakaway bid by one of Abbas's party allies has intensified speculation he might cancel a presidential vote planned for July, fearing a potential challenge by Marwan Barghouti, a popular Palestinian leader jailed by Israel.
Abbas's office denies he has plans to delay or scrub the presidential vote. 
Barghouti, now 61, was a driving force in Palestinians' 2000-2005 uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. He was sentenced by an Israeli court in 2004 to life imprisonment after being convicted over multiple lethal attacks on Israelis by Palestinian militants. Barghouti has always denied the charges.
Abbas, 85, has ruled the Palestinian Authority (PA) in self-rule areas of the West Bank by decree for over a decade. In January, he announced presidential and legislative ballots - a move largely seen as a response to domestic and Western criticism of his presidency's democratic legitimacy. 
Adding to that criticism is Nasser al-Qudwa, a longtime member of Fatah's top Central Committee who last week announced he was forming a new list that would run separately from Fatah in the legislative election, in May.
""(Palestinians) are fed up with the current situation ... internal behaviour or misbehaviour, things like the absence of the rule of the law, the absence of equality, the absence of fairness,"" Qudwa, a nephew of late Fatah founder and Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, told Reuters. 
It is rare for leaders on the 19-member Central Committee members to publicly break with Abbas. 
Qudwa, 67, said he hoped his list would be led by Barghouti, a Fatah leader long floated as a potential Abbas successor.
Barghouti has not said if he will join the list or run in the presidential ballot. He and his lawyer declined a request to interview him. But opinion polls suggest he would win comfortably against Abbas and leaders from Hamas, the Islamist movement that seized control of Gaza from Fatah in 2007. 
Aides to Abbas point to the split with Hamas as having contributed to the long delay in holding new elections.
FATAH DISCORD
Abbas has tried to resolve the discord by dispatching a loyalist to visit Barghouti in prison and, through emissaries, preaching party unity after Qudwa announced his new list. 
""Fatah, with strength and power, will run united in the upcoming democratic elections to strengthen democracy, maintain the national liberation project and protect Palestinian national unity,"" Hussein al-Sheikh, Abbas' civil affairs minister, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Palestinian officials have privately questioned how Barghouti would contest the elections from prison and what would happen if he won. Any move to free him would likely ignite a political firestorm in Israel. 
Two Western diplomats told Reuters that European countries were urging Abbas not to backtrack on his election pledge. 
""There's concern he (Abbas) might see a middle ground in allowing the legislative elections to go ahead, but postponing or cancelling the presidential election,"" one of them said. 
Abbas is due on Monday to convene a meeting of Fatah's Central Committee, where he is expected to formally sanction Qudwa.
Qudwa told Reuters he does not plan to attend committee meetings. 
It was not immediately clear how much support Qudwa's list would garner. About 250 Palestinians joined a Zoom conference call he held last week to announce the move. 
The Palestinians' last parliamentary ballot, in 2006, resulted in a surprise victory by Fatah's main rival Hamas. That created a rift that deepened when the Islamist group wrested military control of Gaza from the Fatah-led PA two years after Israel withdrew settlers and soldiers from the territory.
The elections are part of a broader push for reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, seen as vital to building broad popular support for any future statehood talks with Israel, frozen since 2014. 

Party lists for the legislative ballot are due by March 20.

The coalition, which said it had destroyed 10 armed drones, said in a statement on Saudi state media that ""civilians and civilian objects in the Kingdom are a red line"".
The coalition did not specify locations in the kingdom. The U.S. consulate in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah issued an advisory, citing reports of suspected attacks and explosions on Sunday near Jeddah and the southern town of Khamis Mushait.
In the Houthi-held Yemeni capital Sanaa, a Reuters witness reported several air strikes. Plumes of black smoke were visible in the vicinity of a military compound near Sanaa University. The Houthi-run Al Masirah TV said coalition warplanes bombed al-Nahda and Attan districts. 
The Houthis, who have been battling the coalition since it intervened in Yemen's civil war in March 2015, recently stepped up cross-border missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia. 
Fighting has also intensified on the ground in Yemen in Marib and Taiz regions.
The escalation comes as the United States and the United Nations increase diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire to pave the way for a resumption of U.N.-sponsored political talks to end the conflict, which is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. 
Saudi state media on Sunday cited the coalition as saying the Houthis were emboldened after the new U.S. administration revoked Washington's designation of the Houthis as a terrorist organization in February.
Last week, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two Houthi military leaders after the movement ramped up attacks on Saudi cities and its offensive in Marib.
The Houthis, who ousted the internationally recognised government from power in Sanaa in late 2014, deny being puppets of Tehran and say they are fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression. 
The war, in a military stalemate for years, has killed tens of thousands of people and has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.
Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said on Friday that Al-Thawra hospital in Taiz treated 28 people wounded in intense clashes since Wednesday and that the hospital itself was hit by gun fire, injuring three, including a 12-year-old boy.

In Marib, hundreds of fighters from both sides have been killed.

The raids in four provinces south of Manila resulted in the death of an environmental activist as well as a coordinator of left-wing group Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, among others, and resulted in the arrest of four others, activist groups said. 
""These raids appear to be part of a coordinated plan by the authorities to raid, arrest, and even kill activists in their homes and offices,"" Human Rights Watch Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson said in a statement.
These incidents, he said, were ""clearly part of the government's increasingly brutal counter-insurgency campaign.""
""The fundamental problem is (that) this campaign no longer makes any distinction between armed rebels and noncombatant activists, labour leaders, and rights defenders.""
The United Nations has warned in a report that ""red-tagging"", or labelling people and groups as communists or terrorists, and incitement to violence have been rife in the Southeast Asian nation.
""The Philippines government should act now to investigate the use of lethal force in these raids, stop the mayhem and killings that has gone hand in hand with the practice of red-tagging,"" Robertson said. 
Sunday's raids, which human rights group Karapatan condemned, came two days after President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the police and military to ""kill"" communist rebels and ""ignore human rights"".
""Nothing could be more apt than calling this day a ‘Bloody Sunday,’"" Karapatan's Cristina Palabay said. 
Lieutenant General Antonio Parlade, head of an anti-rebel task force, told Reuters the raids were ""legitimate law enforcement operations"", and authorities acted on the basis of search warrants for possession of firearms and explosives.

""As usual these groups are so quick in assuming that the subjects were activists and that they were killed. If (the) motive was to kill them they should all be dead but there were those who did not resist arrest so they were collared,"" Parlade told Reuters in a phone message.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Travis Cains looks over to the spot where he and George Floyd watched the world go by when they were young.
All that's left of the clubhouse across the street from the Cuney Homes projects where they debated sports and hip hop are two battered concrete steps now leading to nowhere. The clubhouse is long gone.
It was on those steps that Cains — who considers himself Floyd's older brother and stuck with him through the highs of sports stardom at school to the lows of addiction and incarceration — became convinced that Floyd was destined to make his mark on the world. 
""The whole neighborhood knew he would make history, but we didn't want it to be this way,"" Cains said. ""But we're breathing for him now. Floyd is a martyr for us. He will forever be a part of a movement."" 
Friends and family of Floyd spoke with Reuters in the days before the trial was set to begin on Monday of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. The Minnesota appeals court on Friday ordered the trial judge to reconsider adding a third-degree murder charge against Chauvin, a late development that could delay the start of proceedings.
Chauvin, who is white, used his knee to pin Floyd, who was Black, to the ground by his neck for nearly nine minutes on May 25 on a street in Minneapolis, where Floyd had moved from Houston. Police had arrested Floyd after a grocery store employee reported he had allegedly used a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Lawyers for Chauvin say he followed his police training and contend that the fentanyl, an opioid, Floyd had recently ingested, was the main cause of his death.
Floyd's aunt, Angela Harrelson, lives just outside Minneapolis. As a registered nurse she said she sought to help her nephew in his fight to maintain sobriety. 
""He was just excited, he thought Minnesota was such a clean and nice place,"" said Harrelson. ""This whole movement has been an awakening for Black Americans, but it also has been an awakening for white Americans as well, giving them knowledge that racism, systemic racism, does exist.""
Floyd's cousin Dexter Brown was traveling to Minneapolis for Chauvin's trial. 
""We don’t want to see somebody else’s child, somebody else’s father, somebody else’s cousin get done like this,"" Brown said. 
Jonathan Veal, friends with Floyd since age 12, owns a management consulting business in Oklahoma City. He applauded developments such as the ""George Floyd Justice in Policing Act"" passed last week by the U.S. House of Representatives. 
But Veal said what he finds more important are changes on the streets, where whites marched alongside Blacks to protest racism during a summer of demonstrations, and where African Americans lined up to vote in November's elections.
Racism embedded in American institutions created segregated and impoverished neighborhoods such as Houston’s Third Ward where Floyd and Veal grew up. Systemic racism can only be truly changed, Veal said, when the people who make up those systems evolve. 
Veal and three other classmates of Floyd created the ""88 CHUMP"" community organization — 88 was Floyd’s high school football jersey number and CHUMP stands for Communities Helping Underprivileged Minorities Progress — with goals that include getting more people registered to vote.
Cains, a retired bail bondsman, says he has devoted his life to fighting for human rights through the George Floyd Foundation.
Cains said he hopes anybody, regardless of race, can understand Floyd’s humanity. 
""For the police to do him like that, it just leaves any Black man to wonder: 'Man, does the world hate me that much? Is my skin color that bad, that you can just do us like that?'"" Cains said.
Floyd ""was trying to get his life right,"" Cains said. ""You could hear him telling the cops who killed him that 'I'm not a bad guy!'""
Between 1997 and 2005 Floyd was in and out of jail, mostly on theft and drug charges. He pled guilty in 2009 to aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon committed in 2007 and was sentenced to five years in prison. He was paroled in early 2013.
Patrick Ngwolo, a Houston criminal defense attorney and pastor who met Floyd after he left prison, described Floyd as his ""man of peace"" in the Third Ward. Ngwolo said he watched a familiar narrative play out after Floyd's killing. 
""By day three after he was murdered, you already saw the debate in the media: 'Was he a good guy? Is he not a good guy?'"" Ngwolo said. ""That's shifting the narrative from 'these killings are crazy, we have to do something about them.'"" 
Ngwolo believes that Floyd's death is an inflection point for America. 

""We're either going to master this original sin of racism in this country,"" he said, ""or it's going to master us.""

1070,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2021 06:10AM ET</span>",Socially distanced Iditarod race starts from secluded Alaska river site,"By Yereth Rosen
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Forty-seven mushers and their teams of huskies were due to begin their trek into the Alaska wilderness on Sunday for the 49th annual Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, on a course drastically altered by the coronavirus pandemic.
The starting line of the 2021 event has been placed off-limits to the usual crowds of cheering spectators, and none are expected anywhere along the abbreviated route for this year's running of the world's most famous sled-dog race.
Access to the start area - a secluded spot at the edge of a frozen river in Willow, Alaska, about 75 miles north of Anchorage – has been confined to competitors and essential race personnel. 
Canceled was the usual Saturday ceremonial kickoff to the race in Anchorage, a day of festivities that traditionally have packed Iditarod fans into the downtown district of Alaska's largest city.
And there will be no finish line in Nome, the Bering Sea town that has long served as the end point for a race course that roughly follows the path of the legendary diphtheria serum run to Nome by dog sled teams in 1925.
Instead, this year's race will run to an uninhabited checkpoint called Iditarod and an abandoned mining settlement named Flat, then turn around for a second leg sending mushers back to the starting line at the Deshka River in Willow.
The total distance is about 860 miles, roughly 100 miles shorter than the traditional route to Nome.
The coronavirus-altered route is designed to minimize contact with residents of the region. Even where the trail nears villages, the checkpoints are isolated with access restricted. The route skips all the native Athabascan villages along the Yukon River and all the Inupiat villages on the Bering Sea coast. 
With the coastal stretch en route to Nome bypassed for this year's race, the mountains of the Alaska Range will pose the greatest challenge to competitors.
""That’s kind of a critical portion of the race,"" Rod Urbach, the Iditarod chairman, said earlier in the week. And this year, he noted, mushers will have to cross the Alaska Range twice, from the south and from the north.
Spectators kept away from the actual trail will still be able to follow the trek on computer and smartphone screens, courtesy of an Iditarod video feed offering live coverage, commentary and features.
Among those planning to watch from afar was Thomas Waerner, last year’s Iditarod champion. Waerner had signed up to race this year, but travel from his home in Norway proved too difficult.
Waerner, in an emailed message, said he found it ""very sad"" to be missing this year’s Iditarod.
""When something is in your passion and heart it is hard to be placed on the sideline due to factors not in your power,"" he said.
The race, with its new out-and-back format, will be much different than normal, he said, and ""it is going to be fun to see the different strategies when they are not going along the coast and probably have more good trails, but in addition it can be very cold.""

Waerner encountered travel troubles last year, too. When he crossed the Nome finish line in March, 2020, global travel restrictions were just emerging. Waerner and his dogs wound up stuck in Alaska until June, when arrangements were made for a special flight back to Norway.

MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - Muslim and Christian residents in the ruined Iraqi city of Mosul told Pope Francis of their lives under brutal Islamic State rule on Sunday as the pontiff blessed their vow to rise up from ashes and told them that ""fraternity is more durable than fratricide.""
Francis flew into the northern city by helicopter to encourage the healing of sectarian wounds and to pray for the dead of any religion. 
The 84-year-old pope saw ruins of houses and churches in a square that was the old town's thriving center before Mosul was occupied by Islamic State from 2014 to 2017. He sat surrounded by skeletons of buildings, dangling concrete staircases, and cratered ancient churches, most too dangerous to enter.
""Together we say no to fundamentalism. No to sectarianism and no to corruption,"" the Chaldean archbishop of Mosul, Najeeb Michaeel, told the pope. 
Much of the old city was destroyed in 2017 during the bloody battle by Iraqi forces and an international military coalition to drive out Islamic State.
Francis, who on a historic first trip by a pope to Iraq, was visibly moved by the earthquake-like devastation around him. He prayed for all of Mosul's dead.
""How cruel it is that this country, the cradle of civilization, should have been afflicted by so barbarous a blow, with ancient places of worship destroyed and many thousands of people – Muslims, Christians, Yazidis and others – forcibly displaced or killed,"" he said.
""Today, however, we reaffirm our conviction that fraternity is more durable than fratricide, that hope is more powerful than hatred, that peace more powerful than war.""
Intense security has surrounded his trip to Iraq. Military pickup trucks mounted with machine guns escorted his motorcade and plainclothes security men mingled in Mosul with the handles of guns emerging from black backpacks worn on their chests.
In an apparent direct reference to Islamic State, Francis said hope could never be ""silenced by the blood spilled by those who pervert the name of God to pursue paths of destruction.""
He then read a prayer repeating one of the main themes of his trip, that it is always wrong to hate, kill or wage war in God's name.
Fighters of Islamic State, a Sunni militant group that tried to establish a caliphate across the region, ravaged northern Iraq from 2014-2017, killing Christians as well as Muslims who opposed them.
'AFRAID TO RETURN'
Iraq's Christian community, one of the oldest in the world, has been particularly devastated by the years of conflict, falling to about 300,000 from about 1.5 million before the U.S. invasion of 2003 and the brutal Islamist militant violence that followed.
Father Raid Adel Kallo, pastor of the destroyed Church of the Annunciation, told how in 2014 he fled with 500 Christian families and how fewer than 70 families are present now.
""The majority have emigrated and are afraid to return,"" he said.
""But I live here, with two million Muslims who call me father and I am living my mission with them,"" he added, telling the pope of a committee of Mosul families who promote peaceful coexistence among Muslims and Christians.
A Muslim member of the Mosul committee, Gutayba Aagha, urged the Christians who had fled to ""return to their properties and resume their activities"".
Francis then flew by helicopter to Qaraqosh, a Christian enclave that was overrun by Islamic State fighters and where families have slowly returned and rebuilt ruined homes.
In Qaraqosh, he received the most tumultuous welcome so far on the trip, with thousands of ecstatic people packing the roadsides to get of glimpse of their religious leader.
Most were not wearing masks despite a rising number of COVID-19 cases in the country.
""I can't describe my happiness, it's a historic event that won't be repeated,"" said Yosra Mubarak, 33, who was three months pregnant when she left her home seven years ago with her husband and son, fleeing the violence.
Francis has stressed inter-religious peace from the start of his trip on Friday. 

On Saturday he held a historic meeting with Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric and visited the birthplace of the Prophet Abraham, condemning violence in the name of God as ""the greatest blasphemy"".

1072,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2021 05:10AM ET</span>",China says Hong Kong needs electoral reform for 'brighter future',"BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese government's top diplomat State Councillor Wang Yi on Sunday said the electoral system in Hong Kong must be improved for long-term stability, saying reform would bring about a ""brighter future"" for the city.
China's plan to dramatically reform Hong Kong's electoral system, unveiled this week during the country's annual parliamentary session, is expected to upend the territory's governance and ensure Beijing loyalists are in charge.
Speaking at his annual news conference at the parliamentary session, Wang said there was no democracy in Hong Kong during colonial times, and that China has confidence electoral reforms will be beneficial.
""Hong Kong's transition from chaos to governance is fully in the interests of all parties,"" said Wang.
A year ago, China imposed a tough national security law on the former British colony, saying it was needed following months of sometimes violent anti-government protests.
Beijing has since said that it will directly vet electoral candidates for the city's legislature and declared that only ""patriots"" should rule Hong Kong.
""Loving Hong Kong and patriotism are exactly the same,"" said Wang on Sunday, adding that changes to the electoral system are constitutional and justified.
It comes a week after Hong Kong police detained 47 pro-democracy activists on charges of conspiracy to commit subversion, the largest such mass arrest to date under the new national security law. 
China's actions in Hong Kong have been condemned by the United States and its allies to the anger of the Chinese government, which has said Hong Kong issues are an internal matter with which foreigners have no right to interfere.
Supporters of the national security law - which punishes what it broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison - have said the legislation is necessary to restore stability in Hong Kong after months of pro-democracy protests in 2019.

1073,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",China says hopes U.S. will remove 'unreasonable' curbs on cooperation,"By Gabriel Crossley
BEIJING (Reuters) - China urged the United States on Sunday to remove ""unreasonable"" curbs on cooperation as soon as possible and work together on issues like climate change, while accusing Washington of bringing chaos in the name of spreading democracy.
Last week U.S. President Joe Biden singled out a ""growing rivalry with China"" as a key challenge facing the United States, with his top diplomat describing the Asian country as ""the biggest geopolitical test"" of this century.
Speaking at his annual news conference, the Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, struck a tough line even as he outlined where the world's two biggest economies could work together.
Questioned about recent U.S.-China frictions over Taiwan, Xinjiang and the disputed South China Sea, Wang said Beijing ""will never accept baseless accusations and smears"". 
The United States had used democracy and human rights as a basis for arbitrarily interfering with other countries' affairs, he said. ""The U.S. should realise this as soon as possible, otherwise the world will continue to experience instability.""
Wang added that differences between China and the United States must be managed carefully, the two sides must advocate healthy competition not zero-sum finger-pointing, and that areas like climate change and fighting the pandemic were where they could cooperate.
""It is hoped that the United States and China will meet each other halfway and lift the various unreasonable restrictions placed on Sino-U.S. cooperation to date as soon as possible, and not create new obstacles artificially.""
The United States and China are at odds over influence in the Indo-Pacific region, Beijing's economic practices, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights in China's Xinjiang region. 
The Biden administration has indicated it will broadly continue the tough approach to China taken by former President Donald Trump, but do so in coordination with allies. 
Wang warned that on Chinese-claimed Taiwan there was no room for compromise, urging the new U.S. government to change the previous administration's ""dangerous acts of playing with fire"". 
Biden's team says the U.S. commitment to democratic Taiwan is ""rock solid"".
During Trump's administration, the United States levied a series of sanctions against China and its officials over Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Beijing's economic policies, which have not been lifted under the new administration.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said he agrees with his predecessor Mike Pompeo's determination that genocide against Muslims is underway in Xinjiang.
Activists and U.N. experts say 1 million Muslim Uighurs are held in Chinese camps. China denies abuses and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.
Wang addressed accusations over human rights abuses in Xinjiang, saying some Western politicians chose to believe lies about the region, and took a dig at Western countries' record.
""When it comes to 'genocide', most people think of North American Indians in the 16th century, African slaves in the 19th century, Jews in the 20th century, and the Australian aborigines who are still fighting today,"" he said.

""The so-called 'genocide' in Xinjiang is ridiculously absurd. It is a rumour with ulterior motives and a complete lie.""

Security forces cracked down on many of the protests. 
Police fired tear gas and stun grenades on protesters in the country's main city Yangon and in Lashio town in the northern Shan region, videos showed A witness said police opened fire to break up a protest in the historic temple town of Bagan, and several residents said in social media posts that live bullets were used.
There was no word of any casualties.
Video posted by media group Myanmar Now showed soldiers beating up men in Yangon, where at least three protests were held despite overnight raids by security forces on campaign leaders and opposition activists.
The United Nations says security forces have killed more than 50 people to stamp out daily demonstrations and strikes in the Southeast Asian nation since the military overthrew and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1. 
""They are killing people just like killing birds and chickens,"" one protest leader said to the crowd in Dawei, a town in the country's south. ""What will we do if we don't revolt against them? We must revolt.""
A local campaign manager for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy died in custody after being arrested in Yangon on Saturday night, a legislator from the now dissolved parliament said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. The cause of Khin Maung Latt's death was not known, but Reuters saw a photograph of his body with a bloodstained cloth around the head.
Residents in the city said soldiers and police moved into several districts overnight, firing shots. They arrested at least three people in Kyauktada Township, residents there said. They did not know the reason for the arrests.
""They are asking to take out my father and brother. Is no one going to help us? Don't you even touch my father and brother. Take us too if you want to take them,"" one woman screamed as two of them, an actor and his son, were led off.
Reuters was unable to reach police for comment. A junta spokesman did not answer calls requesting comment.
The state-run Global New Light Of Myanmar newspaper quoted a police statement as saying said security forces were dealing with the protests in accordance with law. It said the forces were using tear gas and stun grenades to break up rioting and protests blocking public roads. 
""PUNCHED AND KICKED""
Well over 1,700 people have been detained under the junta by Saturday, according to figures from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group. It did not give a figure for overnight detentions.
""Detainees were punched and kicked with military boots, beaten with police batons and then dragged into police vehicles,"" AAPP said in a statement. ""Security forces entered residential areas and tried to arrest further protesters, and shot at the homes, destroying many."" 
Myanmar authorities said on Saturday they had exhumed the body of 19-year-old Kyal Sin, who has become an icon of the protest movement after she was shot dead in Mandalay on Wednesday wearing a T-shirt that read ""Everything will be OK"".
State-run MRTV said a surgical investigation showed she could not have been killed by police because the wrong sort of projectile was found in her head and she had been shot from behind, whereas police were in front.
Photographs on the day showed her head turned away from security forces moments before she was killed. Opponents of the coup accused authorities of an attempted cover-up.
The killings have drawn anger in the West and have been condemned by most democracies in Asia. The United States and some other Western countries have imposed limited sanctions on the junta. China, meanwhile, has said the priority should be stability and that other countries should not interfere.
Protesters demand the release of Suu Kyi and the respect of November's election - which her party won in landslide but which the army rejected. The army has said it will hold democratic elections at an unspecified date.
Israeli-Canadian lobbyist Ari Ben-Menashe, hired by Myanmar's junta, told Reuters the generals are keen to leave politics and seek to improve relations with the United States and distance themselves from China.
He said Suu Kyi had grown too close to China for the generals' liking.

Ben-Menashe said he had also been tasked with seeking Arab support for a plan to repatriate Rohingya refugees, hundreds of thousands of whom were driven from Myanmar in 2017 in an army crackdown after rebel attacks.

The first person visit by a top official of the new U.S. President Joe Biden's administration will focus on enhancing cooperation, said the source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Austin plans to meet Defence Minister Rajnath Singh during his visit some time in the week of March 15, the official added.
The first Black U.S. defence chief will join Secretary of State Antony Blinken on a visit to Japan and South Korea, sources told Reuters on Thursday. It was not immediately clear if Blinken will also visit India.
The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi referred a request for comment to the Defense Department, which could not be reached outside regular business hours.
For India, closer bilateral military ties could bring greater access to American technology, as New Delhi tries to modernise its defence system amid tensions with neighbouring China in the western Himalayas.
India and China last month began to pull back troops and battle tanks from a bitterly contested lake area high in the Himalayas, in a breakthrough after a months-long standoff on the disputed border between the two nuclear-armed giants.
The standoff began in April when India said Chinese troops had intruded deep into its side of the Line of Actual Control or the de facto border in the Ladakh area in the western Himalayas.

U.S. defence manufacturers hope closer ties will boost their own prospects in India, which is one of the world's biggest defence spenders but still has major gaps in its military capabilities.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States will conduct its springtime military exercise this week, but the joint drill will be smaller than usual because of the coronavirus pandemic, Seoul said on Sunday.
The allies will begin a nine day ""computer-simulated command post exercise"" on Monday, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.
South Korea and the United States decided to move forward with the drills after ""comprehensively taking into consideration the COVID-19 situation, the maintenance of the combat readiness posture, the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and the establishment of peace,"" the JCS said, noting that the exercise is ""defensive"" in nature.
The drills will not include outdoor manoeuvres, which have been carried out throughout the year, and the number of troops and equipment will be minimized due to the pandemic, Yonhap news agency reported.
The exercises also provide a chance to assess South Korea’s readiness to take over wartime operational control (OPCON), and the series of scaled back drills could complicate President Moon Jae-in’s drive to complete the transfer before his term ends in 2022.
Even before the pandemic the drills had been reduced to facilitate U.S. negotiations aimed at dismantling Pyongyang’s nuclear programmes.
The combined drills are closely monitored by North Korea which calls them a “rehearsal for war”.
While Pyongyang has sometimes responded to such drills with its own shows of military force, it may be unlikely to do so this time, said Chad O'Carroll, CEO of Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea.
""I think there’s too much on the domestic agenda going wrong to risk any significant tit-for-tat escalation,"" he said on Twitter. ""And this is a government which tends to focus most of its resources on dealing with one key issue at a time.""

North Korea's drastic measures to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak have exacerbated human rights abuses and economic hardship, including reports of starvation, for its citizens, already battered by international sanctions, a United Nations investigator has said.

Johnson has announced a roadmap for lifting lockdown measures that sees schools open first, followed in later stages by the gradual easing of restrictions on mixing with other people and the re-opening of non-essential shops and other venues. 
In the final stage, which will take place no earlier than June 21, the government hopes to remove all remaining legal limits on contact with others.
""The reopening of schools marks a truly national effort to beat this virus,"" Johnson said. 
""It is because of the determination of every person in this country that we can start moving closer to a sense of normality – and it is right that getting our young people back into the classroom is the first step.""
Each step on the roadmap will depend on the level of COVID-19 cases, the government has said. It hopes the pandemic can be contained by a vaccine programme that has already delivered a dose to nearly 22 million people, as well as regular testing.
Many secondary schools and colleges had already started inviting students for their first ""lateral flow"" COVID-19 tests, which give rapid results, with nearly 1 million conducted last week, the government said.

After three initial tests on site, students will be provided with two tests to use each week at home, it said, adding that nearly 57 million tests had been delivered to schools and colleges across the country.

LONDON (Reuters) - A highly anticipated Oprah Winfrey interview with Prince Harry and his wife Meghan airs on U.S. television later on Sunday, amid what one royal watcher called a ""toxic"" atmosphere between the couple and the British monarchy.
Not since the late Princess Diana appeared on television to share intimate details of her failed marriage to Harry's father, Prince Charles, has an interview with members of the royal family attracted so much attention.
Having severed their official royal ties, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will explain why they abandoned Britain to move to California and start new lives.
""I'm ready to talk,"" Meghan, a former American actress, told Winfrey in an excerpt shown on U.S. station CBS on Friday, saying it was ""liberating"" to be able to give the interview.
Meghan and Harry's detractors say the couple want the glamour of their positions without the dedication it requires or scrutiny it brings.
To their supporters, their treatment shows how an outdated British institution has lashed out against a modern, biracial woman, with undertones of racism.
In another extract released ahead of the broadcast, Meghan accuses Buckingham Palace of ""perpetuating falsehoods"" about them, saying they would not be silent in telling their story.
A source close to Harry and Meghan said they wanted to have their say as they began a new chapter - moving home with a baby on the way after ending royal duties and on the back of a successful court case against a tabloid newspaper.
'REVENGE'
Some experts said the interview could damage the royal family, just as the split between Charles and Diana did.
""The interview is a form of revenge,"" royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams told Reuters. ""The link in people's minds can only be the constant attacks on each other by Charles and Diana, which were so damaging to the monarchy in the 1990s.""
Since their wedding in May, 2018, which had all the pomp of a traditional British royal occasion with a sprinkling of Hollywood stardust, Harry and Meghan have become global celebrities.
But they have railed against media intrusion, successfully waging legal battles with photographers and newspapers, including a privacy case against the Mail on Sunday which printed extracts of a letter Meghan wrote to her estranged father.
Rifts within the House of Windsor also appeared, with Harry admitting he had fallen out with elder brother Prince William. 
The decision to do the sit-down interview with Winfrey, recorded some two weeks ago, has already attracted criticism, partly because it will air while Harry's 99-year-old grandfather Prince Philip, the queen's husband, is in hospital.
He underwent a procedure for a pre-existing heart condition on Wednesday.
There have also been allegations of bullying against Meghan which first appeared in The Times newspaper. It said a senior aide raised a complaint in October 2018 from staff alleging Meghan had reduced some of her assistants to tears and treated others so badly that they quit.
Buckingham Palace, which has made no comment on the interview, said it would investigate the claims, saying it was ""very concerned"".
In response to the report, a spokeswoman for Meghan said she was ""saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself.""
Fitzwilliams said the Palace's move appeared to be a ""pre-emptive strike"" ahead of the interview.
On the same day as the broadcast, members of Queen Elizabeth's family will deliver a televised Commonwealth Day message saying how communities have come together during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Winfrey interview is set to be broadcast in Britain on Monday as well as in many other countries around the world.

""I have not seen enthusiasm at this level for a royals-related story since the weddings - the royal weddings of both Meghan and Harry and William and Kate,"" said Michelle Tauber, senior editor for U.S. magazine People.

KABUL/ISLAMABAD/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan proposed a shakeup of the stalled peace process this week, including an interim government and a conference of key players, according to diplomatic and political sources, but his plan faced immediate objections by the warring sides.
    Afghan-born U.S. diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad is on a visit to Kabul, Doha and other regional capitals, his first since U.S. President Joe Biden's administration began reviewing its options for the peace process and as time runs out before a May 1 U.S. troop withdrawal deadline.
    With peace negotiations in the Qatari capital making little progress and violence in Afghanistan escalating, Khalilzad is trying to build consensus around alternative options with all Afghan sides and key regional players, sources said.
    ""(The United States) thinks Doha isn't working and needs impetus and an alternate approach,"" said one diplomatic source who closely follows the process. 
    In Kabul, Khalilzad met Abdullah Abdullah, the chief peace envoy, President Ashraf Ghani and other political and civil society leaders, including former President Hamid Karzai.
    Three diplomatic sources, two sources on the teams of political leaders who met with Khalilzad and two international sources in Kabul said one of the envoy's main proposals was an interim government arrangement, referred to as a participatory or representative government. 
    A former Afghan government official familiar with the matter said Khalilzad shared a document detailing the power-sharing proposal and that it revised a paper he circulated in December.
    Another proposal was a meeting with a similar format to the 2001 Bonn conference, to involve representatives from a wide range of Afghan parties meeting in person while international agencies and diplomats push them to a solution.
    Anti-Taliban leaders met under international auspices in the German city of Bonn after the 2001 U.S.-led invasion ousted the insurgents from power and agreed on a provisional administration and a roadmap for forming a permanent government and writing a new constitution. 
    ""We're considering a number of different ideas that might accelerate the process,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters on Friday.
""The United States is not making any formal proposals and is continuing to review all relevant options for future force posture - and all means all,"" a State Department spokesperson said on Saturday. ""Ambassador Khalilzad has discussed a range of ways to move the diplomacy forward, nothing more.""
The two international sources said Khalilzad is asking the United Nations to take a lead role and call the conference.
    Spokespeople for the U.N. mission in Afghanistan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
    Two of the sources said the conference could be held in Turkey, but a third cautioned that location might meet resistance from Western nations and other countries including Germany and Uzbekistan were being considered. 
CHALLENGES AHEAD
   Khalilzad's plans immediately encountered objections from both the Afghan government and the Taliban. 
    Ghani made a fiery speech in Afghanistan's parliament on Saturday, repeating his refusal to step aside for an interim government. ""Any institution can write a fantasy on a piece of paper and suggest a solution for Afghanistan"" he said, warning any transfer of power would have to take place through elections as required by the constitution.
    Two international officials in Kabul said Ghani's fierce opposition would be a problem for the plan. 
    ""The problem here is that Ghani can blame the United States directly ... by challenging his legitimacy and considering an interim government it implies they are undermining the democratic process,"" one of the officials said.
    A Taliban leader in Doha who spoke on condition of anonymity said Khalilzad raised the possibility of an interim government and a conference with the insurgents' negotiating team, as well as asking for a ceasefire or reduction in violence by 60-70%.
    ""Khalilzad has come with some ideas and his top agenda is the intra-Afghan dialogue to deliver some tangible results and very soon,"" he said. 
    He said the Taliban would not join an interim government, but was not opposed to one being formed.
    ""We would recommend people with a good reputation for the interim government and this set up would need to work for at least two years to depoliticise all the government departments, including the security establishment,"" he said.
    They could consider the reduction in violence, but not a ceasefire, the Taliban leader said, and had asked Khalilzad to pressure the Afghan government to release 7,000 more Taliban prisoners.
    ""We don't believe any other conference in any country would help resolve the Afghan conflict,"" he said.
    Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said they had not yet seen the plan, but if an alternative to talks in Qatar was sought, ""it is doomed to failure.""
    Two sources said Khalilzad was expected to visit Islamabad, Pakistan, a key player in the peace process, on his trip.

    The envoy was the architect under President Donald Trump's administration of a February 2020 deal between Washington and the Taliban, which envisaged the Afghan government and Taliban negotiating a peace agreement and setting a final withdrawal of foreign forces by May 1.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - More than a hundred murders of Mexican officials and candidates in recent months point to the country's midterm elections becoming the most violent in decades, local consulting firm Etellekt said in a report.
Between September 2020 and the first week of March, 126 Mexican politicians and candidates were assassinated.
On June 6, Mexicans will elect 500 lawmakers, 15 governors and more than 20,000 local officials. 
""So far, the number of these crimes is lower than that registered in the 2018 elections, but it is increasing,"" said Ruben Salazar, director of the consultancy.
""In March alone, one politician been assassinated per day. If this rate continues, it could be the most violent elections since the Mexican Revolution,"" he said, referring to the armed conflict between 1910 and 1917.
Salazar said most of the politicians assassinated were members of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which was in power various times between 1930 and 2000.
Attacks against all politicians increased by 4%, compared with the 2018 presidential elections, with cases of kidnapping, robbery, violence and threats, among other crimes, the report released on Friday showed.

Rosa Rodriguez, head of the Security Ministry, promised this week a protection plan for candidates. The plan establishes protocols depending on the level of political violence, crime incidence and risks for the electoral process, Rodriguez said.

The boy was killed during clashes in the southern town of Diaobe, said the official, who asked not to be named. Protesters also burned down a military police station and ransacked several government buildings, the official said.
At least five people have died in protests sparked by Wednesday's arrest of Ousmane Sonko, Senegal's most prominent opposition leader. It is the worst political unrest in years for a country widely seen as one of West Africa's most stable.
A spokesman for Senegal's military police confirmed one person had died during clashes in Diaobe but did not say under what circumstances. He said protesters ransacked six police stations across the country on Saturday. 
Sonko, who finished third in the 2019 presidential election, was arrested after an employee of a beauty salon accused him of raping her. Sonko denies the allegation and says it is an attempt by Sall to kneecap a political rival.
The government denies this. 
The mostly young protesters cited a range of other grievances too, including high unemployment and strict measures to control the coronavirus that have inflicted economic pain, especially on informal workers. 
Many are especially dubious about the accusation against Sonko because two other top rivals of Sall were previously targeted by criminal charges that prevented them from running for president in 2019. 
In a statement, the opposition Movement to Defend Democracy (M2D) coalition called for three days of nationwide protests beginning on Monday. 

""M2D ... calls on the Senegalese people to pursue its mobilisation and peaceful struggle by using all of its constitutional rights to reject the dictatorship of Macky Sall,"" it said.

Farage, who as leader of the eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP) applied pressure on the government to hold the 2016 EU referendum, said the Brexit Party had helped the Conservatives ""come to their senses"" and chose Boris Johnson as their leader with a pro-Brexit agenda.
""The final outcome (of Brexit) has cut off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and treated our fisherman terribly, but we are out and there is no going back,"" he said in a statement. 
""Already, in terms of the vaccine rollout and trade deals around the world, we are seeing the benefits of Brexit and the EU itself turn into a laughing stock.""

The prince was joined by other royals, including his elder son and heir Prince William, in talking about the impact of COVID-19 in messages recorded for a programme marking Commonwealth Day dedicated to the countries, mainly from the former British empire, that maintain links with Britain.
""The coronavirus pandemic has affected every country of the Commonwealth, cruelly robbing countless people of their lives and livelihoods, disrupting our societies and denying us the human connections which we so dearly cherish,"" Charles said in the message. 
""Amidst such heartbreaking suffering, however, the extraordinary determination, courage and creativity with which people have responded has been an inspiration to us all.""
The prince's message will feature in the programme on British television on Sunday hours before an interview with his younger son Prince Harry and Harry's wife Meghan is shown in the United States.
Excerpts of the pre-recorded Oprah Winfrey interview have shown Meghan, 39, saying she is ""ready to talk"" about her experience of marrying into Britain's royals in 2018.
The queen's grandson and his wife stunned the royal family in January last year by announcing they would step down from their official royal roles to forge a new, independent life in California.
The split was confirmed last month, and, in the last week, the couple and Buckingham Palace have engaged in an increasingly bitter war of words, amid claims of lies, bullying and smears.
It also comes as the queen's 99-year old husband Prince Philip is in hospital in London after undergoing a procedure to treat a heart condition.
Commonwealth Day is usually marked with a service held at London's Westminster Abbey, but it was cancelled this year due to the pandemic. 

It will be replaced by a special programme - A Celebration for Commonwealth Day - which will be broadcast on BBC One at 1700 on Sunday.

Hundreds of people were asked to leave the area - popular for strolling and picnicking on sunny days - and police officers closed the riverbanks for the rest of the day. 
""Social distancing rules are not being respected,"" police called out through a megaphone.
The police has regularly been clearing the area over the past few weeks with warmer weather bringing people out to take advantage of the sunshine before a curfew kicks in from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. 
The Paris police on Friday banned the consumption of alcohol on the riverside and asked people to limit their gatherings.
The government has resisted putting the capital and its surrounding area back under lockdown despite a rise in coronavirus cases and growing numbers of patients in the capital's intensive care units. 
The country reported 23,306 new confirmed COVID-19 cases on Saturday, just slightly down from 23,507 on Friday. There were 170 new deaths, taking the total to 88,444.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Jean Castex pledged to accelerate the vaccine rollout, including at weekends, in two dozen high-risk zones to stave off further restrictions after criticism over the country's slow vaccination progress.
""This Saturday, at 17h30, 220,000 French people have been vaccinated, more than twice as many as last Saturday. We continue tomorrow,"" Health Minister Oliver Veran said on Twitter. 

As of Saturday, 3.581 million people have received a first jab in France.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - In Buenos Aires on Friday night the doors of the Colón Theater reopened for the first time in a year since being shut because of the coronavirus pandemic, a sign of how the capital of Argentina is slowly letting its hair down once again.
In neighboring Brazil, however, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have gone in the opposition direction, both announcing tighter restrictions this week, a reflection of how the two regional powerhouses are on completely different tracks battling the virus.
""It makes me very happy, we have to go to the theater again, we have to lose our fear,"" Fanny Mandelbaum, a local Argentina journalist attending the inaugural concert at the famed opera house told Reuters. ""It is so satisfying to be in a room and share culture with other people.""
The symbolic opening of the opera house, which dates back as far as 1857 - though in a different building - comes hot on the heels of film buffs in the capital being able to return to cinemas at the start of this month.
Authorities have also eased restrictions allowing restaurants and bars to stay open later, with indoor dining, bringing a buzz back to the city which had one of the region's longest and toughest lockdowns last year.
But in Brazil, Sao Paulo state imposed a partial lockdown this week, underscoring mounting concerns about a surge in new infections. Rio de Janeiro, meanwhile, adopted new restrictions, including a nighttime curfew.
""We've reached a grave moment of the pandemic. The coronavirus variants are hitting us aggressively,"" Brazil's Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said on social media.
The divergence of the region's urban nighttime revelers illustrates the different trajectories Argentina and Brazil are on in the race to tame COVID-19, even as inoculation programs are hit by delays. 
Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has long sought to diminish the gravity of the virus, while Argentina's President Alberto Fernandez has taken a tougher stance.
Claudio Mendez, Argentina manager for cinema chain operator Cinepolis, said that as vaccines were rolled out they hoped cinemas could return to normal after what had been an incredibly a tough year.
""It was a situation not imaginable even in the worst horror movie,"" he said. ""We believe as the vaccination process advances ... film premieres will begin to flow more normally.""
Back at the Colón Theater, many musicians still played with their masks on, while wind instrument players were inside transparent cubicles to avoid the potential spread of the virus. The audience was temperature checked and seating was spread out.

""We needed to go back and today was the day,"" said María Victoria Alcaraz, the opera house's general director. ""The spirit was to reopen the doors as soon as possible so that the public and the artists could come together one again.""

In a country where femicides rose nearly 130% between 2015 and 2020, critics said the decision to erect the 10-foot-high (3-meter) barriers was symptomatic of Lopez Obrador's apathy toward the crisis of violence afflicting women. 
Ahead of International Women's Day on Monday, barriers were also installed around other emblematic buildings and monuments in downtown Mexico City where a year ago tens of thousands of people protested rampant violence against women and impunity.
""We have to avoid provocation of people who only want to cause damage,"" Lopez Obrador said at an event in Yucatan. ""Imagine, if we don't take care of the national palace and they vandalize it. What image will this send to the world?""
Lopez Obrador reiterated that women had the right to protest and cited his own movement in 2006 as an appropriate form of peaceful protest.
""The presidency was stolen from us ... and we protested but never broke glass. ... I walked two, three times all the way from Tabasco to Mexico City,"" he said. Lopez Obrador has repeatedly accused opponents of electoral fraud over the years.
At least 939 women were victims of femicide last year in Mexico, official data shows. 
Interior Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero said on Twitter that the barriers were ""for the protection of the women.""
Anger among women was stoked this year after Felix Salgado, who has been accused of rape, announced his candidacy for governor for the southern state of Guerrero.
A representative for Salgado did not reply to repeated requests for comment; media reported that he has denied the allegations. 

Lopez Obrador has said that those calling on him to drop support for Salgado, a member of the ruling Morena party, are politically motivated.

TV images showed police shoving some protesters. The police said six officers were injured, one of whom was taken to hospital. Fifty people were moved on under a temporary pandemic law.
""Police have taken the decision to break up the non- authorised gathering which is ongoing,"" Stockholm police said on their website on Saturday.

Sweden, which has 10 million inhabitants, registered 4,831 new coronavirus cases on Friday, and 26 new deaths, taking the death toll to 13,003.
The government said last month that it would cut opening hours for restaurants, bars and cafes and tighten limits on the number of people allowed in shops, in a bid to ward off a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The centre-left government has gradually tightened restrictions since late last year after keeping most schools, restaurants and businesses open, relying primarily on voluntary measures.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An Israeli-Canadian lobbyist hired by Myanmar's junta said on Saturday that the generals are keen to leave politics after their coup and seek to improve relations with the United States and distance themselves from China. 
Ari Ben-Menashe, a former Israeli military intelligence official who has previously represented Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe and Sudan's military rulers, said Myanmar's generals also want to repatriate Rohingya Muslims who fled to neighboring Bangladesh. 
The United Nations says more than 50 demonstrators have been killed since the Feb. 1 coup when the military overthrew and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy party won polls in November by a landslide. 
On Friday, a U.N. special envoy urged the Security Council to take action against the junta for the killings of protesters. 
In a telephone interview, Ben-Menashe said he and his firm Dickens & Madson Canada had been hired by Myanmar's generals to help communicate with the United States and other countries who he said ""misunderstood"" them. 
He said Suu Kyi, Myanmar's de facto leader since 2016, had grown too close to China for the generals' liking.
""There's a real push to move towards the West and the United States as opposed to trying to get closer to the Chinese,"" Ben-Menashe said. ""They don't want to be a Chinese puppet."" 
President Joe Biden's administration has denounced the coup and imposed sanctions on the army and businesses it controls. A U.S. State Department official declined to comment.
Ben-Menashe said he was speaking from South Korea after a visit to Myanmar's capital Naypyidaw, where he signed an agreement with the junta's defense minister, General Mya Tun Oo. He said he would be paid an undisclosed fee if sanctions on the military are lifted.
A spokesman for the military government did not answer calls seeking comment on Saturday. 
Ben-Menashe said he had been tasked with contacting Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to get their support for a plan to repatriate the Rohingya, a Muslim minority. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled military assaults in 2016 and 2017 in which soldiers killed indiscriminately, raped women and torched houses, according to a U.N. fact-finding mission. 
""It's basically trying to get them some funding for the return of what they call the Bengalis,"" said Ben-Menashe, using a term some in Myanmar use for the Rohingya to imply they are not from the country.
Hundreds of thousands of people have protested in almost every town and city in Myanmar for weeks demanding the release of Suu Kyi and respect for the results of November's election, which the military says was marred by fraud. 
Ben-Menashe said the junta could prove the vote was rigged, and that ethnic minorities were blocked from voting, but provided no evidence. Election observers have said there were no major irregularities.
He said that on his two visits to the country since the coup, ""disturbances weren't that widespread"" and the protest movement was not supported by most Myanmar people. 
Ben-Menashe said police were handling protests, not the military, despite photos and video footage of armed soldiers at the demonstrations. He argued that the military was best placed to oversee a return to democracy after the coup it staged.

""They want to get out of politics completely,"" he said, ""but it's a process.""

Around 30 Myanmar police and their family members came across the border seeking refuge in recent days, as the junta's suppression of protesters has turned increasingly violent, with dozens killed since the Feb. 1 coup.
The senior-most official in Champhai, a district in the Indian state of Mizoram, told Reuters that she had received a letter from her counterpart in Myanmar's Falam district requesting the return of eight police ""in order to uphold friendly relations."" 
Deputy Commissioner Maria C.T. Zuali said on Saturday that she was ""waiting for the direction"" from the India's Ministry for Home Affairs in New Delhi. 
Although there have been instances recounted on social media of police joining the civil disobedience movement and protests against the junta, this is the first reported case of police fleeing Myanmar.
In the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, Myanmar authorities said they had information on eight police personnel who had crossed into India. The letter listed details for four police, aged between 22 and 25 years, including a female officer.
""In order to uphold friendly relations between the two neighbour countries, you are kindly requested to detain 8 Myanmar police personnel who had arrived to Indian territories and hand-over to Myanmar,"" the letter said.

India's federal home ministry did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters. India's foreign ministry responded to a request for comment by referring to a statement given at a media briefing on Friday which said the ministry was still ""ascertaining the facts.""

Diab's cabinet resigned on the back of the Aug. 4 Beirut port explosion that devastated swathes of the capital. Prime minister-designate Saad al-Hariri was nominated in October but has failed to form a new cabinet since due to political deadlock between him and President Michel Aoun.
An ongoing financial crisis, which erupted in 2019, has wiped out jobs, raised warnings of growing hunger and locked people out of their bank deposits. A new cabinet could implement reforms needed to trigger billions of dollars of international aid. 
""If seclusion helps with cabinet formation then I am ready to resort to it, although it goes against my convictions for it disrupts the entire state and is detrimental to the Lebanese,"" Diab said in a televised speech.
""Doesn't the scramble for milk constitute a sufficient incentive to transcend formalities and roughen out the edges in order to form a government?"" Diab said referring to the recent incident at a Beirut supermarket in which shoppers fought over powdered milk. 
A video of the squabble went viral on social media, leaving many people shocked at the desperate state of the economy.
Groups of protesters have been burning tyres to block roads across the country on a daily basis since the Lebanese currency tumbled to a new low on Tuesday, enraging a population long horrified by the country's financial meltdown.
The collapse of the Lebanese pound, which fell to 10,000 to the dollar on Tuesday, was the last straw for many who have seen prices of consumer goods such as diapers and cereals nearly triple since the financial crisis erupted.
On Saturday demonstrators protested in front of the banking association, demanding access to their deposits, and then walked to the parliament building in downtown Beirut to express their frustration at the deteriorating economic conditions. 
""Social conditions are aggravating, financial conditions are putting a severe strain on the country, political conditions are increasingly complex,"" Diab added in his speech. 

""The country is confronted with enormous challenges that a normal government cannot face without political consensus so how can a caretaker government face these challenges?""

The two Americans, both from California, have said they did not know that Cerciello or his partner, Andrea Varriale, were police officers, telling the court that neither man had identified themselves. 
Varriale has denied this, testifying that they had shown their two assailants their badges. Cerciello's badge was not found at the crime scene.
Elder and Natale-Hjorth were in Rome on holiday at the time and had tried to buy drugs from a local dealer. They have told the court that they were cheated, but managed to snatch a bag off an intermediary as he tried to get away. 
They subsequently agreed to meet the dealer again to get their money back in exchange for the bag, but instead the two policemen showed up. Neither man was in uniform and Elder has testified that they immediately attacked them, forcing him and Natale-Hjorth to defend themselves.
""I panicked and believed he wanted to kill me,"" Italian media quoted Elder as telling the court earlier this month.
Police say Cerciello, 35, was unarmed at the time and was stabbed 11 times by Elder with an 18-cm (7-inch) blade. 
Italian media have reported that the dealer was an informer who had reported the theft of the bag, asking the police to intervene.
In a court appearance last September, Elder apologised for the killing. 
Natale-Hjorth initially told police he had not been involved in the killing and did not know his friend had a knife. However, his fingerprints were found on a panel in the ceiling of their hotel room where the knife had been concealed.

Lawyers for Elder and Natale-Hjorth have yet to present their defence. A verdict in the trial is expected in April, legal sources said.

The wraparound cloths, known as longyi, are hung on washing lines. Sometimes women's underwear is used too.
""The reason why we hang the longyis across the streets is that we have the traditional belief that if we pass underneath a longyi, we might lose our luck,"" said one 20-year-old protester who declined to give his name for fear of reprisals. 
""The younger generation nowadays doesn't believe it anymore, but the soldiers still do, and it's their weakness. So, we might gain more time to run if they come towards us in case of emergency.""
Videos on social media have shown police taking down the lines of clothes before crossing them. Traditionally walking beneath items used to cover women's private parts is not only bad luck, but emasculating for men.
Reuters was unable to contact police for comment.
For more than one month, protesters have demonstrated across Myanmar against the Feb. 1 military coup and the arrest of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and hundreds of others. More than 50 protesters have been killed by security forces.
The lines of clothing do not stop police using teargas, rubber bullets and stun grenades. Some protesters have also been killed by live bullets. The army has said it has responded to the protests with restraint.

The army seized power alleging fraud in a November election won by Suu Kyi's party. The electoral commission had dismissed its allegations.

A youth-led protest movement sprang up last year calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and reform of the powerful monarchy. Thai courts have denied recent requests for bail for some of the jailed protest leaders.
""Release our friends,"" shouted the protesters in unison, as they gathered in front of a criminal court, which was surrounded by barbed wire. A water cannon truck could be seen behind the gates of the court. 
""Abolish 112,"" they also said, referring to Thailand's lese majeste law, or Article 112 in the Thai criminal code, which prohibits anyone from insulting or defaming the king. 
A few protesters burned photographs of the king at the rally. Separate groups also led two other protests at other locations in Bangkok. 
Earlier on Saturday, police warned protesters that they risked being arrested and that police might use harsher measures if protesters became unruly. 
""Protests are illegal. Anyone who joins or invites others to join is breaking the law,"" Piya Tavichai, deputy commissioner of Bangkok Metropolitan Police Bureau, told a news conference.
Police used rubber bullets for the first time last Sunday, as well as tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters. Ten protesters and 26 police were injured.
In a podcast on Saturday morning, the prime minister urged Thais to respect the law and avoid conflict. 
""We have to love each other and be united, not divided, and respect the law,"" said Prayuth, who first came to power after leading a military coup in 2014. 

The Royal Palace has declined to directly comment on the protests, but Prayuth and government officials have said that criticism of the king is unlawful and inappropriate.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast voted on Saturday in a legislative election, with President Alassane Ouattara's allies facing a combined challenge from opposition parties led by two of his predecessors.
The poll comes only months after Ouattara won a third term in an election marred by unrest that killed at least 85 people, the country's worst violence since a 2010-2011 civil war. 
After boycotting the presidential election in October to protest Ouattara's decision to seek a third term, the parties of former presidents Henri Konan Bedie and Laurent Gbagbo are fielding parliamentary candidates on joint lists.
Clear control of parliament by Ouattara's Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace (RHDP) would strengthen his hand to pursue an agenda based on attracting investment to the world's top cocoa producer. 
""The fact that all major parties are participating in this election is a development that confirms the democratic momentum in our country,"" Ouattara said after casting his own ballot. 
Turnout appeared light in the early hours of voting. Polls close at 1800 GMT and final results are due on Sunday.
""We are voting for peace. We don't want any more endless debates between Ivorians,"" said Aïcha Coulibaly, a hairdresser, who wore an RHDP t-shirt as she voted in Abobo, a Ouattara stronghold of the commercial capital Abidjan. 
The opposition is under pressure to show it remains relevant after over a decade of political dominance by Ouattara, who came to power after defeating the incumbent Gbagbo in the 2010 election and then prevailing in the civil war that followed. 
Gbagbo's faction of the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) is participating in a national election for the first time since he was ousted in 2011 and sent to the International Criminal Court to face war crimes charges. He was acquitted in 2019.
""I am happy to participate in this vote. Since 2010, I hadn't voted,"" said retiree Alfred Balli after casting his ballot in Yopougoun, a Gbagbo stronghold of Abidjan. 

Bedie's Democratic Party of Ivory Coast (PDCI) dominated national politics from the 1940s until he was overthrown as president in 1999. It backed Ouattara for years but split with him in 2018.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian farmers began gathering on Saturday to block a six-lane expressway outside New Delhi to mark the 100th day of protests against deregulation of agriculture markets, to add pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. 
Farmers young and old headed in cars, trucks and tractors to the highway for a five-hour roadblock to oppose three farm laws enacted in September 2020 they say hurt them by opening up the agriculture sector to private players.
Modi has called the laws much-needed reforms for the country's vast and antiquated agriculture sector, and painted the protests as politically motivated. 
""The Modi government has turned this protest movement into an ego issue. They are unable to see the pain of the farmers,"" said Amarjeet Singh, a 68-year-old farmer from Punjab state. ""They have left us no option but to protest.""
Tens of thousands of farmers from several north Indian states have been camped out on the outskirts of the capital in bitter cold since December demanding that the laws be repealed.
Their movement has gained international attention and support, including from celebrities such as climate activist Greta Thunberg and U.S. singer Rihanna, but several rounds of negotiations between farmer leaders and the government have failed. 
Modi's government has lashed out at supporters of the protests and stands accused by rights activists of using heavy-handed tactics to curb the protests. 
While the protests have been mostly peaceful, a brief spate of violence on Jan. 26 led to the death of a protestor, and the police have filed criminal charges against eight journalists over alleged misreporting on the events of the day. 
""The Indian authorities' response to protests has focused on discrediting peaceful protesters, harassing critics of the government, and prosecuting those reporting on the events,"" Human Rights Watch said in a statement last month.
As the capital braces for harsh summers and the harvesting season begins, farmers gathering on Saturday said they had no plans to turn back until their demands were met.

""Bitter cold didn't affect our movement, and neither will deathly heat,"" said Raja Singh, a 58-year-old farmer from Punjab state.

UR, Iraq (Reuters) - Pope Francis entered a narrow alleyway in Iraq's holy city of Najaf to hold a historic meeting with the county's top Shi'ite cleric and visited the birthplace of the Prophet Abraham on Saturday to condemn violence in the name of God as ""the greatest blasphemy"".
The back-to-back inter-religious events some 200 km (125 miles) apart, one in a dusty, built-up city and the other in a desert plain, reinforced the main theme of his risky trip to Iraq - that the country has suffered far too much.
""From this place, where faith was born, from the land of our father Abraham, let us affirm that God is merciful and that the greatest blasphemy is to profane his name by hating our brothers and sisters,"" Francis said in Ur, where Abraham was born.
With the desert wind blowing his white cassock, Francis, sitting with Muslim, Christian and Yazidi leaders, spoke within sight of the archaeological dig of the 4,000 year-old city that comprises a pyramid-style Ziggurat, a residential complex, temples and palaces.
Hours earlier in Najaf, Francis met Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, a visit that was a powerful signal for coexistence in a country torn by violence.
The U.S. invasion of 2003 plunged Iraq into years of sectarian conflict. Security has improved since the defeat of Islamic State in 2017, but Iraq continues to be a theatre for global and regional score-settling, especially a bitter U.S.-Iran rivalry that has played out on Iraqi soil.
Sistani, 90, is one of the most influential figures in Shi’ite Islam, both within Iraq and beyond, and their meeting was the first between a pope and such a senior Shi’ite cleric.
After the meeting, Sistani called on world religious leaders to hold great powers to account and for wisdom and sense to prevail over war. He added Christians should live like all Iraqis in peace and coexistence.
In a statement, Sistani said, ""Religious and spiritual leadership must play a big role to put a stop to tragedy ... and urge sides, especially great powers, to make wisdom and sense prevail and erase the language of war"".
Their meeting took place at the humble home Sistani has rented for decades, located near the golden-domed Imam Ali shrine in Najaf. An official Vatican photo showed Sistani in his traditional black Shi'ite robe and turban sitting across from Francis.
A MEETING OF FAITHS
Although Abraham is considered the father of Christians, Muslims and Jews, no Jewish representative was present at the inter-religious event in Ur. 
In 1947, a year before Israel’s birth, Iraq’s Jewish community numbered around 150,000. Now their numbers are in single figures.
A local Church official said Jews were contacted and invited but the situation for them was ""complicated"" particularly as they have no structured community. However, in similar past events in predominantly Muslim countries, a senior foreign Jewish figure has attended.
""Hostility, extremism and violence are not born of a religious heart: they are betrayals of religion,"" the pope said at Ur. ""We believers cannot be silent when terrorism abuses religion; indeed, we are called unambiguously to dispel all misunderstandings,"" he said.
Islamic State militants, who tried to establish a caliphate covering several countries, ravaged northern Iraq from 2014-2017, killing Christians as well as Muslims who opposed the insurgents.
Iraq's Christian community, one of the oldest in the world, has been particularly devastated, falling to about 300,000 from about 1.5 million before the U.S. invasion and the brutal Islamist militant violence that followed.
'A TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE'
At Ur, Francis praised young Muslims for helping Christians repair their churches ""when terrorism invaded the north of this beloved country"".
Rafah Husein Baher, a member of the small, ancient Sabean Mandaean religion, thanked Francis for making the trip despite the many problems in the country, which include a surge in COVID-19 cases and a recent spate of rocket and suicide bomb attacks.
""Your visit means a triumph of virtue, it is a symbol of appreciation to Iraqis, Blessed is he who uproots fear from souls.""
The pope, who began his four-day visit to Iraq in Baghdad on Friday, was expected to say Mass later on Saturday at the capital's Chaldean Cathedral of Saint Joseph.

On Sunday he travels north to Mosul, a former Islamic State stronghold, where churches and other buildings there still bear the scars of conflict.

Sisi was also due to discuss Red Sea security and developments on Sudan's borders during his visit to Khartoum, Egypt's presidency said in a statement.
Sudan faces security challenges including an increase in violence in the western Darfur region and recent armed skirmishes in a disputed area on its border with Ethiopia.
Both Egypt and Sudan lie downstream from the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which Addis Ababa says is crucial to its economic development.
Ethiopia, which says it has every right to use Nile waters long exploited by Egypt, started filling the reservoir behind the dam last summer after Egypt and Sudan failed to secure a legally binding agreement over the hydropower dam's operation.
Khartoum fears the dam, which lies on the Blue Nile close to the border with Sudan, could increase the risk of flooding and affect the safe operation of its own Nile dams, while water-scarce Egypt fears its supplies from the Nile could be hit.
Years of diplomatic talks over the project have repeatedly stalled. 
Sudan recently proposed that the United States, European Union, United Nations and African Union should actively mediate in the dispute, rather than simply observing talks, a suggestion that Egypt supports.
Ethiopia this week indicated its opposition to adding mediators to an existing, African Union-led process. 
In a phone call with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry ""stressed the need to launch a serious and effective negotiation process"" over the dam before a second round of filling expected this summer.

Since Bashir was toppled following mass protests in 2019, a military-civilian council has held power in Sudan under a political transition expected to last until the end of 2023.

The Southeast Asian country has been plunged in turmoil since the military overthrew and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, with daily protests and strikes that have choked business and paralysed administration.
Sporadic protests were staged across Myanmar on Saturday and local media reported that police fired tear gas shells and stun grenades to break up a protest in the Sanchaung district of Yangon, the country's biggest city. There were no reports of casualties.
More than 50 protesters have been killed since the coup, according to the United Nations - at least 38 on Wednesday alone. Protesters demand the release of Suu Kyi and the respect of November's election, which her party won in landslide, but which the army rejected.
""How much more can we allow the Myanmar military to get away with?"" Special Envoy Christine Schraner Burgener told a closed meeting of the 15-member U.N. Security Council on Friday, according to a copy of her remarks reviewed by Reuters.
""It is critical that this council is resolute and coherent in putting the security forces on notice and standing with the people of Myanmar firmly, in support of the clear November election results."" 
A junta spokesman did not answer calls requesting comment.
The army says it has been restrained in stopping the protests, but has said it will not allow them to threaten stability.
Several hundred people gathered in Sydney on Saturday to protest against the coup, singing and holding up three fingers, a salute that has come to symbolise solidarity and resistance across Myanmar.
""We would like to urge the Australian government to work closely with the U.S., UK and EU governments and take strong action against these Myanmar military dictators,"" said protest organiser Thein Moe Win.
In Myanmar's southern town of Dawei, protesters chanted ""Democracy is our cause"" and ""The revolution must prevail"". 
People have taken to Myanmar's streets in their hundreds of thousands at times, vowing to continue action in a country that spent nearly half a century under military rule until democratic reforms in 2011 that were cut short by the coup.
""Political hope has begun to shine. We can't lose the momentum of the revolution,"" one protest leader, Ei Thinzar Maung, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""Those who dare to fight will have victory. We deserve victory.""
GRAVE DISTURBED
On Friday night, authorities disturbed the grave of a 19-year-old woman who became an icon of the protest movement after she was shot dead wearing a T-shirt that read ""Everything will be OK"", a witness and local media said.
One witness said the body of Kyal Sin, widely known as Angel, was removed on Friday, examined and returned, before the tomb was re-sealed in Myanmar's second city of Mandalay. The independent Mizzima news service also reported the event.
A military spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment. Reuters was unable to contact police for comment.
The killing of protesters has drawn international outrage.
""Use of violence against the people of Myanmar must stop now,"" South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in a tweet, calling for the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees and for the restoration of democracy.
The United States and some other Western countries have imposed limited sanctions on the junta and the independent U.N. human rights investigator on Myanmar, Thomas Andrews, has called for a global arms embargo and targeted economic sanctions.
The army took power over allegations of fraud in last year's election which had been dismissed by the electoral commission. It has promised to hold a new election at an unspecified date.
That plan is rejected by protesters and by a group representing lawmakers elected at the last election that has begun to issue statements in the name of a rival civilian administration.
On Friday, it listed four demands - the end of the junta, the release of the detainees, democracy and the abolition of the 2008 constitution which left significant political representation and control in the hands of the military.
A civil disobedience campaign of strikes running parallel with the protests has been supported by many government workers including a trickle of policemen.
Authorities in Myanmar have asked India to return eight policemen who sought refuge across the border to avoid taking orders from the junta, an official in northeast India said on Saturday.

India's foreign ministry responded to a request for comment by referring to a statement given at a media briefing on Friday which said the ministry was still ""ascertaining the facts.""

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said on Saturday, in a bid to push forward peace talks with the Taliban, that his government was ready to discuss holding fresh elections, insisting that any new government should emerge through the democratic process.
""Transfer of power through elections is a non-negotiable principle for us,"" Ghani told lawmakers at the opening of parliament session in Kabul. 
""We stand ready to discuss holding free, fair and inclusive elections under the auspices of international community. We can also talk about the date of the elections and reach a conclusion.
President Ghani met U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad in Kabul during the past week to discuss ways to inject momentum in the stalled peace negotiations with Taliban representatives being held in Qatar. After his talks in Kabul, Khalilzad went to Qatar.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has begun a review of its strategy for Aghanistan, including an agreement reached with the Taliban in early 2020 that paved the way for talks between the insurgents and the Afghan government.
Afghan officials and western diplomats said that during his visit to Kabul Khalilzad had floated the idea of establishing an interim government after bringing Afghan leaders and Taliban leaders together for a multilateral conference outside the country.
But Ghani said the only way to form a government should be through an election.
""I advise those who go to this or that gate to gain power is that political power in Afghanistan has a gate, and the key is the vote of the Afghan people,"" he said.
""Any institution can write a fantasy on a piece of paper and suggest a solution for Afghanistan. These papers have been written in the past and will be written in the future. Our guarantee is our constitution."" 
Elected two years ago, Ghani is not yet midway through his five-year term.

Violence and targeted killings have surged since the Afghan government began U.S.-backed negotiations with the Taliban last September, and western security officials say the insurgents, already holding large swathes of rural areas, have begun to gain ground around towns and cities.

Khan, who became prime minister following the 2018 general elections, volunteered to seek parliament's confidence after the government’s finance minister lost a high-profile Senate seat election earlier in the week. 
Opposition parties boycotted the session, saying the Senate seat defeat was enough to show that Khan no longer enjoyed the confidence of the house, and the vote of confidence was unnecessary.

A military spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment. Reuters was unable to contact police for comment.
State media on Friday questioned reports that the protester had been killed by security forces when they opened fire to disperse a demonstration on Wednesday and said the cause of death was being investigated by ""rule of law bodies"".
Pictures provided to Reuters by a resident who visited the grave on Saturday showed cement that was still drying as well as discarded rubber gloves and boots, surgical gowns and boots. One block appeared to be stained with blood.
A witness who lives near the graveyard said he had seen the grave opened using power tools on Friday evening by a team of at least 30 people that arrived with four cars and two police trucks as well as two trucks of soldiers for security.
""They pulled out the coffin and removed the body and placed it on a bench. They even placed a brick under the head,"" said the witness, who declined to be named for fear of reprisals.
""Those who seemed to be doctors wearing the protective cover did something to the body, I think they were touching the head. They took a small piece from the body and showed it to each other,"" he said.

Two other people told Reuters they were warned by locals not the enter the cemetery on Friday as police and military were inside unearthing Kyal Sin’s body.
Reuters was unable to contact Kyal Sin's family.
Photographs of her body on Wednesday showed a bloody head wound.
The state-run Global New Light Of Myanmar newspaper said on Friday that experts had analysed the photograph and concluded the injury was not consistent with being caused by an anti-riot weapon.
""If it is the injury caused by the riot weapon or live ammunition, it is not possible for the head of the deceased person to be in good condition,"" it said.
""The respective rule of law bodies are investigating the cause of her death and more information will be announced in a timely manner.""
Kyal Sin was among at least 38 people killed on Wednesday, the bloodiest day so far in attempts by security forces to stop protests against the Feb. 1 coup that has prompted daily demonstrations for over a month.
The army says it has been restrained in the use of force, but that it will not allow protests to threaten stability.
The army said it overthrew and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi after the electoral commission rejected its allegations of fraud in an election in November that her party had won by a landslide.

Protesters reject the army's promise of new elections and demand the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Former Mexican President Vicente Fox said on Friday he expected Congress to pass its new law to legalize cannabis next week, a move that would effectively create one of the world's largest weed markets.
The bill, backed by the administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, would mark a major shift in a country bedeviled for years by violence between feuding drug cartels. 
Fox, a director at Colombian-Canadian  Khiron Life  Sciences (OTC:KHRNF) which focuses on cannabis for medical use, has been a long-standing advocate for the decriminalization of marijuana in Mexico.
""We're receiving direct information from the lawmakers,"" he told Reuters. ""It's information that is quite trustworthy and solid, and next week this should be approved.""
A source in the lower house told Reuters the bill would be discussed on Monday. It was due to be approved in December but was delayed.
The bill, which easily passed the Senate in a vote in November, would create a huge new legal market for marijuana which companies like Khiron Life Sciences are eager to tap.
Canada's  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) and The Green Organic Dutchman as well as Medical Marijuana from California are among other firms eyeing Mexico.
Grand View Research said in a recent study the global legal market for the plant could be worth $73.6 billion by 2027.
Lopez Obrador has argued that decriminalizing cannabis and other narcotics could help combat Mexico's powerful drug cartels.
Fox said he wants to create a marijuana greenhouse and a laboratory where the plant will be studied at his Fox Center in Mexico.

""I'm convinced legalization of marijuana is the first step towards the legalization of all prohibited products,"" he said.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - International human rights groups on Friday condemned what they said was the use of ""indiscriminate"" force by police in Argentina´s Formosa province against people protesting tightening restrictions amid a spike in COVID-19 infections.
Local media broadcast images on Friday showing regional police firing rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters in the provincial capital Formosa after authorities moved to close down some businesses to stem the recent increase in cases.
The regional office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the resident coordinator for United Nations Argentina said in a statement they were concerned police had employed ""indiscriminate violence that resulted in people being injured and detained.""
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights said on its Twitter account that it was concerned over reports that ""police officers had used rubber pellets, tear gas and beatings against protesters and journalists.""
President Alberto Fernandez´s chief of staff, Santiago Cafiero, said on Twitter that ""the State must guarantee the free peaceful expression of citizens...violence is never the way.""
Formosa, in northern Argentina, is one of the poorest provinces in the South American country and has been hard hit by a recession made worse by the coronavirus crisis. Argentina, a top global grains producer, has reported 2.14 million cases of COVID-19 since March 2020, and more than 52,784 deaths from the disease.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's government has walled off the presidential palace with a metallic barrier ahead of a planned women's march on Monday to protest rampant violence against women and the president's support for a gubernatorial candidate accused of rape.
Barriers were also installed around other emblematic buildings and monuments in downtown Mexico City where a year ago tens of thousands of people marched on International Women's Day, the vast majority peacefully.
""It is outrageous, few people support us in the cry for justice,"" said Becky Bios, who survived an attempted femicide -- a term for gender-driven killing -- in 2015 and will participate in the march.
Last year's march, however, was punctuated by clashes between marchers and apparent Nazi sympathizers that left dozens injured, with activists tossing Molotov cocktails at the National Palace and some buildings and cars vandalized.
""The fact that they're barricading the city shows they're aware that women have been listening to them, we have been watching them and apparently now they're the ones who are scared,"" said Arussi Unda, spokeswoman for the feminist collective Las Brujas del Mar, or Witches of the Sea. 
Arussi said violence against women goes unpunished too often, leading to a pattern of revictimization. She believed the gubernatorial candidacy of Felix Salgado, who has been accused of rape, for the southern state of Guerrero is one example of that impunity.
A representative for Salgado, who has not been convicted, did not reply to requests for comment; media reported he has denied the allegations. 
The accusation is based on a case a woman filed with prosecutors in Guerrero at the end of 2016, according to magazine Proceso. 
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said that those calling on him to drop support for Salgado, a member of the ruling Morena party, are politically motivated.
In a country where femicides rose nearly 130% between 2015 and 2020, critics said the decision to erect 10-foot (3-meter) barriers around the National Palace is symptomatic of Lopez Obrador's apathy toward the crisis of violence afflicting women. 
At least 939 women were victims of femicide last year in Mexico, according to official data.

""Mexico beautiful and beloved. Where the daughters come back in pieces. Where drug traffickers receive hugs and feminists are shot. Where rapists are governors. Where the National Palace is walled in order not to listen,"" said Twitter user @analuzsaso.

ASUNCION (Reuters) - Protesters clashed with police in Paraguay´s capital, Asuncion, late on Friday as anger over the government´s handling of the coronavirus crisis boiled onto the streets and forced the resignation of the country´s top health official.
Security forces fired rubber bullets and tear gas on hundreds of rioters who gathered around the Congress building in downtown Asuncion, while protesters broke down security barriers, burned road barricades and threw stones at police. 
The riots, which turned the capital's historic center into a make-shift battlefield of fire, smoke and gunshots, broke out amid growing outrage as coronavirus infections hit record levels and hospitals verged on collapse throughout the South American nation. 
""It is a pity that young people have taken this too far. They are people who seek only to destroy,"" Interior Minister Arnaldo Giuzzio told the Telefuturo television channel. ""This violence does not make sense.""
Earlier on Friday, health minister Julio Mazzoleni resigned, a day after lawmakers called for his ouster. 
Mazzoleni is the latest of several top health officials across Latin America forced from their jobs in recent weeks amid increasing anger over the handling of the pandemic and slow rollout of vaccinations.
Mazzoleni initially rebuked the Senate's non-binding declaration asking him to leave, but hours later conceded following a meeting with President Mario Abdo.
Abdo appointed Dr. Julio Borba, a vice minister, to take Mazzoleni's place. Borba told reporters he would begin tracking down medicine and supplies immediately.
Paraguay is posting record numbers of cases daily, according to a Reuters tally, with 115 infections per 100,000 people reported in the last seven days. 

The country has vaccinated less than 0.1% of its population, the data shows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. border agents detained nearly 100,000 migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in February, according to two people familiar with preliminary figures, the highest monthly total since a major border surge in mid-2019. 
The figures, which have not been previously reported, show the scope of a growing migrant influx at the southwest border as U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, seeks to roll back some of the restrictive policies of former President Donald Trump, a Republican. February was Biden's first full month in office.
Last month's total would represent the highest tally for the month of February since 2006. The sources who provided the figures to Reuters spoke on the condition of anonymity.
An increasing number of children arriving at the border without a parent or legal guardian has forced U.S. officials in recent weeks to scramble for housing options and take steps to speed up their release to sponsors in the United States.
The nearly 100,000 migrants detained at the border in February represent an increase over a figure of 78,000 in January. February's total appears to be the highest monthly number since June 2019 during a large border surge that Trump cited as justification for a broad immigration crackdown.
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman said official statistics for last month likely will be released next week.
U.S. Border Patrol agents caught more than 4,500 migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in a single day on Wednesday, according to government figures shared with Reuters, a sign that illegal entries could continue to rise in March.
Republicans have criticized Biden for rolling back Trump's hardline immigration policies, saying the shift will lead to more illegal immigration.
Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House of Representatives, sent a letter to Biden on Friday that requested a meeting to discuss the issue, saying he had ""great concern"" with the administration's approach to border. 
""We must acknowledge the border crisis, develop a plan, and, in no uncertain terms, strongly discourage individuals from Mexico and Central America from ever making the dangerous journey to our southern border,"" McCarthy wrote in the letter.
The recidivism rate among migrants attempting to cross the border illegally increased over the past year under a Trump-era policy known as Title 42. That policy, issued on public health grounds amid the coronavirus pandemic, allowed U.S. authorities to rapidly expel migrants caught crossing. In some cases, migrants attempt to cross the border again.

Biden exempted unaccompanied children from the policy in February.

Earlier on Friday, Beijing proposed legislation that would tighten its increasingly authoritarian grip on Hong Kong by making changes to the electoral committee that chooses the city's leader, giving it new power to nominate legislative candidates. 
The measure, set to be approved during a week-long session of China's rubber-stamp parliament, would further marginalize a democratic opposition decimated after Beijing imposed national security legislation following anti-government protests that rocked Hong Kong in 2019.
The United States condemns China's ""continuing assault on democratic institutions in Hong Kong,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price told a regular news briefing.
Price called Beijing's moves ""a direct attack on Hong Kong's autonomy ... freedoms and the democratic processes.""
""If implemented these measures would drastically undermine Hong Kong democratic institutions,"" he said.
Price said Washington was working to rally allies and partners to speak with one voice in condemning China's abuses against minority Muslims in Xinjiang and the ""repression"" taking place in Hong Kong.
""I don't think anyone is satisfied yet, with the international response to what has taken place in Xinjiang. And that's precisely why we are, in many ways, galvanizing the world, galvanizing collective action, to make clear that these sort of abuses against human rights in Xinjiang and elsewhere will not be tolerated,"" he said.

The Biden administration, which took office in January, has endorsed a determination by the former Trump administration that China is committing genocide in Xinjiang and said that the United States must be prepared to impose costs on Beijing for its actions there, its crackdown in Hong Kong and threats towards Taiwan.

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - The Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that a lower court must reconsider a third-degree murder charge against Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who is due to go on trial next week for the death of George Floyd last May.
Chauvin's trial was due to begin with jury selection in Minneapolis on Monday but that could be delayed as Judge Peter Cahill of the Hennepin County district court must now weigh again reinstating the third-degree murder charge.
Chauvin already faces a more serious charge of second-degree murder, which carries a sentence of up to 40 years in prison, as well as a charge of second-degree manslaughter. State prosecutors want the jury to also be able to consider a third-degree murder charge, which carries a sentence of up to 25 years in prison.
Videos show Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes on a sidewalk outside a grocery store on May 25 as he pleaded for his life and then stopped moving. Police were arresting him on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at the store.
The death of Floyd, a Black man, outraged people around the world and helped fuel one of the largest protest movements ever seen in the United States, with daily demonstrations against police brutality and racism.
Lawyers for Chauvin, 44, have told the court they intend to argue that he acted appropriately according to his duties and training as a police officer. 
State prosecutors had originally included the third-degree murder charge against Chauvin, under a statute with a complex recent legal history.
Lawyers for Chauvin had successfully argued it should be dropped on the basis that the statute requires the ""death-causing act"" not be directed at a single individual. It is often used in instances where someone uses deadly force against a crowd of people, for example.
But the Minnesota Court of Appeals recently ruled in a separate case that third-degree murder could be applied even if the ""death-causing act"" is directed at a specific person, and ruled on Friday that this precedent binds the district court.
In its order, the appeals court said Cahill could still consider any additional arguments offered by Chauvin's lawyers for having the third-degree murder charge dropped. His lead attorney, who could also appeal the ruling to the Minnesota Supreme Court, did not respond to a request for comment.
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison welcomed the appeals court ruling in a statement, saying it ""reflects the gravity of the allegations against Mr. Chauvin.""

Three other police officers at the scene face charges of aiding and abetting the murder of Floyd in a separate trial due to start later this year. All four police officers were fired after Floyd's death.

Parts of the destroyed drones fell and injured a 10-year-old boy and also a man who was driving near the Saudi city of Khamis Mushait, Saudi civil defence said.
The Iran-aligned Houthis have stepped up cross-border drone and missile attacks on Saudi cities recently, mostly targeting the southern part of the country. The coalition says it intercepts most attacks.
The Houthis fired the six intercepted drones towards Khamis Mushait near the Yemen border in attacks since dawn, the coalition said in statements carried by Saudi state news agency SPA and Ekhbariya TV. 
Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in Twitter posts on Friday that three drones had been fired at dawn, and five in the afternoon. They hit Abha International Airport and King Khalid Air Base, in the Khamis Mushait area, he said. 
Yemen's Houthi forces said on Thursday they fired a missile and hit a  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) facility in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. There has been no confirmation from the Saudi authorities.
The United States and United Nations have renewed peace efforts as fighting has also intensified in Yemen's gas-rich Marib region.

Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro had developed a close alignment with former U.S. President Donald Trump and shared his disdain for climate change issues and international accords.
But that has changed now, according to Araujo, speaking remotely to the Council of the Americas hemispheric business forum.
""Something that was regarded as an impediment... is totally out of the way. We are now working together... as key partners towards a successful COP26 and fully implementing climate agreements,"" Araujo said, referring to the COP26 United Nations climate summit scheduled for later this year.
Araujo said he and Brazilian Environment Minister Ricardo Salles had talked with President Joe Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry, and his team. He said there were no ""philosophical differences,"" only differences in approach.
Araujo had previously been seen as a climate skeptic, who had called theories of human-induced climate change a ""Marxist conspiracy.""
He acknowledged there was illegal deforestation occurring in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which he said the government was combating.
""The readiness to cooperate on deforestation is totally there,"" he said, adding that the United States was open to ""sustainable investment"" in the Amazon.
Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest hit a 12-year high in 2020, when an area seven times the size of London was cut down, according to government space research agency INPE. 
That followed on a major jump in deforestation in 2019, when Bolsonaro took office and moved to weaken environmental enforcement, which he has criticized as overzealous.

Araujo said Brasilia was looking to forge an alliance with the United States based on the values of ""democracy and prosperity,"" with Brazil needing U.S. investment to transform itself into a modern market economy.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean authorities have warned citizens to keep protecting themselves from the coronavirus despite the country's highly successful vaccination programme amid fears that the end of the Southern Hemisphere summer and return to work and school could bring a fresh spike in cases. 
Chile's top public health official, Paula Daza, told Reuters in an interview that despite almost 26% of the population now having received a vaccine dose, Chileans should not lower their guard just yet. 
""Chile has a vaccination strategy under way that is very solid and has reached all corners of our territory and that is very good news,"" she said. 
""You have to strike a balance, to give people hope because it has been a hard year for everyone ... but we also have to keep warning of the risks.""
Chile ranks sixth in the world for per-capita vaccine shots administered according to Reuters data, with just shy of 4 million people now having received at least one dose of the two-dose vaccines developed by pharmaceutical firms Pfizer/BioNTech and Sinovac Biotech Ltd.
But on Friday, daily confirmed cases of the virus in Chile hit their highest rate in eight months at 5,325, bringing warnings from authorities of potential fresh quarantines. 
Daza said fatigue with lengthy restrictions on movement and strict sanitary measures coupled with the end of the Southern Hemisphere summer holiday meant cases ticking up since November could now spike. 
She said informal health ministry polls around vaccination centres and in shopping precincts indicated people viewed the arrival of vaccines as the end of their ordeal. 
""We ask people why they are getting vaccinated and they say: 'With the vaccine all this is going to end, I will have more freedom,'"" she said. 

""But you can have an increase in the number of cases at the same time as you advance with vaccinations. We are telling people to watch out, we are still in a pandemic.""

YAUARETÊ, Brazil (Reuters) - An army helicopter flew to two isolated indigenous villages in Brazil's Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) jungle this week with a welcome cargo - coronavirus vaccines. 
The Hupda communities lined up to get their shots.
Traditional medicine prescribed by a shaman is highly respected here, but there was no resistance to receiving the vaccine by China's Sinovac Biotech.
""We are grateful for the vaccination, so we will not catch the disease,"" said Hupda chieftain Jorge Pires in the village of Santo Antanasio, near the Colombian border and a 25-minute helicopter flight from the nearest military outpost.
Following criticism by indigenous leaders that echoed internationally last year that their vulnerable communities were being ""decimated"" by COVID-19, Brazil's Health and Defense ministries have mounted a vaccination campaign reaching remote reservations and villages.
So far 265,244 indigenous people have had a first dose, and 124,063 the second dose, of 400,000 covered by the ministry's indigenous health service Sesai.
According to the service, 50,000 indigenous people have been infected and 589 have died from COVID-19.
That does not include half of Brazil's 800,000 plus indigenous population not covered by Sesai because they have moved off traditional lands and reservations.
Brazil is battling a COVID-19 outbreak that is worsening, with record deaths reported in the last three days, reaching 1,910 dead in 24 hours on Wednesday. So far, 260,000 people have died and 10.8 million infected, the second-deadliest after the United States.
In the second village of Taracuá Igarapé, there have been no cases of COVID-19 thanks to its isolation, but preventing coronavirus from taking hold is paramount to protecting indigenous communities that live under one roof and cannot practice social distancing.
The challenge of reaching 20,000 indigenous people living in a jungle area the size of Portugal is enormous, and requires helicopter travel, because travel by meandering rivers takes days, said Army Colonel Sylvio Doktorczyk.
""When we talk about Amazonia, everything is superlative, including the difficulties! Particularly the great distances and long rivers,"" the colonel heading the mission said.
It was a return visit to the two villages to inoculate those that missed the first dose because they were out hunting or fishing, and to gives other their second shot of CoronaVac.

""My people liked to have the vaccine. My community like the vaccine and like when medical people come here,"" said Jovino Pinoa, after getting his second shot.

Security Council urged to act as Myanmar protesters are again met with gunfire,"(Reuters) - Police in Myanmar on Friday opened fire on protesters against last month's military coup, killing one man, as international condemnation rained down on the junta and the U.N. special envoy on Myanmar urged the Security Council to act.
Christine Burgener called on the council for ""unified support, action"", asking ""how much more can we allow the Myanmar military to get away with?"", following the deaths of dozens of civilian protesters this week.
She said the situation in Myanmar was moving toward ""an acute humanitarian crisis"".
Activists demanding the restoration of the elected government of veteran democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi held more demonstrations in several towns and cities, with thousands marching peacefully through the second city of Mandalay.
""The stone age is over, we're not scared because you threaten us,"" the crowd chanted.
Police opened fire and one man was killed, witnesses and a doctor told Reuters by telephone.
An official from Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) was also stabbed to death along with his 17-year-old nephew in an apparent mob attack in the central Magwe region, local media reported.
Myanmar Now cited the son of the official, who survived the attack, as saying 25 supporters of the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party set upon them with knives. 
The party did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In the main city of Yangon, police fired rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse protesters who had been joined by about 100 doctors in white coats, witnesses said.
Crowds also gathered in Pathein, to the west of Yangon, and in central Myingyan, where dozens of women in straw hats held up signs calling for Suu Kyi's release, witnesses said.
A spokesman for the ruling military council did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.
Thousands also rallied in the southeastern Karen state, accompanied by fighters from the Karen National Union (KNU), an ethnic armed group engaged in a long-running war with the military.
During the rally - the strongest indication yet of support for the anti-coup movement from one of the country's myriad ethnic armed groups - KNU troops flashed the three-finger salute popularized by protesters and handed out water bottles.
The KNU said in a statement it would not tolerate attacks on peaceful protesters by the army.
""People in urban areas, ethnic armed groups and the international community must work together until the military dictatorship falls,"" it said.
On Thursday, police broke up rallies with tear gas and gunfire in several cities but the crackdown was more restrained than on Wednesday, when the United Nations said 38 people were killed in the bloodiest day of protests.
In all, at least 55 people have been killed since the Feb. 1 coup.
U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet demanded the security forces halt what she called their ""vicious crackdown on peaceful protesters"". Bachelet said more than 1,700 people had been arrested, including 29 journalists.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said some Red Cross volunteers had been injured and wrongfully arrested and Red Cross ambulances had been damaged.
The military seized power saying that the NLD's landslide victory in an election in November was fraudulent. The electoral commission has said the ballot was fair.
The junta has promised new elections but not given a date. Activists have rejected that and demand the release of Suu Kyi, who has been in detention since the coup.
DISOBEDIENCE
Singapore has been the most outspoken of Myanmar's neighbours and its foreign minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, said it was a ""national shame"" for armed forces to use weapons against their people.
But condemnation of the coup and subsequent violence has come largely from the West, with Asian nations, including India, mostly more restrained. The junta can count on some support from Russia and China - a major investor - at the United Nations.
The military has weathered isolation and sanctions during previous eras of army rule and has indicated it will not be swayed this time around.
The U.N. human rights investigator on Myanmar, Thomas Andrews, urged the Security Council to impose a global arms embargo and targeted economic sanctions on the junta. 
The United States has told China, which has declined to condemn the coup, that it expects it to play a constructive role. China has said stability is a top priority. 
The military, which ruled directly for nearly 50 years until it embarked on a tentative transition to democracy a decade ago, has been struggling to impose its authority on a country where many people abhor the thought of a return of army rule.
A civil disobedience campaign of strikes running parallel with the protests has been supported by many government workers including a trickle of policemen. 
Indian security forces meanwhile stepped up border patrols to stop any more people entering, Indian officials said. About 20 policemen crossed into India this week fearing persecution for disobeying orders to enforce the crackdown.
""As of now, we are not letting anybody enter,"" Maria Zuali, a government official in Mizoram state, told Reuters.
The move follows the defection over the border of some low-ranking Myanmar police officers who were unwilling to obey orders to suppress demonstrations.
More than 10 Myanmar diplomats in foreign missions have also declared their support for the pro-democracy campaign, the Irrawaddy news outlet reported. In Washington, it was unclear whether Myanmar's embassy was still representing the junta.

In New York, a clash over who represents Myanmar at the United Nations was averted after the junta's replacement quit and the Myanmar U.N. mission confirmed that Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun remained in the job.The junta fired Kyaw Moe Tun on Saturday after he urged countries at the U.N. General Assembly to use ""any means necessary"" to reverse the coup.

JACKSON, Miss. (Reuters) - Officials in Mississippi's largest city, Jackson, are aiming to have running water largely restored by the weekend, nearly three weeks after devastating winter weather left tens of thousands of residents without service.
The city on Friday was again distributing non-potable water at four sites so people can flush their toilets, and residents must still boil any faucet water before using it for food preparation, drinking, washing dishes or brushing teeth.
Charles Williams (NYSE:WMB), the city's public works director, said on Thursday that workers should soon be able to sample enough water to lift the boil advisory.
""I see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" Williams said at a news conference, sounding more optimistic than he did on Wednesday, when problems at the city's treatment plant caused pressure to drop across the entire system. At that time, he estimated around a quarter of Jackson's 43,000 water connections - most of which serve multiple households - were not operating.
Officials did not have an updated estimate as of Friday, though city spokeswoman Michelle Atoa said the system maintained pressure overnight.
Tamiko Smith, 53, spent several anxiety-filled days scrambling to find clean water to perform the at-home dialysis treatments her husband, Otis, requires four days a week.
She tracked down some packaged water at a dialysis training center. Her husband's uncle, however, who comes to Jackson to receive his own dialysis at a clinic, went three days without treatment because the facility had no access to water.
""It was very stressful,"" said Smith, who compared the situation to living in a ""third-world country.""
The problems stem from the same cold snap that wreaked havoc in Texas last month, shutting down the state's power grid and leaving millions without heat in sub-freezing temperatures.
Jackson, the state capital with a population of more than 160,000 people, has seen more than 100 water main leaks since the storm and has been repairing them as quickly as possible, officials said. 
The city's mayor, Chokwe Lumumba, sent a letter to Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves earlier this week requesting $47 million in emergency funding to repair and improve Jackson's water system.
Resident Jennifer Cattenhead, 39, and her three children finally had water service return on Thursday after more than two weeks without it.
""I was like, 'Oh Lord,'"" she said with relief.
Cattenhead had driven miles to find stores with jugs of water in stock, and she melted ice to use for flushing toilets. The first week after the storm, her house also had no power or heat, forcing her family to sleep in their cars for warmth.
The crisis has also shuttered businesses across the city. Jeff Good, the co-owner of three restaurants, said his pizzeria, Sal & Mookie's New York Pizza & Ice Cream Joint, would open on Friday for the first time since Feb. 17 after getting water restored on Thursday.

Workers at his Broad Street Bakery & Café, meanwhile, were spending all day on Friday baking after the water returned ahead of reopening on Saturday morning.

    ""It's really important to have women doing production so younger women can aspire to be and see that you can achieve and do well in this side of the industry,"" said Melle Brown, a music producer, DJ and radio host from London. 
    Garvey, 45, has been at the helm of the world's oldest recording studio since 2014. Following what she describes as a ""deep, dark history in finance"", she carved herself a career in music, rising to senior roles at major music labels.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government is evaluating whether to house unaccompanied migrant children at a military base in Virginia amid a sharp rise in migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) notice seen by Reuters.
A Pentagon spokesman confirmed that Fort Lee, a U.S. Army facility about 30 miles (48 km) south of Richmond, was under consideration.
The number of migrant children arriving at the southwestern border has increased in recent months, putting pressure on HHS-run shelters that house the children before they are released to parents or other sponsors in the United States.
In the notice, HHS said it urgently needs to find more shelter space for unaccompanied minors. The department said it must ""aggressively"" find solutions for the rising number of children entering the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The number of migrants caught crossing the border and allowed to enter the United States has increased in recent weeks, as U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has pledged to reverse many of the hardline policies of former President Donald Trump, a Republican.
U.S. officials are hurrying to find housing and speed up releases of a growing number of unaccompanied children arriving at the border after Biden exempted them in February from a Trump-era policy known as Title 42. That policy, issued on COVID-19-related public health grounds, allows U.S. authorities to rapidly expel migrants caught at the border.
Under U.S. law, children under the age of 18 caught crossing the border without a parent or legal guardian are labeled ""unaccompanied"" and must be transferred from Border Patrol facilities to HHS shelters within 72 hours. 
The law outlines separate procedures for children from Mexico and Canada that allow them to be more easily removed from the country.
Most children arriving without a parent or legal guardian are from Mexico and Central America. 
The United States has used military bases to house unaccompanied children during previous spikes in arrivals, including during a surge of unaccompanied minors in 2014 under former President Barack Obama.
The Biden administration also plans to convert two family detention centers in Texas into facilities that would quickly process incoming migrant families and allow them to be released within 72 hours pending the outcome of their cases, according to two people familiar with the plan. 
HHS said that as of March 4 the agency had 7,700 unaccompanied minors in custody, the highest level since 2019. As of last week, it had roughly 7,700 beds available.
Unaccompanied children come to the United States to reunite with family members or escape violence and poverty in their home countries, according to experts. In some cases, children arrive at the border with an adult, such as a relative or family friend, but are deemed ""unaccompanied"" because they are traveling without a parent or legal guardian.

""As Iran's FM (foreign minister) & chief nuclear negotiator, I will shortly present our constructive concrete plan of action - through proper diplomatic channels,"" Zarif said on Twitter.
A French diplomatic source and another European source said on Thursday that Iran had given encouraging signs in recent days about opening the informal talks after European powers scrapped plans to criticise Tehran at the U.N. nuclear watchdog.
Iran has so far refused to take part in a meeting brokered by the European Union between world powers and the United States on reviving its 2015 nuclear deal. 
Iran's nuclear policy is decided by the country's top authority, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and not the president or the government.
Tehran and Washington have emerged from former U.S. President Donald Trump's attempts to wreck Iran's nuclear deal locked in a standoff over who should move first to save it. Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018.

Britain, France and Germany decided to pause the submission of a resolution critical of Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency on Thursday to not harm the prospects for diplomacy after what they said were concessions gained from Iran to deal with outstanding nuclear.

The demonstrations mark a resumption of the street protest movement, calling for the old political establishment to depart and the army to quit politics, that suspended its weekly marches a year ago because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Police have not stopped the protests but maintain a heavy street presence and the spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said there was reliable information that hundreds had been arrested around the country.
The mass street protests erupted in 2019, prompting the military to oust veteran President Abdulaziz Bouteflika, and continued weekly until the global pandemic reached Algeria a year ago. 
""Thieves, you have destroyed the country,"" the protesters chanted in central Algiers. 
""This peaceful revolution will continue until we fully achieve our goals,"" said Mohamed Meriche, 33, a school teacher. 
President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, elected in 2019 in a vote that many protesters regarded as a charade, has hailed the movement as providing national renewal, but demonstrators see his government as a continuation of previous administrations.

""There have been numerous instances across the country where security forces have used unnecessary or excessive force and arbitrary arrests to suppress peaceful demonstrations,"" the spokesperson for the U.N. rights commissioner said on Friday.

The EU executive aims to present its plans for a ""digital green pass"" on March 17 and to cooperate with international organisations to ensure that its system also works beyond the European Union.
A system to provide travellers with ""vaccination passports"" is eagerly awaited by airlines and tourism destinations that have been hammered by the pandemic and want to stage a rebound in the peak summer season.
Such passports, pushed by tourism-reliant southern states like Greece and Spain, would provide proof that a person has been vaccinated, test results for those not yet vaccinated and information on recovery for people who have contracted COVID-19.
""The foundation of such a common approach is trust,"" von der Leyen wrote in a letter to EU governments, adding that member states had to start work immediately to ensure systems were ready in time.
As well as a legal framework, the system requires a common technical infrastructure to ensure that authorities in one member state could be sure that certificates issued by another state were reliable, she said.
The Commission is working with member states on a digital infrastructure to allow the certificates to be authenticated and this work could be completed within three months, von der Leyen wrote.
""An EU system can only work if the national systems are in place on time,"" she added.

Sweden said on Friday that it aimed to have it its system up and running by summer and that it would be available on smartphones, digital wallets as well as on paper. It will be based on electronic ID, a system most Swedes already have, and use an encryption key so certificates can be verified at border crossings.

Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, was jailed for two and a half years last month over alleged parole violations related to an embezzlement case he said was trumped up for political reasons, something the authorities deny. 
Prigozhin's company, Konkord, said the court told Navalny to pay damages for comments he made that were deemed defamatory, inaccurate and offensive. It did not elaborate on what those comments were. 
Konkord said in December that Prigozhin had filed lawsuits against Navalny and his allies worth a total of 77 million roubles, the Interfax news agency reported. 
The Kremlin's critics have cast those lawsuits as well as the jailing of Navalny and prosecution of some of his allies as part of a coordinated campaign to cripple their activities. Russian authorities deny those charges.
Navalny surfaced in a jail in Russia's Vladimir region to the east of Moscow, his allies said this week.

Prigozhin has been accused by the United States of election meddling and has been sanctioned by the U.S. and European Union.

1126,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 09:46AM ET</span>",Pope urges Iraqis to shun past violence and give peace a chance,"By Philip Pullella and John Davison
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Pope Francis, making the first trip by a pontiff to Iraq, made an impassioned call on Friday for an end to the militant violence, fratricide and religious strife that has plagued the country for decades, saying peacemakers should finally be given a chance.
""May the clash of arms be silenced ... may there be an end to acts of violence and extremism,"" he said, addressing Iraqi President Barham Salih, politicians and diplomats at the presidential palace.
Francis arrived at Baghdad airport under tight security, after telling reporters on his plane that he felt duty-bound to make the ""emblematic"" trip because the country ""has been martyred for so many years"".
Hundreds of people gathered in small clusters to see him being driven into Baghdad in bulletproof BMW, a departure for a pope who normally insists on using small, normal cars.
A motorcade of dozens of vehicles accompanied him out of the airport compound, which recently came under rocket fire from militia groups.
Most of the people along the roads and even some in the presidential palace did not wear masks, despite the risk of coronavirus. 
As Francis and the president walked together, the 84-year-old pope limped noticeably, indicating that his sciatica may have flared up again. The condition forced him to cancel several events earlier this year.
In his speech at the palace, Francis criticized factional and foreign interests that have destabilised Iraq and the wider region and hit ordinary people the hardest.
""Iraq has suffered the disastrous effects of wars, the scourge of terrorism and sectarian conflicts often grounded in a fundamentalism incapable of accepting the peaceful coexistence of different ethnic and religious groups,"" Francis said.
Iraq's security has improved since the defeat of Islamic State in 2017, but the country continues to be a theatre for global and regional score-settling, especially a bitter U.S.-Iran rivalry that has played out on Iraqi soil.
The U.S. invasion of 2003, after years of international sanctions and a devastating war with Iran instigated by former leader Saddam Hussein in the 1980s, plunged Iraq into sectarian conflict and chronic mismanagement that has plagued it since.
SUICIDE BOMBERS, ROCKET ATTACKS
The decades of conflict and corrupt governance has left Iraq with a vulnerable oil-based economy and an inability to provide basic services to its 40 million people. Mass protests broke out against Iraq's ruling elite in 2019, and a violent crackdown by security forces and militias killed more than 500 people. 
The country has deployed thousands of additional security personnel to protect the pope during the visit, which comes after a spate of rocket and suicide bomb attacks.
Francis told reporters on the plane that he was ""happy to be making trips again"" after 16 months of being unable to make foreign trips because of the coronavirus.
""This visit is one of a kind. We are excited, and we all need this visit, all Iraqis do,"" said an Iraqi Christian from Baghdad, Magin Derius.
WHIRLWIND TOUR
The pope's whirlwind tour will take him by plane, helicopter and cars to four cities, including areas that most foreign dignitaries are unable to reach, let alone in such a short space of time.
He will say Mass at a Baghdad church, meet Iraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric in the southern city of Najaf and travel north to Mosul, where the army had to empty the streets for security reasons last year for a visit by Iraq's prime minister.
Mosul is a former stronghold of Islamic State, and churches and other buildings there still bear the scars of conflict.
Since the defeat of the Islamic State militants in 2017, Iraq has seen a greater degree of security, though violence persists, often in the form of rocket attacks by Iran-aligned militias on U.S. targets, and U.S. military action in response.
Islamic State remains a threat. In January, a suicide attack claimed by the Sunni militant group killed 32 people in Baghdad's deadliest such attack for years.

The pontiff will also visit Ur, birthplace of the prophet Abraham, who is revered by Christians, Muslims and Jews, and meet Iraq's revered top Shi'ite Muslim cleric, 90-year-old Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.

GENEVA (Reuters) - More than a quarter of lawmakers worldwide are women after the proportion inched higher in 2020, but progress is so slow that it will take 50 years at the present rate before they achieve parity with men, a global body of legislatures said on Friday.
""Although progress has been steady over the past few years, it is still excruciatingly slow,"" the Inter-Parliamentary Union, made up of 179 national member parliaments and 13 regional parliaments, said in an annual 'Women in Parliament' report.
""At the current rate, it will take another 50 years before gender parity is achieved in parliaments worldwide,"" the Geneva-based IPU said.
Women made up 25.5 percent of parliamentarians in 2020, up 0.6 percentage points from 2019. In 1995 the portion of women was just 11.3 percent.
Only three countries have as many women in their legislatures as men: Cuba, Rwanda and the United Arab Emirates. Some countries including, Papau New Guinea, Micronesia and Vanuatu, have no women in parliament at all.
IPU secretary-general Martin Chungong said quotas were important to make more headway.
""We have seen in 2020 again confirmation of the fact that quotas, when legislated, well-designed and ambitious, have the potential to drive up women's political and parliamentary representation,"" he told journalists.
He hailed progress in places such as the United States, where women now hold 26.9 percent of seats in the two house of Congress, a record high. But other countries were backsliding, including Jordan and Burkina Faso, he said.

Overall, the Americas had the highest portion of women in parliaments with 32.4 percent. The Middle East and North Africa had the lowest with 17.8 percent.

1128,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 08:40AM ET</span>",Analysis: End of the road for Hong Kong's democratic dream as China 'improves' its voting system,"By James Pomfret
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ever since Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997, opposition activists have tried to bring full democracy to the city, believing that China would live up to its promise to one day allow universal suffrage to elect the city's leader.
On Friday, that campaign was dealt its biggest blow. Chinese parliamentarians in Beijing unveiled details of a plan to revamp the political structure of China's freest city that critics say has all but killed off the pledge of one person, one vote.
China's move comes months after a sweeping national security law was imposed on the Asian financial hub, cracking down on dissent, and more than a year after months of sometimes violent anti-China, pro-democracy protests which swept the city.
""There is not much we can do to effectively change what they're deciding,"" the head of the Democratic Party, Lo Kin-hei, told Reuters.
The structural changes will include increasing the city's legislative seats from 70 to 90, with some of these to now be decided by a committee stacked with Beijing loyalists. Seats likely to be controlled by the democrats will either be scrapped or reduced.
A 1,200-person committee that picks Hong Kong's leader will be expanded - further ""improving"" a system controlled by Chinese ""patriots"", according to Wang Chen, a vice chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress.
Wang told reporters the moves, that would involve re-drafting parts of Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, would consolidate China's ""overall jurisdiction"" over the city and fix ""deep-seated problems"" once and for all.
It was in the Basic Law that Beijing promised universal suffrage as an ultimate goal for Hong Kong.
But Friday's moves now stand to nip in the bud the risk of any resurgence of the democracy movement, founded after Beijing's violent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in and around Tiananmen Square in 1989.
With many leading democrats now jailed or forced into exile, including Lo's predecessor, Wu Chi-wai, who was denied bail this week along with dozens of others for an alleged conspiracy to ""overthrow"" the government, the democrats will try to utilise their grassroots networks to keep their ideals alive.
""The trust towards the system is fading ... and it's not a good sign if we want a more peaceful society to not allow different voices to be in harmony,"" Lo told Reuters.
'MOVING BACKWARDS'
Another veteran democracy campaigner said Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who became head of the Communist Party in 2012, had changed the trajectory of Hong Kong's moves towards full democracy, going against the oft-cited promise of China's late leader, Deng Xiaoping, to let Hong Kong people ""rule"" Hong Kong.
""It's a great tragedy,"" said the source, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the political atmosphere. ""They are moving backwards, not forwards, and taking us back in time to a dark, dark place."" 
With the opposition now likely to be become a permanent minority in a re-modelled legislature, the shift towards China's one-party model will create openings for new patriotic factions, critics and some pro-Beijing politicians say. 
China, given its rise into a global superpower, now has the power and resources to extend its autocratic governance despite criticism and sanctions from the West.
Some see Hong Kong's British Common Law legal system as the last bastion against China's tightening authoritarian grip.
More than 50 democratic advocates crammed into a court in the city this week, some of whom face potential life imprisonment on a subversion charge under the national security law promulgated directly by China's parliament last June. 
Two democrats, veteran activist Leung Kwok-hung and former law professor Benny Tai, had to shuttle between two court rooms for concurrent hearings, while others were taken to hospital after falling ill during marathon sessions. 
Under the security law, the onus rests on defendants to argue a case for bail - which critics say overturns the common law tradition.
Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, which guaranteed its way of life, freedoms and independent legal system.
Barrister Martin Lee, 82, dubbed the city's father of democracy, wrote in a 2014 editorial in the New York Times that universal suffrage was the only way to honour Deng's ""one country, two systems"" formula and to ""keep his blueprint from becoming a litany of broken promises"".
The current moves could be a final departure from that.
""This is now an over-correction,"" a senior Western diplomat told Reuters. 

""In trying to wrest control back, there is a danger that they will overdo it and kill the goose that lays the golden egg.""

Iran is investigating an incident in which at least two Iranians were shot dead this week at the border with Pakistan, and Islamabad has handed over the body of one of the victims, the Iranian foreign ministry said a week ago.
The shooting of people carrying fuel across the border led to protests that spread from the city of Saravan to other areas in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan, including the capital, Zahedan.
""The series of violent events and unrest began on 22 February, when Revolutionary Guards are alleged to have shot and killed at least 10 fuel couriers, known as sookhtbar, in Sistan and Baluchistan Province at the border with Pakistan, after a two-day stand-off triggered by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps blocking the road to the city of Saravan,"" U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a news briefing in Geneva.
The killings had triggered demonstrations in several cities across the province, during which the revolutionary guard and security forces fired lethal ammunition at protesters and bystanders, he said.
Colville said that it has been difficult to verify the death toll due to disruptions of local mobile data networks, but some unconfirmed reports have estimated that as many as 23 people may have been killed.
""We call on the authorities to immediately restore Internet access in areas that remain disconnected,"" he said.

Sistan-Baluchistan’s population is predominantly Sunni Muslim, while most Iranians are Shi’ite. Iran has some of the lowest fuel prices in the world and has been fighting smuggling to neighbouring countries.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - The end of lockdown brought some relief for Kashmir's traditional copper utensil makers, renowned for their immaculate craftsmanship, but their industry is under threat and their earnings low. 
Copperware, locally known as “Traam”, is deep-rooted in Kashmiri culture and is famous for intricate calligraphic engraving that requires extensive time and labour.
Feeling the ever-increasing competition from modern gadgets and home appliances, artisans and sellers were dealt a severe jolt last year by a months-long lockdown imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
""The lockdown troubled us; we didn't get to do any work. There is a slowdown in the market,"" said a shopkeeper, Mushtaq Ahmed, in downtown Srinagar. 
Artisans, mainly based in the old quarters of Indian-administered Kashmir's summer capital Srinagar, engrave the traditional samovar used for boiling water, cutlery sets and other utensils considered a part of every Kashmiri family's heirlooms.
However, their numbers are dwindling as they turn to other ventures to make ends meet.
Artisan Gurmohammad Sheikh said copper had become very expensive while their profits had remained the same.
""We have been labouring for the past 40 years but there has been barely any change in our compensation, it's almost the same as we used to get about 20 years back,"" he said.

The Muslim-majority Himalayan region is claimed in full by nuclear arch-rivals India and Pakistan, though each rule only a small part.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Four Hong Kong democracy activists were released from custody on Friday after prosecutors withdrew an appeal against a court decision to grant them bail in a controversial national security case following marathon hearings this week.
The four are part of a group of 47 activists charged with conspiracy to commit subversion in a case that has triggered global concern that Beijing is using the security law to crush dissent and wipe out meaningful opposition in the former British colony.
The case is the most sweeping use yet of the law, which imposes punishments of up to life in prison for serious charges, including subversion.
The 47 activists, aged 23 to 64, are accused of organising and participating in an unofficial, non-binding primary poll last July that authorities said was part of a ""vicious plot"" to ""overthrow"" the government.
The vote was aimed at selecting the strongest opposition candidates for a Legislative Council election that the government later postponed, citing the coronavirus.
Beijing is planning a major overhaul of Hong Kong's electoral system and Legislative Council elections will likely be deferred again, to September 2022.
Late on Thursday, following four consecutive days of hearings that went on late into the night and saw some of the defendants falling ill and taken to hospital, judge Victor So denied bail to 32 of the defendants.
The other 15 were granted bail under strict conditions, but still kept in custody after government prosecutors appealed against the decision.
On Friday, appeals for Clarisse Yeung, Lawrence Lau, Hendrick Lui and Mike Lam were withdrawn.
They were then granted bail ranging from HK$80,000 ($10,300) to HK$1 million, provided that they surrender all travel documents, abide by a curfew, do not use speech and action that could possibly endanger national security, or organise or take part in elections or contact foreign officials.
The other 11 will appear in three batches in court on Saturday for the prosecutors' appeal to be heard.
For the others - including prominent activists Owen Chow, Lester Shum, Wu Chi-wai, Eddie Chu, Alvin Yeung, Claudia Mo, Gwyneth Ho and Prince Wong - the case was adjourned until May 31. Some are appealing against the decision.
In contrast with the global financial hub's common law traditions, the new security law puts the onus on defendants to prove they will not pose a security threat if released on bail.
Hong Kong laws restrict media coverage of the content of bail hearings.
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms that pro-democracy activists, who brought parts of the city to frequent halts in sometimes violent protests in 2019, say are being whittled away by Communist Party rulers in Beijing. China denies interference.

While critics say the security law has been used to curb freedoms, Beijing and Hong Kong officials say it was vital to end the 2019 violence - political action they say was partly manipulated by foreign governments.

GENEVA (Reuters) - World Health Organization officials said on Friday the risk of an Ebola outbreak spreading from Guinea to its neighbours was ""very high"" and that some neighbouring countries were not prepared for outbreaks or for future vaccination campaigns. 
WHO's Guinea representative, Georges Alfred Ki-Zerbo, told a virtual briefing that 18 cases had been identified and four of those people had died.
So far, 1,604 people have been vaccinated against Ebola in the new outbreak in Guinea, the first resurgence of the virus there since a 2013-2016 outbreak - the world's worst - which spread to several other West African countries and killed thousand of people.
The Ebola virus causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea and is spread through contact with body fluids. 
Officials said a readiness assessment for Guinea's neighbours -- Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Liberia -- showed gaps in their preparedness.
""There are six neighbouring countries to Guinea and we conducted an assessment of readiness. Two of the countries are not ready and one is borderline and there are three countries more or less ready,"" the WHO's Regional Emergency Director Abdou Salam Gueye said by videoconference from Guinea.
He said none of the neighbouring countries was completely ready to start Ebola vaccinations, should they be required, and that there were not enough vaccines doses available in any case to begin vaccinating preventively.
""But those neighbouring countries agreed on cross-border cooperation and coordination to control the outbreak,"" he said.
Ebola vaccines, like some COVID-19 shots, require ultra-cold chain storage which presents logistical challenges. Guinea received COVID-19 vaccine doses donated from China this week.
""We are dealing with quite fragile health systems including (lack of) capacity to address many public health challenges so dealing with both COVID and Ebola remains a challenge,"" said the WHO's Dr Michel Yao, Director of Strategic Health Operations.

In a separate flare-up of a 2018-20 outbreak, the Democratic Republic of Congo has also reported new Ebola cases in recent weeks.

""What they're only interested in is protecting their bloc, they're not interested, as they claim to be, in protecting the Belfast agreement,"" Arlene Foster told BBC radio on Friday. 
""If they were, they would not be taking the action that they're taking a present."" 
The European Union said on Wednesday it would take legal action after the British government unilaterally extended a grace period for checks on food imports to Northern Ireland, a move Brussels said violated the terms of Britain's divorce deal.
Foster said the purpose of the protocol was to stop goods from the UK entering the EU single market, but its effects, and the action taken in both London and Brussels, were ""totally disproportionate"" to the risks.

A volcanic tremor was detected on Wednesday on the Reykjanes Peninsula, suggesting magma activity, the office said in a statement. 
The eruption would not endanger the population or critical infrastructure, but could temporarily halt flights at Keflavik International Airport 20 kilometres (12 miles) away, it said.
The authorities did not expect the kind of massive disruption to global air traffic caused by the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, located further east, in 2010.
""The type of eruption anticipated does not usually involve large explosions or significant production of ash dispersed into the stratosphere. Instead, a relatively slow flow of lava is likely to emerge from a fissure or fissures in the ground,"" Jakobsdottir's office said. 
The eruption in 2010 of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano halted approximately 900,000 flights and forced hundreds of Icelanders from their homes.
On the onset of any eruption, the authorities will initially close Keflavik International Airport and declare a danger area with a radius of 220 kilometres around the eruption point.
After a forecasted area for ash, aviation will continue in accordance with procedures, it said.

""At this point we are no further advanced than we were a year ago,"" said Nikolai Petrovsky, an expert in vaccines at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, and one of 26 global experts who signed the open letter, published on Thursday.
In January, a team of scientists picked by the World Health Organization (WHO) visited hospitals and research institutes in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the coronavirus was identified, in search of clues about the origins of COVID-19.
But the mission has come under fire, with critics accusing the WHO of relying too much on politically compromised Chinese fieldwork and data. 
Team members also said China was reluctant to share vital data that could show COVID-19 was circulating months earlier than first recognised. 
The open letter said the WHO mission ""did not have the mandate, the independence, or the necessary accesses to carry out a full and unrestricted investigation"" into all theories about the origins of COVID-19. 
""All possibilities remain on the table and I have yet to see a single piece of independent scientific data that rules out any of them,"" said Petrovsky.
At a press briefing to mark the end of the WHO visit to Wuhan, mission head Peter Ben Embarek appeared to rule out the possibility that the virus leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan. 
But Petrovsky said it ""doesn't make any sense"" to rule any possibility out, and said the aim of the open letter was ""to get an acknowledgement globally that no one has yet identified the source of the virus and we need to keep searching.""

""We need an open mind and if we close down some avenues because they are considered too sensitive, that is not how science operates,"" he said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police have arrested 12 people for running a stock manipulation scheme that duped investors on social media into buying shares at inflated prices before the stock was dumped, authorities said on Friday.
Raids across Hong Kong this week in a joint investigation by police and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) led to the arrests, although no formal charges have yet been made, and the freezing of assets of up to HK$900 million.
""Our estimate is there is a large number of victims but many of those victims might not want to come forward because they might feel embarrassed about being duped in this way,"" Ashley Alder, the chief executive of SFC, told a news conference.
Police said the 12 arrested ran schemes on platforms such as WeChat by posing as investment professionals offering stock tips and insider information and targeted retail investors to buy small, mostly illiquid stocks.
The role of social media in the manipulation of stock markets has drawn increased scrutiny worldwide following the GameStop (NYSE:GME) saga in the United States.
Shares of the firm soared since January after Reddit users banded together to squeeze hedge funds that had bet against the video game retailer and other companies.
The stocks that figured in the Hong Kong scam were listed on the main and GEM boards of the city's exchange, and generally drew little investor interest soon after their IPOs, Alder said.
Police said the groups boosted the impression of authenticity by posting pictures of well-known stock commentators and their comments. 
More cases are under investigation, the SFC said, adding that similar scams had been the focus of 300 complaints since the middle of last year.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Thirteen defendants charged by New Zealand's workplace regulator in relation to a deadly volcanic eruption more than a year ago made their first appearance in court on Friday.
Twenty-two people died and dozens were injured when the volcano off the coast of New Zealand's North Island erupted in December 2019.
There were 47 people, mostly tourists, on the volcano on White Island, also known by its Maori name of Whakaari, at the time.
Worksafe, New Zealand's primary regulator for workplace-related incidents, says the 13 parties did not meet their health and safety obligations in taking the tourists to White Island.
Under the charges, 10 organisations each face a maximum fine of NZ$1.5 million ($1.06 million), while three individuals, in their capacity as directors, could be fined up to $300,000 each.
Some of the parties include White Island Tours, Whakaari Management, GNS Science and The National Emergency Management Agency.
No pleas were entered at the court in Auckland and the next hearing was scheduled for June.

China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, has increased its military activity near the island in recent months, responding to what it calls ""collusion"" between Taipei and Washington, Taiwan's main international backer and arms supplier.
Speaking at the opening of the annual meeting of China's parliament, Li said Beijing stands by the ""one China"" principle, which states that Taiwan is part of China.
China remains committed ""to promoting the peaceful growth of relations across the Taiwan Strait and China's reunification"", he told the roughly 3,000 delegates at Beijing's Great Hall of the People. 
""We will remain highly vigilant against and resolutely deter any separatist activity seeking Taiwan independence,"" Li added.
""We will promote exchanges, cooperation and integrated development across the Taiwan Strait. Together we can shape a bright future of rejuvenation for our great nation.""
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council responded by urging China to begin ""benign"" interactions with it to gradually resolve disagreements through communication, adding they would continue to defend Taiwan's sovereignty, democracy and freedom.
""Healthy and orderly exchanges are better than enforced pressure on Taiwan,"" it said.
Most Taiwanese people have shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China, and have also strongly supported anti-government protests in Chinese-run Hong Kong.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected by a landslide last year on a promise of defending the island's democracy and standing up to China.
China believes Tsai wishes to push for Taiwan's formal independence, a red line for the Chinese government which has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under Beijing's control. 

Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.

ADZOPE, Ivory Coast (Reuters) - Opposition parties led by two former presidents will try to shake the grip of Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara in a parliamentary election on Saturday, five months after a presidential vote that led to deadly unrest.
Former President Henri Konan Bedie's Democratic Party of Ivory Coast (PDCI) and former President Laurent Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) both boycotted the presidential election last year, which Ouattara won in a landslide.
Eighty-five people died in violence around that election, although the situation has since cooled.
A faction of FPI loyal to Gbagbo and PDCI are now fielding a joint list of candidates against Ouattara's Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace (RHDP). With no reliable public opinions polls available, their prospects are difficult to forecast.
Clear control of parliament would strengthen Ouattara's hand to pursue an agenda based on attracting foreign investment and cutting red tape during his third term, while the vote could be decisive for the opposition to show it remains relevant. 
""Their credibility is at stake because in the event of defeat, the opposition will be reduced to nothing, and risk dividing further, and this can only benefit the party in power,"" said Ousmane Zina, a political analyst.
Other opposition figures, such as former Prime Minister Pascal Affi N'Guessan who leads another FPI faction, are also standing, outside the main joint list.
The PDCI, which dominated politics in Ivory Coast from the 1940s until Bedie was overthrown as president in 1999, backed Ouattara for years but split with him in 2018.
Gbagbo's FPI faction will be fielding candidates for the first time since 2011, when Gbagbo was sent to The Hague to face war crimes charges after a brief civil war sparked by his refusal to concede an election defeat to Ouattara. Gbagbo, acquitted of war crimes by the International Criminal Court in 2019, is expected to return to the country soon.
""For us, this legislative election must be the beginning of the reconquest of power, and the return of the opposition to power,"" said Gbagbo's 50-year old son Michel, a candidate. 
Patrick Achi, Ouattara's chief of staff, told a campaign meeting in the southeast of the country that the election was vital.

""It must confirm the presidential election victory and give President Ouattara the parliamentary majority he needs to carry out his economic and social policies during this term.""

Tens of thousands have been camped outside Delhi since December, demanding Prime Minister Narendra Modi repeal three farm laws that open up the country's agriculture markets to private companies, which the farmers say will make them vulnerable. 
Farmers from the northern states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh plan to stop all traffic on the six-lane Western Peripheral Expressway that forms a ring outside New Delhi for up to five hours, union leaders said on Friday. 
""We believe that after these 100 days, our movement will put a moral pressure on the government to accede to our demands, because the weather will also worsen,"" said Darshan Pal, spokesperson for the farmer unions' coalition Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), or United Farmers’ Front. ""It will weaken the government, which will have to sit down with us to talk again."" 
The government says the reforms will bring investment to the antiquated agriculture markets, and that new entrants would operate alongside government-regulated market yards, where farmers are assured of a minimum price for their produce. 
Several rounds of talks between the government and farm leaders have failed and the movement has gained widespread support, including from international celebrities, posing one of the biggest challenges to Modi since he took power in 2014. 
As the harvesting season begins this month, Pal said neighbours and friends back in the villages would help tend to farms while he and other farmers carry on the protests. 
The capital typically has harsh summers with temperatures rising up to 45 degree Celsius, but Pal said that won't hinder the movement.

""The laws are like a death warrant to us,"" he said. ""We are prepared for the long haul.""

1147,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 01:35AM ET</span>","China's parliament to delay Hong Kong legislative vote, overhaul electoral system","By Clare Jim and Marius Zaharia
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Elections for Hong Kong's legislature will likely be deferred for a second year to September 2022 as Beijing plans a major overhaul of the city's electoral system, a severe blow to remaining hopes of democracy in the global financial hub.
The delay, which the South China Morning Post and other local media reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources, would be in line with a new effort by Beijing to ensure ""patriots"" are in charge of all public institutions in the former British colony.
The National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament, will pass the changes at its annual session which opened on Friday and will last a week.
Senior Chinese lawmaker Wang Chen said China will change the size, composition, and formation method of an electoral committee that chooses Hong Kong's leader and give it powers to pick many of the city's legislators as well.
The changes follow mass anti-government protests in 2019 and a subsequent crackdown that has left most high-profile pro-democracy politicians and activists either in jail or in exile, along with the imposition of a sweeping national security law.
Still, Beijing is keen to eliminate any possibility of the opposition affecting the outcome of elections in Hong Kong, whose return to Chinese rule came with a promise of a high degree of autonomy.
Hong Kong Secretary for Mainland and Constitutional Affairs Erick Tsang has defined patriotism as ""holistic love"" for China, including the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.
Riding high on the back of the 2019 protests, the democratic camp had some slim hopes of winning an unprecedented legislative majority in 2020 elections, which the government postponed, citing the coronavirus.
But with some political parties disbanding and pro-democracy politicians in jail, it is unclear what shape any future opposition will take in Hong Kong and how its message could fit with the patriotic loyalty demanded by the Communist Party.
Beijing had promised universal suffrage as an ultimate goal for Hong Kong in its mini-constitution, the Basic Law. 
""This is more than going backwards, it's getting close to the opposite extreme, moving further away from universal suffrage,"" said Ivan Choy, senior lecturer at Chinese University of Hong Kong's department of government and public administration, referring to the planned changes.
TAKING CONTROL
Local media said the electoral overhaul would include increasing the size of the electoral committee from 1,200 to 1,500, and the city's legislature from 70 to 90 seats.
Currently half of the 70 seats in the Legislative Council, known as LegCo are directly elected, a proportion which will shrink with the extra seats picked by the electoral committee. The other half represents industries, unions, and professions and is largely stacked with pro-Beijing figures.
The representation of community-level district council officials in both the election committee and LegCo is likely to be scrapped, media said.
District councils are the city's only fully democratic institution, and almost 90% of the 452 district seats are controlled by the democratic camp after it humiliated the establishment in a 2019 vote. They mostly deal with mundane issues such as bus stops and garbage collection.
Overall, the moves will reduce democratic representation in both LegCo and the election committee, which must convene before Chief Executive Carrie Lam's five-year term ends in July 2022.
A broader use of patriotic pledges is also expected to enforce loyalty. Such oaths have already been used to disqualify some democratic politicians from LegCo and are likely to be used to oust many of the district councillors.
While critics see the new security law as a tool to crush dissent and curb freedoms, authorities say it was vital to end the 2019 violence and fend off manipulating ""foreign forces.""

In a statement on Friday, Hong Kong leader Lam backed the planned changes, saying ""it is a natural requirement that Hong Kong must be governed by patriots"" and that the changes will ""restore law and order.""

An SBS spokesman told Reuters that programmes from Chinese state media CCTV and CGTN would not air on Saturday and that SBS was reviewing a complaint from a human rights organisation. 
""Given the serious concerns it raises, and the complexity of the material involved, we have made the decision to suspend the broadcast of the overseas-sourced CGTN and CCTV news bulletins while we undertake an assessment of these services,"" SBS said in a statement. 
A story on the SBS News website said human rights organisation Safeguard Defenders wrote to SBS after Britain's media regulator revoked the licence of CGTN due to ""serious non-compliance offences"". 
China's foreign ministry in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The letter from Safeguard Defenders to SBS said CCTV had broadcast the forced confessions of some 56 people between 2013 and 2020. 
""These broadcasts involved the extraction, packaging and airing of forced and false confessions of prisoners held under conditions of duress and torture,"" SBS reported the letter from Safeguard Defenders as saying.

Three female employees of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's Liberal party last month said they had been raped by the same man in 2019 and 2020. The man they accused also worked for the party, but has left since.
So far, one of the alleged victims has lodged a complaint with police after first going public with her accusation, without naming the man. The ensuing media storm has cast Australian politics and the Liberals, in particular, under a harsh spotlight.
""The Parliament of Australia should set the standard for the nation,"" Birmingham told reporters in Adelaide, the state capital of South Australia, amid mounting public pressure for action.
""The Parliament of Australia should reflect best practice in the prevention of, and response to, any instances of bullying, sexual harassment, or sexual assault.""
No timetable has yet been set for any hearings, which could further fuel pressure on lawmakers.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government has been rocked by the series of complaints, which is expected to weigh on public support.
On Wednesday, Attorney-General Christian Porter, the country's chief law officer, identified himself as the subject of a historical rape allegation, declaring his innocence and strongly denying the claim.

A day earlier, police in New South Wales state, where the alleged assault occurred 33 years ago, said there was insufficient evidence to investigate the claim and closed the matter. The alleged victim had not made a formal statement to police detailing her account. She committed suicide last year.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea is seeking to iron out remaining differences and sign a deal with Washington on sharing costs for stationing 28,500 American troops in the country, its chief envoy said on Thursday. 
Jeong Eun-bo made the comment as he arrived in Washington for the first face-to-face talks on Friday with U.S. envoy Donna Welton since President Joe Biden's administration took office in January. They held their first video conference last month. 
The negotiations had been gridlocked after former U.S. President Donald Trump rejected Seoul's offer to pay 13% more, for a total of about $1 billion a year, and demanded as much as $5 billion. 
South Korean sources have raised hopes the Biden administration will agree to a deal close to their proposal. Seoul currently pays Washington about $920 million a year.
""There are issues that we are trying to resolve as much as possible through this upcoming face-to-face meeting,"" Jeong said in televised remarks to reporters in Washington.
Jeong said he was hoping the meeting would be the ""last round of negotiations,"" but added further discussions might be needed. 
""We will be working to strike a deal as early as we can,"" he added. 
Both sides are ""very close"" to agreement, the Yonhap news agency said, citing the U.S. State Department. The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Seoul has also been pursuing a multi-year deal to head off ""operational disturbances"" that had arisen as the allies renew it every three five or years, Jeong said. 
After the last pact expired at the end of 2019 without a new one, some 4,000 South Koreans working for the U.S. military were placed on unpaid leave, prompting the two countries to scramble for a stopgap agreement to let them return to work.
Jeong's visit comes as the Biden administration is conducting a review of its North Korea policy and Washington and Seoul are arranging the first trip to South Korea by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. 

Japan's Kyodo News reported the two Cabinet officials would travel to Japan and South Korea from March 15 to 17, citing unnamed Tokyo officials. Seoul's presidential office said on Friday that both sides were discussing their visit but that no details had been set.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump intensified his war with the Republican establishment on Thursday by attacking Karl Rove, a longtime Republican strategist who criticized Trump's first speech since leaving office for being long on grievances but short on vision.
""He’s a pompous fool with bad advice and always has an agenda,"" Trump complained in a statement issued by his office in Palm Beach, Florida.
Rove, the architect of Republican George W. Bush's presidential victories in 2000 and 2004, wrote in an opinion article in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that Trump's speech last Sunday to the Conservative Political Action Conference was wanting.
Rove noted that in a straw poll of CPAC participants, only 68% wanted Trump to run for president again in 2024, while 32% did not want him to run or had no opinion.
Trump's CPAC speech was noteworthy for rehashing his unfounded claims of election fraud in his November loss to Democrat Joe Biden, despite advice from his team not to do so.
Rove wrote of the 90-minute speech: ""There was no forward-looking agenda, simply a recitation of his greatest hits. People like fresh material. Repetition is useful to a point, but it grows stale.""
The spat was the latest round in the civil war that has erupted within the Republican Party, with establishment figures such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell eager to put Trump in the rearview mirror, and others, like Trump ally Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), believing the party’s future depends on the energy of the pro-Trump base.
But Trump retains strong influence within the party. McConnell, for instance, voted to acquit Trump on impeachment charges, then turned around and called Trump ""practically and morally responsible"" for his supporters' deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol last month, only to then say he would vote for Trump if he is the Republican nominee in 2024.
Trump called Rove -- a familiar figure on the Fox News Channel who writes his points on an erasable whiteboard -- a ""RINO,"" or Republican In Name Only, and said Rove had lobbied him in support of 5G telecommunications.
""Karl Rove has been losing for years, except for himself. He’s a RINO of the highest order, who came to the Oval Office lobbying for 5G for him and a group,"" Trump said.
Trump said Rove had called him on the night of the Nov. 3 election to congratulate him on a ""great victory,"" which was before Biden was declared the winner.
Rove, in a statement to Reuters, dismissed Trump's criticism.

""I’ve been called a lot of things in my career, but never a RINO. I’ve voted for every Republican presidential candidate since I turned 18 and have labored only for GOP (Republican) candidates since then,"" said the 70-year-old Rove. ""I have a different recollection of Mr. Trump’s views on 5G and our conversation election night. I’ll continue to use my whiteboard and voice to call balls and strikes.""

Officials had warned that waves could reach three metres (10 feet) above high tide levels after the quakes - the strongest a magnitude 8.1 - but the largest waves have now passed, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said as it downgraded the threat level.

Video footage posted on social media showed surges of water entering a marina in Northland and on the North Island's East Cape region. 
Earlier on Friday, workers, students and residents in areas like Northland and Bay of Plenty, on the northern coast near Auckland, were put on alert after the three offshore earthquakes in less than eight hours triggered tsunami sirens and warnings.
An emergency alert was issued for all coastal areas around Auckland, a city of 1.7 million, where people were told to stay away from the water's edge. There were no reports of damage or casualties from the quakes.
The third and strongest quake struck the Kermadec Islands, northeast of New Zealand's North Island, on Friday morning, coming shortly after a 7.4 magnitude earthquake in the same region. Earlier, a large 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck about 900 km (540 miles) away on the east of the North Island. 
Linda Tatare, a resident of Anaura Bay, on the North Island's east coast, said the small community of about 50 left for higher ground in the morning. 
""Everyone, and their dogs, are up in the hills,"" Tatare told Reuters. 
""We are safe. We can all see our properties from here.""
Tsunami warnings were also put out for Pacific islands including New Caledonia and Vanuatu, while smaller tsunami waves may be recorded as far away as Antarctica and parts of South America, the U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said.
Scientists said Friday's series of quakes was caused by tectonic movement on the boundary of the Australian and Pacific plates, part of the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire that New Zealand sits on. 
A decade ago, a magnitude 6.3 quake killed 185 people in the South Island city of Christchurch.
Australia issued a marine tsunami threat for Norfolk Island, a tiny Australian territory with about 1,750 residents, but said there was no threat to the mainland.
Norfolk Island residents in areas threatened by land inundation or flooding were advised to go to higher ground or inland, the Bureau of Meteorology said, as small tsunami waves impacted the coastline.

OTSUCHI, Japan (Reuters) - In a garden on a hill, under the wide boughs of a cherry tree, a white phone booth glistens in the early spring light.
Inside, Kazuyoshi Sasaki carefully dials his late wife Miwako's cellphone number, bending his large frame and cradling the handset.
He explains how he searched for her for days after the devastating earthquake and tsunami a decade ago, visiting evacuation centres and makeshift morgues, returning at night to the rubble of their home.
""It all happened in an instant, I can't forget it even now,"" he says, weeping. ""I sent you a message telling you where I was, but you didn't check it.""
""When I came back to the house and looked up at the sky, there were thousands of stars, it was like looking at a jewel box,"" the 67-year old says. ""I cried and cried and knew then that so many people must have died.""
Sasaki's wife was one of nearly 20,000 people in northeastern Japan killed by the disaster that struck on March 11, 2011. 
Many survivors say the unconnected phone line in the town of Otsuchi helps them keep in touch with their loved ones and gives them some solace as they grapple with their grief.
I'M LONELY
Earlier in the day, Sachiko Okawa calls Toichiro, her late husband to whom she was married for 44 years. She asks him what he has been doing with his days since he was swept away by the tsunami a decade ago.
""I'm lonely,"" she says finally, her voice cracking, and asks Toichiro to watch over their family. ""Bye for now, I'll be back soon.""
Okawa says she sometimes feels like she can hear Toichiro on the other end of the line.
""It makes me feel a little better.""
The 76-year-old, who learned about the hillside garden from friends, often brings her two grandsons here so they can also talk to their grandfather.
""Grandpa, it's been 10 years already and I'm going to be in middle school soon,"" says Daina, Okawa's 12-year-old grandson, as they all squeeze into the phone box. ""There's this new virus that's killing lots of people and that's why we're wearing masks. But we're all doing well.""
PHONE OF THE WIND
The phone booth was built by Itaru Sasaki, who owns the garden in Otsuchi, a town some 500 km (310 miles) northeast of Tokyo, a few months before the disaster, after he lost his cousin to cancer. 
""There are many people who were not able to say goodbye,"" he says. ""There are families who wish they could have said something at the end, had they known they wouldn't get to speak again."" 
The phone now attracts thousands of visitors from all over Japan. It is not only used by tsunami survivors, but also by people who have lost relatives to sickness and suicide. Dubbed ""the phone of the wind"", it recently inspired a film. 
A few months ago, Sasaki says he was approached by organisers who want to set up similar phones in Britain and Poland that would allow people to call relatives they had lost in the coronavirus pandemic. 
""Just like a disaster, the pandemic came suddenly and when a death is sudden, the grief a family experiences is also much larger,"" the 76-year-old says. 
I'M SO GLAD WE MET
Like thousands of others in devastated coastal communities, Kazuyoshi Sasaki, the councilman, lost not only his wife but many other relatives and friends in the disaster. 
He had known and loved Miwako for most of his life.
He first confessed his love to her when they were both in junior high school, an offer she promptly rejected. It took another 10 years for the two to begin dating. Eventually, they married and had four children. 
Sasaki explains to his wife that he recently moved out of temporary housing and that their youngest son is now building a new home where he can live with their grandchildren.
Before hanging up, Sasaki tells Miwako that a recent health checkup showed he had lost weight.

""I'll take care of myself,"" he promises her as a strong wind blows outside. ""I'm so glad we met, thank you, we're all doing what we can, talk soon.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An already challenging life combining full-time work as a doctor with mothering two autistic sons was turned upside down for Meenakshi Mourya when the pandemic hit India.
The country has the world's second highest recorded caseload of COVID-19 in the world after the United States and a shortage of healthcare workers puts a heavy burden on those there are.
For almost a month as cases spiked last year, Mourya said she could not spend time with her children as she worked long and gruelling hours treating a flood of patients.
""I was so emotionally down at that time...patients were dying in front of me,"" she said, visibly emotional as she spoke to Reuters in the home she shares with her husband, also a doctor, and their four and nine-year olds, who need help to eat and find it hard to communicate.
""I did not want them to see me, because when they see me, they will cry.""
An anaesthesia specialist at Delhi's biggest public hospital, Safdarjung, Mourya's job was critical during last year's peak, when the Indian capital was recording around 7,000-8,000 new cases every day.
At home, her sons sat at the window, pining for her, she said. The lockdown meant their special education classes were halted too, putting extra pressure on their female carer.
""They were restless, uncomfortable, crying all the time, and waiting for me, sitting at the window ... sometimes in a very confused state, not eating well,"" Mourya said.
With more than 11 million recorded cases of COVID-19 and more than 150,000 deaths, India has seen cases rising again since early February. In Delhi, though, the virus is now under far better control, allowing Mourya more time with her kids.
They still cry when she leaves for work, often clinging to the window for hours, but when she comes home, she says she is now able to enjoy giving them the intensive care they need.
And there has been a bright spot in the family's ordeal: while the older son finds speech difficult, the younger one has begun using words, among them, 'Papa'.

(Reuters) - The second of three women who have accused New York Governor Andrew Cuomo of sexual misconduct rejected his public apology on Thursday, a response likely to ratchet up pressure on the embattled Democrat.
Charlotte Bennett, a 25-year-old former aide to Cuomo who has said the governor questioned her about her sex life with what she took as sexual overtones, made her comments in an interview broadcast by CBS News.
""It's not an apology. It's not an issue of my feelings. It's an issue of his actions. The fact is that he was sexually harassing me and he has not apologized for sexually harassing me and he can't even use my name,"" Bennett said.
Three women including Bennett have come forward to accuse Cuomo, 63, of sexually harassing them or making inappropriate remarks. He has denied any misconduct and pledged to cooperate with a review by the state's attorney general. 
On Wednesday he offered a lengthy and sometimes emotional public apology, saying: ""I feel awful about it and frankly I am embarrassed by it."" 
Lindsey Boylan, a 36-year-old former Cuomo aide who first spoke out in December, has said the unwanted advances from the governor included an unsolicited kiss on the lips. 
Boylan, a candidate for Manhattan borough president, also dismissed the governor's apology. ""How can New Yorkers trust you @NYGovCuomo to lead our state if you ""don't know"" when you've been inappropriate with your own staff?"" she wrote on Twitter. 
The governor, who has rejected calls for his resignation that have come even from prominent Democratic state lawmakers, has also battled in recent weeks to respond to accusations that his administration sought to downplay the number of nursing home residents killed by COVID-19. 
Bennett, a former executive assistant and health policy adviser, told the New York Times in February that Cuomo peppered her with questions about her romantic life last year in what she viewed as an effort to have sex with her.

A third woman has told the New York Times that the governor made unwanted advances and physical contact after meeting her at a wedding in 2019.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden has asked senior officials to travel to the U.S.-Mexico border and brief him on the government response to the influx of unaccompanied minors and steps to ensure their safety and care, a White House spokesman said on Thursday.
Biden's administration is facing criticism from Democrats and activists who say unaccompanied migrant children and families are being held too long in detention centers instead of being released while their asylum applications are considered.
For their part, Republicans and immigration hawks complain that the willingness to let in more migrants while their asylum applications are being heard has encouraged more migration from Central America.
“President Biden has asked senior members of his team to travel to the border region in order to provide a full briefing to him on the government response to the influx of unaccompanied minors and an assessment of additional steps that can be taken to ensure the safety and care of these children,"" White House spokesman Vedant Patel said.
The timing of the visit would remain confidential because of security and privacy concerns, Patel said.

U.S. Border Patrol agents caught more than 4,500 migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border on Wednesday, according to government figures shared with Reuters, a large single-day tally that comes amid growing fears that illegal entries could soar in the coming weeks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vice President Kamala Harris, in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, reaffirmed U.S. opposition to an International Criminal Court probe of possible war crimes in the Palestinian Territories, the White House said.
The call, the first between the two since Harris and President Joe Biden took office in January, came a day after the ICC prosecutor said she would launch the probe, prompting swift rejections by Washington and Jerusalem.
Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, who will be replaced by British prosecutor Karim Khan on June 16, said in December 2019 that war crimes had been or were being committed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. She named both the Israel Defense Forces and armed Palestinian groups such as Hamas as possible perpetrators.
Harris and Netanyahu noted their governments’ ""opposition to the International Criminal Court’s attempts to exercise its jurisdiction over Israeli personnel,"" the White House said.
The two agreed to continue to cooperate on regional security issues, specifically Iran’s nuclear program and ""dangerous"" behavior, the White House statement said.
Harris ""emphasized the United States’ unwavering commitment to Israel’s security,"" the statement added.
Biden's bid to revive a 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers sets him and Netanyahu on a potential collision course. The Israeli prime minister opposed the nuclear deal and applauded former President Donald Trump’s decision to abandon it in 2018.

Harris also congratulated Netanyahu on Israel’s coronavirus vaccine program and they agreed to increase cooperation on the coronavirus, water, green energy and other initiatives, the White House said.

(Reuters) - A cremation chamber, like a large stove with golden doors, sits in a room with dimmed lights, a few brooms and a cart with heat protective gear.
Eddie Martinez has been spending a lot of time here lately as the increased demand for funerals and cremation services has stretched his role at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, a Los Angeles landmark and resting place for thousands of American movie legends.
""I used to be just a funeral coordinator. Now I assist with cremations as well. I assist with casketing, with dressing,"" Martinez, 31, said.
The team handled two cremations a day at most before the pandemic, said Martinez, who has worked at the cemetery for six years. The process can take up to six hours.
A few months ago, a second shift was added to conduct four cremations daily. A second cremation chamber will soon be added.
At Hollywood Forever Cemetery, cremations tripled to about 60 in January from the year-ago total. In mid-January, the South Coast Air Quality Management District lifted air quality regulations that limited the number of cremations to protect public health.
The work comes with an emotional toll but is gratifying, said Martinez, a father of three who has been fascinated with death and mummies since childhood.
""It was definitely an eye opener when it started hitting close to home, and to seeing a friend come to me, letting me know that her relative was in our care,"" he said.
""I feel like I'm doing my part in helping the families ... and try just avoid any negative thoughts.""
Social distancing signs are displayed throughout the cemetery, but it is difficult to restrain mourners.

""Families' emotions come over them and they just go for it and they hug each other,"" he said. ""We can't tell people to hold their emotions in until they get home.""

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A clash was averted over who represents Myanmar at the United Nations in New York following a Feb. 1 military coup, after the junta's replacement quit and the Myanmar U.N. mission confirmed that Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun remained in the job. 
Kyaw Moe Tun was fired by the junta on Saturday, a day after he urged countries at the 193-member U.N. General Assembly to use ""any means necessary"" to reverse the coup that ousted the nation's elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
The junta appointed deputy U.N. Ambassador Tin Maung Naing to replace him, but he has since resigned and Myanmar's U.N. mission told the United Nations, in a note seen by Reuters on Thursday, that Kyaw Moe Tun remained the country's envoy.
In Washington, Myanmar's embassy also signaled a break with the junta on Thursday, issuing a statement decrying the deaths of civilians protesting the coup and calling on authorities to ""fully exercise utmost restraint.""
Police in Myanmar broke up demonstrations in several places with tear gas and gunfire on Thursday as protesters took to the streets again, undeterred by the rising death toll in a crackdown on coup opponents.
""Instead of demonstrating respect for the rule of law, pursuing dialogue and refraining from violence, the military has dramatically accelerated violence against the people of Burma,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said on Thursday. ""This is simply unacceptable.""
Myanmar's representation at the United Nations could become an issue again if the junta tries to appoint a new ambassador. Rival claims on a seat at the world body are ultimately addressed by the 193-member U.N. General Assembly.
The U.N. special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, has warned that no country should recognize or legitimize the Myanmar junta.
In Washington it was unclear whether the embassy was representing the junta. The embassy's statement did not denounce the coup itself and said the embassy will continue to carry out its functions representing the state of Myanmar.
Reuters was unable to reach Myanmar's ambassador to the United States, Aung Lynn.
A diplomat in the embassy resigned last month over the coup and at least another three other embassy staff posted on their Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) pages on Thursday that they were joining the civil disobedience movement against the military government. 
""I urge to respect the result of the 2020 November election and to return the state power to the people,"" the three wrote in similar posts, adding that the statements did not mean they were resigning from the embassy. 
The U.N. Security Council is due to discuss Myanmar on Friday in a closed meeting. The 15-member council has voiced concern over the state of emergency, but stopped short of condemning the coup due to opposition from Russia and China.

""The people of Burma have stood firm for democracy, our voices need to be equally firm, and they must be united in supporting the people of Burma,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 04:45PM ET</span>",Biden's Iran approach praised as deft despite lack of progress,"By Arshad Mohammed and John Irish
WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's refusal to offer upfront sanctions relief to Iran may have angered Tehran's clerical rulers but it has won some praise at home despite his failure so far to draw Iran into nuclear talks or deter attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq.
""Sensible,"" said Elliott Abrams, former President Donald Trump's special envoy for Iran, of Biden's unwillingness to give Tehran sanctions relief before any talks on both sides resuming compliance with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
""Negotiation is always a give and take but we should not pay them just for the pleasure of their company at the negotiating table,"" Abrams said.
Trump bequeathed Biden a nettlesome problem by abandoning the 2015 agreement that limited Iran's nuclear program to make it harder to develop an atomic bomb - an ambition Tehran denies - in return for the lifting of sanctions.
The result is a diplomatic and military challenge as Biden seeks to revive and eventually broaden the pact to put greater limits on Iran's nuclear program and its missile development, as well as constrain its regional activities. 
That the Democratic president should be commended by a Republican official is striking given the chasm between the U.S. political parties and illustrates Biden's balancing act as he tries to resuscitate the deal without being pilloried by U.S. conservatives.
Analysts described Biden's approach to Iran as skillful in keeping the sanctions leverage he inherited from Trump and hence protecting himself from domestic criticism, while taking a harder line on rocket attacks by Iranian proxies in Iraq.
Washington launched air strikes on Iran-backed fighters in Syria on Feb. 25 in response to a Feb. 15 rocket attack on a base hosting U.S. troops in Erbil, Iraq, that killed a non-U.S. contractor and wounded American contractors and a U.S. service member.
U.S. defense officials told Reuters Biden approved the most limited option, saying he aimed to signal to Tehran that Washington would not accept U.S. citizens being killed or injured but also did not want a military escalation.
The defense officials said they did not expect rocket attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq to stop after one strike in Syria, but said they aimed to set a marker that while diplomacy was the first choice, military tools were available.
DIPLOMACY AND DOMESTIC OPPOSITION
While saying Biden had been deft in his early diplomacy and last week's air strikes, former French ambassador to the United States Gerard Araud suggested the president's team had made a virtue of necessity by rejecting Iran's demands for immediate sanctions relief.
""They didn't do it because they couldn't do it domestically (and appear) to make this gift to the Iranians,"" Araud said.
Clement Therme, an Iran expert at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, said Biden avoided stirring up domestic opposition but that could not last forever.
""They are deft in the sense that they aren't going to extinguish their political capital just after the elections to extend a hand to an Iranian government that's been despised in the U.S. for the last 30 years,"" he said.
Trump faulted the 2015 nuclear pact for failing to rein in Iran's support for proxy forces, and he reimposed U.S. sanctions after withdrawing from the deal in 2018.
After waiting a year, Iran took its own steps to violate the deal by expanding its nuclear activities. Iranian-backed proxies also stepped up attacks during the summer of 2019, including on tankers in the Gulf and on Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure.
Tehran has denied being behind any of the attacks, whether those in Iraq, against shipping in the Gulf, or on Saudi installations by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis.
Senior Biden administration officials on Sunday said Iran had rebuffed their first overture - an offer of European Union-hosted talks between Iran and the six major powers in the deal: Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States.
U.S. officials responded with sangfroid, with one saying on Sunday: ""We don't think that this is the end of the road.""
Iran has sent encouraging signs in recent days about talks, two European sources said on Thursday after European powers scrapped plans to criticize Tehran at the U.N. nuclear watchdog. 
A French diplomatic source said the Biden administration must avoid a ""stop and go"" situation where one president agrees to something, only to be reversed by their successor. That means winning Democratic and Republican support.
""It doesn't have much choice but to expend political capital on this because in the campaign they talked about a return to (the 2015 deal) and a broader deal,"" said the source. 

""What needs to be built is a more consensual and bipartisan framework that survives a change in administration.""

1165,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 03:55PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Amid shortage, U.S. suppliers to Chinese chip giant SMIC struggle to get export licenses","By Karen Freifeld and Alexandra Alper
(Reuters) - The U.S. government has been slow to approve licenses for American companies like  Lam Research Corp  (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT) to sell chipmaking equipment to China semiconductor giant SMIC, sources said, as the impact of a global chip shortage spreads.
Many licenses for U.S. suppliers to ship an estimated $5 billion dollars' worth of equipment and materials have not come through, according to more than half a dozen industry sources, though numerous companies submitted applications soon after the Chinese company was blacklisted in December. Certain licenses have been granted, including for small numbers of expensive equipment in recent days.
As policy shifts under President Joe Biden, who took over from Donald Trump in January, U.S. government agencies led by new appointees still have not completely decided what should be sold to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, which produces chips for Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and other American companies. 
The Trump administration placed SMIC on the U.S. Department of Commerce's entity list over concerns of SMIC aiding China's military.
The listing, which requires U.S. suppliers to obtain a license before shipping goods to SMIC, is unusual because it says most products should be granted on a case-by-case basis. However, equipment that can be used to make only the most advanced, 10-nanometer and smaller chips is likely to be denied licenses.
The administration is supposed to make decisions on license applications within a month, but follow-up questions stop the clock.
""Lam Research is still in the application process and has not yet received a response,"" a Fremont, California, company spokeswoman said on Wednesday.
Applied Materials' chief financial officer said in a Feb. 18 earnings call its forecast did not assume licenses would come through. A spokesman for the Santa Clara, California-based company declined further comment on the licenses this week.
SMIC did not respond to requests for comment, but the company has said it provides services solely for civilian and commercial end users and that it has no ties to the Chinese military. 
Decisions on licenses have been held up as officials ask follow-up questions about applications in part to determine whether the parts or components could be diverted for use in producing items 10 nm or smaller, sources said.
Washington trade lawyer Giovanna Cinelli said many license applications have resulted in ""a lot of back and forth, which has elongated the period of review."" 
In a statement, a Commerce Department official dismissed the possibility that curbs on SMIC could contribute to the chip shortage, noting that the shortfall was tied to older technologies while SMIC restrictions relate to leading-edge technology. The statement did not address the potential impact of delays in licenses for older technology.
SMIC, the largest foundry in mainland China, is an important player in the global semiconductor supply chain, which is under pressure as pandemic lockdowns drive up demand for electronics such as laptops and phones. Last month, it said it could not meet customer demands for certain technologies and its plants have been running ""fully loaded"" for several quarters.
SMIC's technological capabilities lag far behind cutting-edge foundries like industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, according to industry sources.
Companies like Applied Materials and Lam Research, two key suppliers of production equipment, submitted numerous license applications to sell to the company. The bulk have not yet been acted on, industry sources said. 
A spokeswoman for Entegris (NASDAQ:ENTG) Inc, an advanced materials supplier, said the Massachusetts-based company had submitted 10 applications to sell to SMIC and received its first license in the past week.
Other companies that ship to SMIC include California's KLA Corp and Massachusetts-based Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS) Inc . A KLA spokeswoman declined to comment on any licenses and, while Axcelis' CEO spoke of ""uncertainty"" related to its licenses on Feb. 11, a company spokeswoman declined to provide an update.
Cymer, a San Diego company that makes deep ultraviolet light sources, is also among suppliers that need licenses to send parts to SMIC. A spokeswoman for ASML, the Dutch chip equipment maker that owns Cymer, declined to comment on the licenses, saying she could not discuss customer-specific information. 
Qualcomm, which uses the Chinese foundry to produce chips with decades-old technology, put in applications for tools SMIC needs to produce the chips, just in case equipment makers do not get their licenses for the tools, an industry source said. But they have not come through yet, the source added. 

In September, SEMI, a worldwide industry group, said in a draft letter seen by Reuters that SMIC accounts for as much as $5 billion in annual U.S. sales.

PARIS (Reuters) - Iran has given encouraging signs in recent days about opening informal talks with world powers and the United States, two European sources said on Thursday after European powers scrapped plans to criticise Tehran at the U.N. nuclear watchdog.
Iran has so far refused to take part in a meeting brokered by the European Union between world powers and the United States on reviving its 2015 nuclear deal. 
""Things are moving in the right direction and we have had positive signals this week and especially in last few days,"" a French diplomatic source said. 
The source added the objective was to get everyone around the table before the start of Nowruz, the Iranian New Year, on March 20, when Iran slows down administratively.
He added that the window would also narrow from mid-April when Iran's presidential election campaign kicks in.
""We are putting all our efforts so that this (meeting) can take place in the days or coming weeks,"" the source said.
A second European source also said there had been positive signals from the Iranian side.
Diplomats said the obstacle for talks was that Iran was setting preconditions for attending to ensure that there would be a pathway to sanctions relief after the meeting, something the U.S. could not accept.
""It's not a matter of giving an assurance of something that we'd do. It's sitting down and making sure that both sides do – as a first step, as a second step, whatever it is – that both sides are taking positive steps,"" a senior U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
""We can't tell them in advance what we're going to do if we don't know what they are going to do."" 
An Iranian official declined to comment.
""Internal Iranian politics is causing constraints for the Iranian government which does not want to be at the same table as the Americans for the first time in years without being sure that it would lead at the end of this meeting to an effective process to lift sanctions,"" said the French diplomatic source.
Iran's nuclear policy is decided by the country's top authority, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and not the president or the government.

Britain, France and Germany decided to pause the submission of a resolution critical of Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency on Thursday to not harm the prospects for diplomacy and after what they said were concessions gained from Iran to deal with outstanding nuclear.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alabama's governor said on Thursday she was extending the state's mask mandate for another month, heeding the advice of public health experts and breaking with decisions by neighboring Mississippi and Texas this week to lift their requirements. 
Alabama’s mask mandate, due to expire on Friday, will remain in effect to April 9, but no longer, Governor Kay Ivey said.
“After that, it’ll be personal responsibility,” the Republican said at a briefing, adding that she plans to continue wearing her mask beyond that date. ""Folks, we’re not there yet, but goodness knows we’re getting closer."" 
The contrasting moves on masks in the three Republican-led Southern states comes at a time when the number of new coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths had been sharply falling in the United States after a surge that followed the holiday season. At the same time, governors around the country are easing many restrictions that had been in place to curb the infection rate.
About 45,000 COVID-19 patients were being treated in U.S. hospitals as of Wednesday night, compared with a peak of about 132,000 on Jan. 6.
The improving metric in part reflects an acceleration of the drive to distribute the COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. A third authorized vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) began going into arms this week.
Even so, health authorities have stressed the need for caution, urging Americans to keep wearing masks, practice social distancing and other measures to prevent the spread of the virus amid concerns that declines in new infections was plateauing with highly contagious newer virus variants widely circulating.
""Now is not the time to pull back,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official and President Joe Biden's COVD-19 medical adviser, told MSNBC on Thursday in an interview.
""We were going in the right direction. Now is the time to keep the foot on the accelerator and not pull off,"" he said, referring to the announcements that Texas and Mississippi were lifting mask mandates.
'GOVERNMENT CAN'T DO THIS ALONE'
The White House on Thursday continued to push back against the lifting of mask mandates and other COVID-19 public health measures, and called for cooperation from the public. 
""He can't do this alone. The federal government can't do this alone. This is going to require additional sacrifice from the American people,"" spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters at a briefing, adding that the administration welcomed Alabama's move to maintain its mask mandate.
Since the pandemic reached the United States early last year, the country has recorded 28.9 million cases and more than 519,000 deaths, more than any other country in the world.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Thursday defended the decision to discontinue requiring Texans to wear masks in public, effective March 10.
""Before now, there actually has not been any enforcement of the mask requirement,"" he said in an interview on CNBC. ""We continue to make wearing a mask a suggestion, and we urge all Texans to wear a mask when they are out.""
Texas, Mississippi and Alabama are near the bottom of the list of states in administering vaccines, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based on the number of people per thousand who have gotten at least one dose. The governors of all three states are Republicans. 
Texas, Mississippi and Alabama are also near the top of the list in percentage of people who test positive for COVID-19, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.
Alabama's delay in lifting its mandate will enable more of its 4.9 million residents to be inoculated after the state just administered its 1 millionth dose of vaccine, Ivey said.
Ivey did announce an end to indoor dining restrictions on restaurants and said summer camps can plan to reopen. She is also permitting senior centers to resume outdoor programs and increase the maximum number of visitors from one to two.
Among the improvements she cited was a 77% drop in COVID-19 hospitalizations from its Jan. 11 peak to its lowest level since last June.

“While I'm convinced that a mask mandate has been the right thing to do, I also respect those who object, and believe that this was a step too far in government overreach,” she said.

1168,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 03:01PM ET</span>",The young Afghan media worker who risked all for women's rights,"By Orooj Hakimi, Abdul Qadir Sediqi and Charlotte Greenfield
KABUL (Reuters) - Last December, Afghan media worker Shahnaz Mohmand rushed to comfort her female colleagues as they reeled in shock after fellow employee Malala Maiwand was shot dead in the eastern city of Jalalabad.
""Don't lose yourself, you have to be strong,"" she said as she hugged Nadia Momand, the 21-year-old producer recalled. ""There are many things that we have to do for our society, especially for women and girls.""
Now the same newsroom is mourning Shahnaz. Aged 20, she was one of three female employees at Enikas TV gunned down on their way home from work on Tuesday.
Authorities believe it was the latest in a series of targeted attacks on female journalists, civil society members and working women.
Some officials and diplomats blame the violence on the Taliban, which, since being ousted in a U.S.-led war in 2001, has fought an insurgency in which thousands of civilians have died.
The hardline Islamist group is involved in U.S.-brokered peace talks which began in Qatar in September, but attacks have continued unabated.
The Taliban denies the charge and said it was not behind Shahnaz's death. An offshoot of Islamic State claimed the attack.
The killings are a stark reminder of how hard-fought gains for women's rights after the fall of the Taliban are under threat, as the country wrestles with lawlessness and militant violence and as foreign troops leave.
Billions of dollars have been poured into the country in the last 20 years to help create a more open and equal society.
But officials fear that, with the Taliban seeking to return to formal power and only a small contingent of foreign troops remaining, conservative elements of society will be emboldened to demand that women stay at home.
""Afghan women working in the media sector are especially targeted,"" said Stefano Pontecorvo, NATO's Senior Civilian Representative to Afghanistan, in a statement condemning Tuesday's attack.
""Their voices are more important than ever to ensure lasting peace in Afghanistan.""
COURAGE IN FACE OF FEAR
Zalmai Latifi, head of Enikas TV, said the station had temporarily closed and would likely give female employees leave. Some may not return, given that four of the 10 female staff have been killed.
Women in public roles have been targeted in the wave of deadly violence concentrated in urban centres, including female judges and a member of the country's independent human rights commission.
Afghan politician and negotiator Fawzia Koofi survived an assassination attempt in August, shortly before she flew to Doha to take part in peace talks.
Also killed on Tuesday were Mursal Wahidi and Sadia Sadat, both in their late teens or early 20s, who worked with Shahnaz in the dubbing department providing voice-overs in Pashto.
Mujib Khalwatgar, head of media advocacy group NAI, said journalists were fleeing the country for fear of attack, and this week's violence could dissuade female media employees in Jalalabad and the surrounding province from working.
Aqela, a 19-year-old student, journalist and activist in the city, said she was scared every time she left the house. Her family has told her to stop working and attending university, but she is carrying on for now.
Momand, from Enikas TV, said her father told her to quit her job, though she is determined to carry on if possible.
""My friends were taken away from me, but after this I will fight not only for myself but also for my friends,"" she told Reuters. ""This incident has left a deep impact on my soul.""
Shahnaz's friends and family said she had been acutely aware of the risks women faced and made it her short life's mission to tackle them head on.
As a teenager she taught local women how to read, spoke out fiercely when family members joked about women's rights, and took on a job at Enikas TV while saving to go to law school.
After Maiwand's killing in December, Shahnaz's brother, Haroon Rahimi, said that privately she was afraid. But as soon as she was allowed to go back to the office, she did.

""She knew the consequences,"" Rahimi explained. ""But she still went there and said: 'if I'm not going to risk it, no one is going to risk it'.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Thursday it is ""now abundantly clear to all"" that Eritrean troops are operating throughout Ethiopia's northern Tigray region and ""well-corroborated"" reports suggest they are responsible for atrocities.
""Eritrean Defence Forces must leave Ethiopia, and they must not be enabled or permitted to continue their campaign of destruction before they do so,"" U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock told the U.N. Security Council according to remarks seen by Reuters.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also called on Eritrean troops to leave Tigray, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Thursday. 
Both the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments have denied Eritrean troops are in Tigray, despite dozens of eyewitness accounts and admissions that Eritreans are there from Tigray's federally-appointed regional administration.
""It is now abundantly clear to all, and openly acknowledged by officials of the government administration in Tigray, that Eritrean Defence Forces are operating throughout Tigray,"" Lowcock said. ""Countless well-corroborated reports suggest their culpability for atrocities.""
Eritrea's Foreign Minister Osman Saleh Mohammed and Eritrea's Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel did not return calls and text messages seeking a response to Lowcock's remarks. 
Speaking after Lowcock's closed briefing of the 15-member Security Council, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Washington was alarmed by the humanitarian and human rights situation in Ethiopia. 
""We urged the Ethiopian government to support an immediate end to the fighting in Tigray, and to that end the prompt withdrawal of Eritrean forces and Amhara regional forces from Tigray are essential steps,"" she said, also referring to troops from Ethiopia's Amhara region that neighbors Tigray.
The U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet asked Ethiopia on Thursday to allow monitors into Tigray to investigate reports of killings and sexual violence that may amount to war crimes in the northern region since late 2020.
""Multiple credible and widely corroborated reports from Tigray ... speak of widespread atrocities, involving mass killings, rapes and abductions of civilians,"" Lowcock told the council. ""In one widely reported and heavily corroborated incident, Eritrean soldiers are alleged to have deliberately killed worshippers inside a historic Christian church in Axum.""
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered air strikes and a ground offensive against Tigray's former ruling party - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - after regional forces attacked federal army bases in the region on Nov. 4. 
The TPLF withdrew from the regional capital, Mekelle, and major cities, but low-level fighting has continued. 

Thousands of people have died, hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes and there are shortages of food, water and medicine in the region of more than 5 million people.

After being hospitalised with COVID last year, Johnson has often spoken about how he believes his weight was behind how severely ill he became and how since then he has started a new exercise regime and no late-night cheese diet.
Evidence emerging around the world suggests that people who are overweight or obese are at increased risk of getting more severely ill with COVID-19.
""I've been doing a lot, in fact everything I can, to lose weight and to feel fitter and healthier. And what I've been doing is I've been eating less carbs, avoiding chocolate, no more late night cheese, I've been getting up early to go for runs and the result is that I actually have lost some weight,"" he said on Twitter, unveiling a new scheme to get people fitter.
""What we want to do is encourage another 700,000 people around the country who have the kind of problems that I have had to do the same thing, so we'll be not just fitter but also healthier and happier and we'll bounce back better together.""
The government, he said, would spend 100 million pounds to help people to access doctors' appointments, access the right Apps to help with weight loss and that it was looking at what he called fit miles schemes as well.
His press secretary, Allegra Stratton, told reporters the British leader had lost most probably more than the 14 pounds (6 kilograms), or a stone, he talks about as she believed he was being modest, adding that he takes his diet ""very seriously.""
Asked if he had given up drinking alcohol, Stratton said she wasn't sure if he had cut it out completely. ""He certainly was offered a drink yesterday and said no, no I am not drinking at the moment.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Doctors Without Borders (MSF) staged a protest at the World Trade Organization on Thursday against what it said was the rich world's reluctance to waive patents and allow more production of COVID-19 vaccines for poorer nations.
Activists seeking a waiver of intellectual property rules unfurled a huge sign reading ""No COVID Monopolies - Wealthy Countries Stop Blocking TRIPS Waiver"" in the park next to WTO's headquarters on Lake Geneva.
They want the terms of the TRIPS agreement -- the WTO's Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property -- to be overridden to allow generic or other manufactures to make the new products.
WTO member states hold fresh talks next week on a proposal by India and South Africa to waive such rules for COVID-19 drugs and vaccines. 
""If we had the waiver, we'd be able in a number of countries to scale up production right now, which would allow for the diagnostics, the medicines, and the vaccines to get where they're needed most,"" Stephen Cornish, general director of MSF Switzerland, told Reuters at the WTO.
""Right now we are seeing just a trickle of vaccines making it to the global South, and this is just not acceptable in today's world,"" he said.
Some 100 countries now support the campaign, Cornish added.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), backed the move in a tweet on Thursday: ""If a temporary waiver to patents cannot be issued now, during these unprecedented times, when will be the right time?"" 
“Big Pharma” has rejected the proposal that would grant compulsory licensing by overriding patent rules. Britain, Switzerland and the United States, which have strong domestic pharmaceutical industries, have opposed a waiver.
""Rich countries, the EU, the US, Canada and Switzerland ... are blocking that derogation. And they are doing so in the name of profit and business and status quo instead of putting human lives above profit,"" Cornish said.
Globally, 265 million doses of vaccines have been administered, with 80% in just 10 countries, WHO's top emergency expert Mike Ryan said on social media on Wednesday night.
He welcomed the first roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines this week through the COVAX facility that aims to provide doses to lower income countries, starting in Ivory Coast.

Nearly 10 million doses have been delivered in more than 10 countries, he said, adding: ""That's a huge step forward in terms of at least beginning the journey towards better vaccine equity around the world.""

1172,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 08:56AM ET</span>",UK police rule out criminal inquiry into 1995 Princess Diana interview,"LONDON (Reuters) - British police said on Thursday they had ruled out a criminal investigation into the famous 1995 BBC interview with the late Princess Diana, after complaints from her brother that she had been tricked into taking part with the use of forged documents.
Diana's interview with journalist Martin Bashir, watched by more than 20 million viewers in Britain, shocked the nation when she admitted to an affair and gave other intimate details of her failed marriage to heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles.
Last November, her brother Charles Spencer said the BBC had failed to apologise for what he said were forged documents and ""other deceit"" which led him to introduce Diana to Bashir.
""In recent months the Metropolitan Police Service received correspondence alleging unlawful activity in connection with a documentary broadcast in 1995,"" Commander Alex Murray said in a statement.
He said the issue had been assessed by specialist officers and they had been given extensive legal advice.
""Following this detailed assessment and in view of the advice we received, we have determined that it is not appropriate to begin a criminal investigation into these allegations. No further action will be taken,"" Murray said.
The police decision comes days before an interview between Diana's youngest son, Prince Harry, and his wife Meghan with U.S. talk show host Oprah Winfrey is due to be broadcast.
That interview has already caused a crisis in the royal family before it has been aired, amid allegations of bullying against Meghan and her counter claims Buckingham Palace has been ""perpetuating falsehoods"".
Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997, made her first public comments about her doomed marriage in the 1995 interview, but her brother said it had been secured after he was shown false bank statements amid other dishonest practices. 

His comments prompted the BBC to announce a former UK Supreme Court judge would lead an inquiry into how the broadcaster secured the interview and whether executives covered up any wrongdoing, a move welcomed by Harry and his elder brother Prince William.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The fiancee of slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi said on Thursday that world leaders should not maintain relations with a ""murderer"", after a U.S. intelligence report implicated Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler in his killing.
Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018. Turkish officials believe his body was dismembered and removed. His remains have not been found.
A U.S. intelligence report released last Friday said Prince Mohammed had approved the operation to kill or capture Khashoggi in Oct. 2018. The Saudi government has denied any involvement by the crown prince and rejected the report's findings.
While Washington imposed sanctions on some of those involved, it spared the crown prince himself.
Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi's Turkish fiancee who was waiting outside the consulate when he entered to retrieve documents for their upcoming marriage, said the report was ""a very huge and important step"" in the path to justice, but must be acted on.
""That it was said there would be no sanctions against the person who gave the order for the crime to be committed created a strange dilemma in everyone's minds. But this could change in the coming days,"" she told Reuters in an interview.
""The process of seeking justice is a long process, sometimes it is not easy.""
HEARING
Cengiz was speaking after a court session of the trial in absentia of 26 Saudi officials over Khashoggi's killing, in which lawyer Ali Ceylan asked that the U.S. report be added to the case file.
The judge said Ceylan should file the request through the prosecutor and Cengiz, who is named as a complainant in the case, said they would apply for Prince Mohammed to be added as a defendant.
The court heard Edip Yilmaz, a driver for the Saudi consulate, say that on the day of the killing he was told by the head of security that for 20 minutes he should not leave a consulate basement room where he usually spent his time.
In September, a Saudi court jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years over the killing, in a trial that critics said lacked transparency. None of the defendants was named.
Tensions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi's killing have led to an informal Saudi boycott of Turkish goods. Official data shows that Turkish exports to Saudi Arabia have fallen by more than 90%.
Cengiz said she believed justice would be served eventually.

""Those in power need to take action,"" she said. ""Otherwise they will build their policies in the short to medium term based on a relation with someone who is proved to be a murderer.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations' human rights chief asked Ethiopia on Thursday to allow monitors into Tigray to investigate reports of killings and sexual violence that may amount to war crimes in the northern region since late 2020.
""Victims and survivors of these violations must not be denied their rights to the truth and to justice,"" Michelle Bachelet said in a statement, expressing her fear that violations could continue without outside scrutiny.
Fighting between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's federal troops and forces of the region's former ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), has killed thousands of people, forced hundreds of thousands from their homes and hit infrastructure badly.
Until this month, the mountainous region of about 5 million people - with a long history of conflict including war with neighbouring Eritrea - had been off-limits for most media since fighting began in early November. Relief agencies had also struggled for access, while communications were patchy. 
""Serious violations of international law, possibly amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity, may have been committed by multiple actors in the conflict,"" Bachelet added, mentioning Ethiopia's army, the TPLF, Eritrea's military, and troops and militia from the neighbouring Amhara region.
Abiy's government, the Tigray administration, the TPLF, as well as authorities in Amhara and Eritrea, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the U.N. statement. 
With witness accounts of atrocities including rape, looting and massacres emerging from refugees and others, the warring sides have been repeatedly blaming each other. 
Abiy declared victory when the TPLF abandoned the regional capital Mekelle at the end of November. But lower-level fighting has continued in some areas, according to people in Tigray and U.N. assessments. 
MASSACRES
""Deeply distressing reports of sexual and gender-based violence, extrajudicial killings, widespread destruction and looting of public and private property by all parties continue to be shared with us,"" Bachelet said. 
President Isaias Afwerki's government in Asmara has in the past denied any involvement, while the Abiy administration in Addis Ababa has repeatedly said it is restoring law and order.
Abiy's office said in a statement on Wednesday that it would investigate credible allegations of abuses and bring perpetrators to account. The state-appointed national human rights commission was also investigating and was willing to collaborate with relevant U.N. agencies, it said.
Bachelet's statement said more than 136 rape cases had been reported in hospitals in east Tigray between December and January, with indications of many more unreported.
""Reliable sources have shared information about the killing of eight protestors by security forces between 9 and 10 February in Adigrat, Mekelle, Shire and Wukro,"" the statement added.
Indiscriminate shelling occurred in November in Mekelle, Humera and Adigrat, while mass killings had been reported in Axum and Dengelat, the U.N. rights boss said.
Amnesty International last week accused Eritrean forces of killing hundreds of civilians over 24 hours in Axum city last year. Eritrea denied that, but Ethiopia's rights body also described such killings, though with fewer details, in a rare acknowledgment from the Ethiopian side that Eritrean troops have participated in the conflict.

Hundreds of civilians were also massacred in Mai Kadra town early in the fighting last November, rights groups say.

1176,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 07:55AM ET</span>",Saudi prince pushes on with $500 billion megacity as U.S. points the finger over Khashoggi killing,"By Saeed Azhar
DUBAI (Reuters) - It seems an unlikely vision, a megacity in the desert with no cars or roads, all run by machines that can recognise your face.
Yet preparations for NEOM, the $500 billion signature project in Prince Mohammed bin Salman's drive to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy, are well underway. The organisation behind the development, expected to be close to the size of Belgium when it is completed, will hire 700 people this year, according to Simon Ainslie, the venture's chief operating officer.
While NEOM is being sold as a vision of a brighter future, international investors have yet to bite.
The scale of the project is vast and the region already has well-established transport and business hubs in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Qatar. The development is also inextricably linked to the Crown Prince, who as de facto leader of the kingdom has drawn ire over Saudi's war in Yemen and his own alleged links to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
A U.S. intelligence report released last week concluded the prince approved an operation to ""capture or kill"" Khashoggi, who had criticised Saudi policies in columns for the Washington Post. Saudi officials deny this and have rejected the report's findings.
Analysts say the report is unlikely to change investor sentiment towards Saudi Arabia in the absence of U.S. action against the prince.
""They had expected sort of a bigger push back from the (Biden) administration but if this is it then the signal is fairly weak,"" said Neil Quilliam, managing director at Azure Strategy, a Middle East-focused consultancy
""So I don’t see this as being a major impediment to most companies seeking opportunities in the kingdom.” [L5N2L06I7]
Quilliam said there was some skepticism about so-called 'giga projects', citing the King Abdullah Economic City project in the early 2000s, that never really took off.
The Saudi government's media office and NEOM did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the status of NEOM in the wake of the U.S. report. 
Before the report was released, NEOM said that the project had attracted domestic and international interest.
""NEOM is in discussions with several companies across diverse industries that are keen to be involved,"" it said in a statement.
NEOM was publicly launched in 2017 but large-scale construction of the city has yet to begin. The project currently employs over 750 people, 500 of them hired last year. 
The murder of Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul in 2018 had already caused an international outcry prompting some people at the time to withdraw from the advisory board of NEOM.
The list of current members is not publicly available and NEOM declined to say who sits on it.
COGNITIVE CITY
Funding for NEOM will initially come from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, according to two financial sources close to the matter.
""Investors will start getting interested when the core infrastructure is operating so they are not taking absolute green-field risk,"" said a financial source familiar with the project.
In 2017, Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group CEO Masayoshi Son said the company would work with Saudi Arabia on the development of NEOM.
Softbank and Son did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on what their current investment plans are for NEOM.
The Saudi sovereign fund PIF has invested around $45 billion in Softbank's inaugural $100 billion technology fund.
The PIF said in an email that its role on major projects was to act as a long-term cornerstone investor to ensure ""that capital allocated to all its projects, including NEOM, generate sustainable returns that generate long-term shareholder value"".
NEOM's flagship zero-carbon project ""The Line"" envisages a city of 1 million people run by smart technology with facial recognition and 5G networks as standard.
""We're fundamentally building the world's first cognitive city,"" Joseph Bradley, NEOM's head of technology and digital and a former CISCO executive, told Reuters, adding that an operating system known as NEOS aimed to seek consent to use data from 90% of residents.
This year's hiring spree will span a range of professions from lawyers, accountants and engineers, to specialist areas such as advanced robotics and adventure sports, according to Ainslie, who was hired in 2019 from  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)
NEOM officials say building would start soon on 'The Line', a car-free, road-free city within NEOM, without specifying a date.

NEOM said in a statement that work had begun on surveys and temporary infrastructure, and that permanent works would start this year with the first phase to be completed by 2025.

1177,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 07:00AM ET</span>",Israel's Netanyahu bets all on vaccine success to secure election win,"By Jeffrey Heller
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Heading into Israel's fourth election in two years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hoping the success of his government's COVID-19 vaccination programme will also serve as a political lifeline.
The 71-year-old conservative, who is on trial for corruption and accused by critics of mismanaging the pandemic, has made the vaccine front and centre of his campaign speeches, social media posts and interviews.
But with opinion polls predicting no clear winner in the March 23 ballot and challengers on Netanyahu's right poised to siphon some of his traditional supporters, it is not clear if his strategy will pay off.
""We are the only ones who can succeed (in emerging from the pandemic) because I brought millions of vaccine doses,"" Netanyahu said in an interview with Israel's Channel 13 TV last week.
""Thirty world leaders called me. They told me, 'we tip our hat to the way you ran things, with the health care services,'"" he said.
More than half the Israeli population have been given a first dose of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) /BioNTech vaccine, and nearly 40% have received both shots, far more than in any other country in the world.
Netanyahu has said the economy should be back to full swing by April 5. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi)
But Israel's longest-serving leader is under growing pressure. In addition to his indictment at home on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, all of which he denies, the International Criminal Court has announced an investigation into war crimes in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories during his tenure. 
And opponents, saying any Israeli leader would have scrambled to secure vaccines, note that the government had to impose three national lockdowns to try to stem spiking infection rates, and that some 6,000 people died of the virus.
Israeli voters have also been feeling the economic strain: official figures showed unemployment at 18% in January.
Ayala Hasson, a Channel 13 news anchor, said Netanyahu's focus on vaccinations stemmed partly from watching his ally Donald Trump's defeat in the U.S. presidential election.
""Netanyahu looked very carefully at what happened in the United States and he saw that Trump lost his presidency because of the COVID issue,"" Hasson told Reuters. ""So he thinks it's going to help him, this matter (of vaccines).""
But she said Netanyahu's theme resonated mainly among those who already support him, and ""the majority of voters are already decided.""
VACCINATION CAMPAIGN
Netanyahu's vaccination push drew praise among Israelis interviewed on a Tel Aviv street, but some said it wasn't enough to persuade them to vote for ""Bibi"", who has been in power continuously since 2009.
""I think it's time for a change in Israel and we need someone new, despite the great job he did with the vaccinations,"" said Itay Levy, 21, a software engineer.
Stephen Segal, 32, who owns a coffee business, said there were more important aspects of the coronavirus crisis.
""Did (Netanyahu) handle the economy well? Did he handle the number of infections? I struggled personally during the pandemic - a lot of other people did - and so this is really what's going to determine my vote,"" he said.
Many secular Israelis accuse Netanyahu of ignoring lockdown violations within the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community - whose political leaders are key partners in his governing coalition - while enforcing restrictions elsewhere.
Israel's vaccine supplies were ensured, Netanyahu said, through numerous phone calls he made to Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, and an offer to provide the company with real-world data.
His ""proven leadership"" would ensure additional vaccine supplies, he says.
But on a popular morning drive-time show on Israel's Kan public radio this week, the familiar sound bite drew only exasperation.
""I'm bringing vaccines for all Israeli citizens,"" Netanyahu began.

""Vaccinations again? Enough,"" the radio host interjected.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is planning to extend its export authorisation scheme for COVID-19 vaccines to the end of June, two EU sources told Reuters on Thursday, in a move that could reignite tensions with countries who rely on shots made in the EU.
The mechanism was set up at the end of January as a reaction to vaccine makers' announcements of delays in the deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines to the EU.
It is due to expire at the end of March, but the European Commission wants to extend it through June, the two officials said.
""The Commission will propose its extension into June. And that was greeted by the member states with approval, not necessarily enthusiasm, but there is a feeling that we still need that mechanism,"" one senior EU diplomat said.
The second official added that at a meeting with EU diplomats on Wednesday, many countries supported the measure, including heavyweights Germany and France. 
The EU Commission was not immediately available for a comment.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has also called for sanctions on companies that do not respect their contractual obligations with the EU.
When the EU's export control mechanism was introduced in late January it triggered an outcry from importing countries who feared their vaccine supplies might have been hampered.
Under the scheme, companies must get an authorisation before exporting COVID-19 shots, and may have export requests denied if they do not respect their supply commitments with the EU.
However, the EU has authorised all requests for export since the scheme's debut on Jan. 30 to Feb. 26, which amounted to 150 requests for millions of shots to 29 countries, including Britain, the United Arab Emirates and Canada, an EU Commission spokeswoman said.
She added, however, that at least one request was withdrawn by an exporting company. She declined to elaborate.
Export requests mostly concern the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine which is manufactured in Belgium. AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) shots have also been exported from the EU.
Since Jan. 30 more than 8 million vaccines were shipped from the EU to Britain, a third EU source said.
Britain has so far prevented the export of AstraZeneca vaccines to the EU, using a UK-first clause in its supply contract with the Anglo-Swedish firm, EU officials have said.

The United States also has regulations that effectively ban vaccine exports, the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference last week.

The incidents followed the bloodiest day so far since the military overthrew the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, with the United Nations special envoy on Burma saying 38 people had been killed on Wednesday.
The United Nations human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, called on the security forces to halt what she called their ""vicious crackdown on peaceful protesters"".
At least 54 people had been killed in total but the actual toll could be much higher, she said. More than 1,700 people had been arrested, including 29 journalists.
""Myanmar's military must stop murdering and jailing protesters,"" Bachelet said in a statement.
Activists said they refused to accept military rule and were determined to press for the release of the detained Suu Kyi and recognition of her victory in a November election.
""We know that we can always get shot and killed with live bullets but there is no meaning to staying alive under the junta,"" activist Maung Saungkha told Reuters.
Police opened fire and used tear gas to break up protests in Yangon and the central town of Monywa, witnesses said. Police also fired in the town of Pathein, to the west of Yangon, and used tear gas in the eastern town of Taunggyi, media reported.
In Yangon, crowds of protesters soon assembled again to chant slogans and sing.
Big crowds also gathered peacefully for rallies elsewhere, including the second city of Mandalay and in the historic temple town of Bagan, where hundreds marched carrying pictures of Suu Kyi and a banner saying: ""Free our leader"", witnesses said.
Hundreds of people attended the funeral of a 19-year-old woman shot dead in Mandalay on Wednesday, who was photographed wearing a T-shirt that read ""Everything will be OK""..
Earlier on Thursday, five warplanes made several low passes in formation over Mandalay, residents said, in what appeared to be a show of military might.
On Wednesday, police and soldiers opened fire with live rounds with little warning in several cities and towns, witnesses said.
""Myanmar's security forces now seem intent on breaking the back of the anti-coup movement through wanton violence and sheer brutality,"" said Richard Weir, a researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The group also mentioned an incident caught on camera-phone footage in which a man in police custody appeared to have been shot in the back.
A spokesman for the ruling military council did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.
'FEW FRIENDS'
Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party said in a statement that flags would fly at half mast at its offices to commemorate the dead.
The U.N. special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, said on Wednesday she had warned deputy military chief Soe Win that the army was likely to face strong measures from some countries and isolation in retaliation for the coup.
""The answer was: 'We are used to sanctions, and we survived',"" she told reporters in New York. ""When I also warned they will go (into) isolation, the answer was: 'We have to learn to walk with only few friends'.""
The U.N. Security Council is due to discuss the situation on Friday in a closed meeting, diplomats said.
U.S. State Department said Washington was ""appalled"" by the violence and was evaluating how to respond.
The United States has told China it expects it to play a constructive role, it said. China has declined to condemn the coup which its state media called a ""major cabinet reshuffle"".
The turmoil has alarmed Myanmar's Southeast Asian neighbours but an effort by some of them to encourage dialogue has come to nothing.
Singapore, the biggest foreign investor in Myanmar in recent years, advised its nationals to consider leaving as soon as they could due to the rising violence while it was still possible to do so.
Three Myanmar police constables crossed Myanmar's northwestern border to defect to India after refusing to obey military orders, an Indian police official said.
The military justified the coup by saying its complaints of voter fraud in the Nov. 8 vote were ignored. Suu Kyi's party won by a landslide, earning a second term. The election commission said the vote was fair.
Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing has pledged to hold new elections but given no time frame.

Suu Kyi, 75, has been held incommunicado since the coup but appeared at a court hearing via video conferencing this week and looked in good health, a lawyer said.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron will spare the Paris region a weekend lockdown for now, determined to keep France's economy as open as possible, even though the death rate from COVID-19 is still creeping up.
Two government sources aware of Macron's thinking said Prime Minister Jean Castex would on Thursday announce a weekend lockdown for the northerly Pas-de-Calais area, like that already imposed on the French Riviera, but not for the capital and its surroundings.
Macron is hoping to avoid another setback for the economy in the expectation that France's coronavirus vaccination programme, which has targeted the most vulnerable but been slow, will gradually reduce the numbers falling sick and dying.
""If we can avoid a weekend lockdown in Paris, we will try to do so,"" Macron told ministers, according to a third source. ""Every weekend gained is important.""
A spokesperson for Castex said that a lockdown, even if only at the weekend, should be a ""last resort"". The situation in Paris will be reviewed next week.
While some neighbours such as Britain and Germany have resorted to sweeping national lockdowns to fight a resurgence in the virus spurred by new variants, France has opted for a less severe nightly curfew and the closure of bars, restaurants and entertainment venues.
As Britain now charts a course out of lockdown as new infections fall sharply, France has not yet turned the corner.
France registered 26,788 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday. Cases have been rising at a steady weekly rate of just above 4% since early January, although this is far below rises of more than 20% seen before and during a nationwide lockdown in November.
In Ile-de-France, a region of 12 million people centred on Paris, there were 388 COVID-related deaths in hospitals in the week to March 3, compared to 379 and 374 in the preceding weeks.

The weekend lockdown in Pas-de-Calais will remain in place for several weeks, one of the officials said.

Digital rights group Myanmar ICT for Development (MIDO) said it had found over 800 pro-military videos that menaced protesters at a time of increasing bloodshed - with 38 protesters killed on Wednesday alone according to the United Nations.
""It's just the tip of the iceberg,"" said MIDO executive director Htaike Htaike Aung, who noted that there's ""hundreds"" of videos of uniformed soldiers and police on the app.
A spokesman for the army and junta did not respond to a request for comment.
One video from late February reviewed by Reuters shows a man in army fatigues aiming an assault rifle at the camera and addressing protesters: ""I will shoot in your fucking faces... and I'm using real bullets.""
""I am going to patrol the whole city tonight and I will shoot whoever I see... If you want to become a martyr, I will fulfil your wish.""
Reuters was unable to contact him or the other uniformed men who appear in the TikTok videos or to verify that they are in the armed forces. 
TikTok is the latest social media platform to suffer a proliferation of menacing content or hate speech in Myanmar.
U.S. tech giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has now banned all pages linked to Myanmar's army - and has itself been banned.
TikTok said in a statement: ""We have clear Community Guidelines that state we do not allow content that incites violence or misinformation that causes harm... As it relates to Myanmar, we have been and continue to promptly remove all content that incites violence or spreads misinformation, and are aggressively monitoring to remove any such content that violates our guidelines.""
TikTok's policies forbid displays of guns unless they are in ""safe environments"".
Reuters reviewed over a dozen videos where uniformed men, sometimes brandishing guns, threatened to harm protesters who are calling for the reversal of the coup and the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
Some videos had tens of thousands of views. Those reviewed by Reuters were taken down this week. Some used hashtags relating to U.S celebrities.
Already growing fast in Myanmar, TikTok saw a strong rise in downloads after the military banned Facebook last month. It is in the top 20 most downloaded apps in Myanmar, according to industry data. 
Facebook, which remains popular in Myanmar despite the ban, has toughened its scrutiny of content since being accused of helping to fan atrocities against the Rohingya Muslim minority in 2017.

Researchers like Htaike say they believe the military is now attempting to grow its presence on other platforms.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Britain, France and Germany have scrapped a U.S.-backed plan for the U.N. nuclear watchdog's board to criticise Iran for scaling back cooperation with the agency, diplomats said on Thursday, amid concerns about efforts to revive Iran's nuclear deal.
The European powers, all parties to the 2015 nuclear deal, have been lobbying for the International Atomic Energy Agency's 35-nation Board of Governors to adopt a resolution at this week's quarterly meeting expressing concern at Iran's latest breaches of the deal and calling on it to undo them.
However, Iran has bristled at the prospect, threatening to end a recent agreement with the IAEA that limits the impact of its latest moves and enables monitoring of its facilities to continue in a black-box-type arrangement for up to three months.
Three diplomats who follow the IAEA closely said the so-called E3 had scrapped their plan for a resolution.
""Cooler heads are prevailing,"" said one diplomat from a country on the board that had been sceptical about the proposed resolution. Other countries had expressed concern that a resolution would undermine attempts to rescue the deal.
Separately but almost simultaneously, the IAEA said its chief Rafael Grossi would hold a news conference at midday (1100 GMT). Two of the diplomats said Grossi had told the IAEA board he plans to hold technical discussions with Iran next month.
The Europeans' draft resolution circulated earlier this week also expressed ""deep concern"" at Iran's failure to explain uranium particles found at three old sites, including two that the IAEA first reported on last week.

One diplomat said that would be the subject of the technical discussions, and if Iran's cooperation was insufficient the plan for a resolution could be revived at the next quarterly board meeting in June.

Angel, also known as Kyal Sin, was shot in the head and killed in the city of Mandalay on Wednesday while wearing a shirt bearing the message ""Everything will be OK"".
Mourners, many of them young like her, filed past her open coffin and sang protest songs, raised a three-fingered salute of defiance and chanted slogans against the Feb. 1 military coup that has plunged the country into turmoil.
Angel was one of 38 people killed on Wednesday, according to a United Nations tally. A spokesman for the junta did not respond to a request for comment on the killings.
Sai Tun, 32, who attended the funeral, said he could not come to terms with what had happened to her.
""We feel so angry about their inhuman behaviour and really sad at the same time,"" he told Reuters by telephone.
""We'll fight dictatorship until the end. We must prevail.""
Despite the slogan on her shirt, Angel was aware of the risk as she headed out to the protest, posting details of her blood group, a contact number and a request to donate her body in the event of her death.
The phrase on the shirt quickly went viral on social media among opponents of the coup.
More than 50 people have now been killed as the military struggles to impose its authority, in particular on a generation that has grown up in recent years under a government led by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi.
The military, which ruled for nearly 50 years until it began stepping back from politics a decade ago, said an election Suu Kyi won in a landslide in November was marred by fraud. The election commission dismissed the complaint of fraud. 
In the central town of Monywa, family and friends mourned the death of young poet T Z Win, who was also killed on Wednesday. 

The day before he was killed he posted a poem on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) with the line: ""The louder the song of the youth, The more the whole world will be cleansed"".

LONDON/BELFAST (Reuters) - Northern Irish loyalist paramilitary groups have told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson they are temporarily withdrawing support for the 1998 peace agreement due to concerns over the Brexit deal.
While the groups pledged ""peaceful and democratic"" opposition to the deal, such a stark warning increases the pressure on Johnson, his Irish counterpart Micheál Martin and the European Union over Brexit.
Northern Ireland’s 1998 peace deal, known as the Belfast or Good Friday Agreement, ended three decades of violence between mostly Catholic nationalists fighting for a united Ireland and mostly Protestant unionists, or loyalists, who want Northern Ireland to stay part of the United Kingdom. 
The loyalist paramilitaries including the Ulster Volunteer Force, Ulster Defence Association and Red Hand Commando said they were concerned about the disruption to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland due to the Brexit deal.
""The loyalist groupings are herewith withdrawing their support for the Belfast Agreement,"" they said in a March 3 letter to Johnson from Loyalist Communities Council chairman David Campbell. 
Reuters has seen a copy of the letter. A similar letter has been sent to the Irish leader and copies were sent to the European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic.
The paramilitary groups said they were determined that unionist opposition to the Northern Irish Protocol was peaceful but added a warning.
""Please do not underestimate the strength of feeling on this issue right across the unionist family,"" the letter said.
""If you or the EU is not prepared to honour the entirety of the agreement then you will be responsible for the permanent destruction of the agreement,"" it said.
They said they would not return to the deal until their rights were restored and the Northern Irish Protocol - part of the 2020 Brexit Treaty - was amended to ensure unfettered trade between Britain and Northern Ireland.
But, they said, their core disagreement was more fundamental: that Britain, Ireland and the European Union had in the Northern Irish Protocol breached their commitments to the 1998 peace deal and the two communities. 
Johnson's office did not immediately comment on the letter but referred Reuters to an earlier statement by his Brexit pointman, David Frost, who did not address the letter.
PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
Preserving the delicate peace in Northern Ireland without allowing the United Kingdom a back door into the EU’s markets through the 310-mile (500 km) UK-Irish land border was one of the most difficult issues of the Brexit divorce talks.
The loyalist groups abandoned the armed struggle in 1998 and residual violence since the accord has largely been carried out by dissident nationalist groups who opposed the peace deal.
Since Brexit proper on Jan. 1, 2021, Northern Ireland has had problems importing a range of goods from Britain - which unionists, or loyalists, say divides up the United Kingdom and so is unacceptable.
The European Union promised legal action on Wednesday after the British government unilaterally extended a grace period for checks on food imports to Northern Ireland, a move Brussels said violated the terms of Britain's divorce deal.
Ireland said Britain was behaving inappropriately.
""For the second time in the course of a few months, the British government has threatened to breach international law,"" Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told Virgin Media television, referring to a similar unilateral move last year that London eventually dropped.
""This is not the appropriate behaviour of a respectable country, quite frankly.""

Joe Biden, while campaigning in the presidential election last year, bluntly warned Britain that it must honour the 1998 peace agreement as it withdrew from the European Union or there would be no separate U.S. trade deal.

Nearly 153,000 people have applied for vaccinations since Sunday when the North African country opened online registration, the cabinet said in a statement.
Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country with more than 100 million, has prepared 40 vaccination centres and plans to increase that number after the arrival of more vaccine batches, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said.
Egypt received 350,000 doses of a coronavirus vaccine‮ ‬ developed by China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) in two batches since December, in addition to 50,000 doses of a vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) in February.
It is hoping to receive vaccines through the COVAX facility, a global initiative aimed at providing equitable distribution of vaccines, in the coming weeks.
On Feb. 24, the Egyptian Drug Authority approved Russia's Sputnik V vaccine for emergency use. Egypt's Prime Speed Medical Services said it had obtained the right to provide Sputnik V in Egypt in a statement to the stock exchange, without giving details. 
Egypt began vaccinating frontline medical staff against COVID-19 on Jan. 24 using the Chinese vaccine.
Those getting the Sinopharm jab have a second dose after 21 days while those who receive the AstraZeneca vaccine wait 12 weeks for the second dose, said Health Minister Hala Zayed.
As of Wednesday, Egypt had confirmed 184,168 coronavirus cases, including 10,822 deaths, since the start of the pandemic.

However, health officials say the real number is likely far higher due to a relatively low rate of coronavirus testing and the exclusion of private test results.

Late on Wednesday, gunshots and chaos erupted during what should have been the joyous return of 279 schoolgirls abducted by gunmen from their boarding school last week.
The government secured the release of the girls on Tuesday, but they had been undergoing medical checks and treatment.
At least three people were shot, but it was not clear by whom. A Reuters witness saw police firing tear gas at a group of protesters outside the school, and soldiers shooting into the air, after impatient parents burst in and grabbed their children to take them home.
Zamfara state spokesman Sulaiman Tunau Anka called it ""unfortunate civil disobedience"" and said the governor had imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in the town, Jangebe, to prevent a further breach of the peace.
Anka also said market activities would be suspended until further notice, as authorities had uncovered ""strong evidence"" that these activities had aided and abetted bandits. He did not elaborate.
""The state government is poised to ensure safety of lives and properties of its citizens at all cost,"" Anka said. 
Earlier this week, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered a massive military deployment to Zamfara, banned mining and imposed a no-fly zone in the state.
The Jangebe abduction was the third mass school kidnapping in northern Nigeria since December. 

The kidnappings for ransom are the latest manifestation of years of festering banditry that has rendered large swathes of northwest Nigeria lawless.

Philip was admitted to hospital on Feb. 16 after he felt unwell, to receive treatment for an unspecified, but not COVID-19-related, infection.
On Monday, he was transferred to a different hospital in central London, with the palace saying at the time that he would have heart tests and continue to be treated for the infection.
""The Duke of Edinburgh yesterday underwent a successful procedure for a pre-existing heart condition at St Bartholomew’s Hospital,"" the palace said, using Philip's formal title.
""His Royal Highness will remain in hospital for treatment, rest and recuperation for a number of days,"" the statement said.

The queen, 94, has remained at Windsor Castle west of London, where the couple have been staying during the coronavirus pandemic, and last week continued to carry out her official duties by video. 
She and Philip have received their first COVID-19 vaccine dose.
Greek-born Philip, who turns 100 in June, has required hospital treatment several times in the last decade for a recurrence of a bladder infection.

""This is not the appropriate behaviour of a respectable country, quite frankly."" 
The fate of Northern Ireland was the most bitterly contested issue during Britain's Brexit negotiations, with London ultimately agreeing to leave the British-ruled region aligned with the EU's single market for goods, requiring checks on some items arriving there from elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
That has already caused difficulty for businesses which say they have had trouble bringing in supplies, and more checks were meant to come into force when a grace period ends on March 31. Many business groups welcomed the move on Wednesday.
Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney warned that the European Union is not for the first time likely to see Britain as a negotiating partner it ""simply can't trust"".
He said it also undermined Irish attempts to convince Brussels of the need to make some changes to the Northern Irish protocol and took aim at Britain's new minister overseeing EU ties, David Frost.
""Before Lord Frost had even spoken in detail to (EU Commission Vice President) Maros Sefcovic in his new role, this was announced. To say that is disrespectful, would be an understatement,"" Coveney told national broadcaster RTE.

""Vice President Sefcovic has shown a real willingness to try to solve the problems of the protocol and to make a case in the European Commission, European Parliament and Council and was making progress on that. For him to be undermined in this way by the British government is deeply unhelpful.""

Ressa, a Time Magazine Person of the Year in 2018 for fighting media intimidation, is facing several government lawsuits that have stoked international concern about harassment of journalists in the Philippines, a country once seen as a standard bearer for press freedom in Asia.
Speaking to reporters after testifying for two and a half hours in Manila, Ressa asked the government to allow journalists to work freely and independently. ""We're here to work with you, and you will want us to do that,"" she said.
Ressa, 57, chief executive of the news site Rappler (www.rappler.com), was convicted of libel in June 2020 and sentenced to up to six years in prison, a ruling widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms under Duterte's increasingly popular authoritarianism. She was freed on bail.
Her court appearance on Thursday is over accusations that Rappler falsified tax returns by omitting the proceeds of a sale of depositary receipts to foreign investors, which later became the securities regulator's basis to revoke its licence to operate. 
The securities regulator alleges that Rappler allowed foreigners to illegally own shares in a domestic media firm, a charge it denies. Rappler is still operating pending its appeal against its license being revoked.
Ressa, the last witness to be presented by the defence in the tax evasion lawsuits, said she decided to take the stand because ""no one knows (the company) better"". 
""I felt good afterwards. I was happy to talk to respond to the charges,"" she said. ""If the government believes that they can intimidate me, no, I won't allow it.""

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque has repeatedly said Duterte supported freedom of speech even as the mercurial leader has publicly lashed out at Rappler, calling it a ""fake news outlet"" sponsored by American spies.

Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar will hold talks with his Bangladeshi counterpart on water sharing, trade and border issues, said two Indian officials in New Delhi.
""Of course, the Rohingya refugee issue will come up during the Indian minister's day-long visit but the prime agenda will remain around Modi's upcoming visit,"" said a senior foreign ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
Last month, Indian coastguards rescued 81 Rohingya Muslims whose boat was drifting in the Andaman Sea for over two weeks after they left Bangladesh, home to over a million Rohingya refugees from Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Eight people on the boat had already died of dehydration.
The fate of the refugees remains unclear as India, so far, has not allowed their entry into its territory and wants Bangladesh to take them back. 
But Bangladesh Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen last week told Reuters that his government expects India, the closest country, or Myanmar, the Rohingyas' country of origin, to accept the 81 survivors.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya were forced to flee their homeland after a crackdown by Myanmar's military in 2017. Myanmar denies accusations of genocide and says the army was fighting a legitimate counter-insurgency campaign.
Aid agencies are demanding that governments stop passing the buck and pluck the 81 survivors immediately from the Andaman sea. 
India has in recent weeks provided two million doses of COVID-19 vaccines shots to Bangladesh and could use that goodwill to press Dhaka to accept the refugees. 

Modi is visiting Dhaka as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of Bangladesh's independence later this month.

Khogyani did not name the doctor but said she worked in the maternity ward of a private hospital. 
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
A wave of shootings and small bombs attached to vehicles or planted on the side of a road have targeted journalists, civil society workers and mid-level government employees in recent months.
The government and some foreign powers have blamed Taliban insurgents for many of the attacks and say the militant group is using the tactics to instill fear while avoiding large-scale civilian casualties. The Taliban denies involvement.
The Taliban and Afghan government are holding peace talks in Doha, though progress has slowed while U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration reviews its plans for the peace process and the withdrawal of troops. 
On Tuesday, three female media employees of a private TV station, aged between 18 to 20 were shot dead on their way home in Jalalabad city. The attack was later claimed by the Islamic State militant group.

The spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition that has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement for six years did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in a Twitter post that the attack took place at dawn using a winged Quds-2 missile and had struck its target, without elaborating. 
He posted an image with coordinates of what appeared to be a petroleum products distribution plant in Jeddah used for domestic supplies that the Houthis struck with a Quds-2 missile in November 2020. Military experts estimated then that the missile was fired from about 700 km (430 miles) away in Houthi-controlled territory.
Aramco said then that the attack on the North Jeddah Bulk Plant hit a storage tank but did not affect supplies.
The movement, which controls northern Yemen, has struck Saudi energy assets in the past. Last November, the Saudi energy ministry said a limited fire broke out near a floating platform belonging to the Jazan oil products terminal after a foiled attack using explosive-laden boats in the southern Red Sea.
The Houthis have recently stepped up cross-border drone and missile attacks on Saudi cities, mostly targeting southern Saudi Arabia. The coalition says it intercepts most attacks.
On Thursday, the coalition destroyed a Houthi ballistic missile launched towards Jazan and an armed drone launched towards Khamis Mushait, both cities in the south of the kingdom, state media reported. 
The Houthi's Sarea said in a separate Twitter post that the Khamis Mushait attack targeted a military site.
The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Houthis ousted the internationally recognised government from power in the capital, Sanaa.
The United States and United Nations have renewed peace efforts as fighting also intensified in Yemen's gas-rich Marib region. The U.S. Treasury Department imposed new sanctions on Tuesday on two Houthi military leaders.
The conflict is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis deny being puppets of Tehran and say they are fighting a corrupt system.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The death of South Korea's first known transgender soldier, who was discharged last year for undergoing gender reassignment surgery, sparked calls from advocacy groups and activists for better protections and acknowledgement of transgender residents.
Byun Hui-su, 23, who was a staff sergeant before being discharged, was found dead by emergency officials at her home in the city of Cheongju, south of Seoul, on Wednesday.
""Byun's death resonated even more with the public because the military and this society refused to acknowledge the change,"" Rainbow Action Against Sexual-Minority Discrimination of Korea, an umbrella association of group of 40 sexual minority groups, said in a statement. 
Byun's bravery in coming forward had inspired and empowered others, the group said.
A woman who said she had been Byun's friend since they attended a military high school together seven years ago, told Reuters that Feb. 28 would have been Byun's last day in the military if she had been allowed to stay in service.
""She was destined to be a soldier. A military nerd, she was so knowledgeable about all things military, not just Korean troops but those in other countries, and worked so hard to restart her service,"" said Kim, requesting only her surname be given due to privacy issues.
Kim said Byun had been jobless as all her applications were rejected since she went public when the military discharged her last year after having the operation in Thailand. 
Byun sued the Army, saying she still hoped to continue her service, and the first hearing had been set for April.
“I want to show everyone that I can also be one of the great soldiers who protect this country,” Byun said at the time, breaking down in tears as she described her decision to undergo surgery and the subsequent clash with the military.
An initial military comment that it was not in a position to say anything regarding “the news of the death of a civilian” drew swift criticism on social media, and on Thursday a spokesperson offered official condolences, calling Byun's death ""unfortunate.""
The official said, however, that the military had still not had any detailed discussion on its policies toward transgender soldiers.
The case triggered debate in South Korea's LBGT community over how transgender members of the military are treated in a country that requires all able-bodied men to serve for around two years.
Prime Minister Chung Se-kyun offered condolences when asked at a regular briefing about any plans for institutional changes regarding military service for transgenders, but said further discussions were needed. 
The National Human Rights Commission issued a statement honouring Byun's ""fight against deep-rooted discrimination and hatred"", and vowing efforts to improve the system.

(Reuters) - New Zealand police said on Thursday they have arrested two people following a threat made against the mosques that were the scene of mass murder by a white supremacist nearly two years ago.
Police said an online threat was made earlier this week against the Al Noor mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre, which were targeted in New Zealand's most deadly shooting in 2019.
No information about the nature of the threat was supplied and neither suspect has been named. No charges have yet been laid, police said.
""Any messages of hate or people wanting to cause harm in our community will not be tolerated - it's not the Kiwi way,"" said John Price, Canterbury District Commander Superintendent in an emailed statement.
New Zealand is heightened alert ahead of the March 15 anniversary of Christchurch attack. Armed with high-capacity semi-automatic weapons, Australian Brenton Tarrant killed 51 people and injured dozens more after opening fire on worshippers at the two mosques, livestreaming the attacks on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) before being arrested.
In August, Tarrant was sentenced to life in prison without parole, the first time New Zealand confined anyone for the rest of their life.

1200,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 01:05AM ET</span>",Analysis: Biden faces calls to jumpstart North Korea talks with more pragmatic goals,"By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - With U.S. policy toward North Korea in limbo as the new administration in Washington conducts a months-long policy review, former officials and experts are sparring over whether to shift focus from seeking the North's full denuclearisation.
The administration of President Joe Biden says its review of North Korea policy will be finished in coming months, before announcing its plans for handling a rolling crisis that has bedevilled generations of U.S. presidents.
In his first major speech outlining Biden's top foreign policy priorities, Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday focused on China, only mentioning North Korea as one of several countries that present ""serious challenges"".
The administration's interim national security strategic guidance released later that day said Biden would ""empower our diplomats to work to reduce the threat posed by North Korea’s growing nuclear and missile programs"" while standing shoulder to shoulder with allies like South Korea and Japan, but did not elaborate.
The strategy's talk of threat reduction is notable and potentially positive if the administration embraces that as a short-term focus while retaining denuclearisation as a longer-term aspirational goal, said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
""Threat reduction suggests a realistic appraisal of the situation on the Korean Peninsula - namely, that North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities need to be addressed short of total disarmament,"" he said.
Regardless of the approach taken, analysts and former officials say it would be a mistake to wait for North Korea to make the first move, such as a long-range missile or nuclear test, and that Biden stands the best chance of making some progress by being proactive. 
""One key lesson we’ve learned over time is the longer we kick this can down the road, the more limited our options become,"" the U.S.-based 38 North think tank said in a recent report. 
Among the proposals being raised by experts are limited arms control arrangements in exchange for easing sanctions on Pyongyang, establishing better diplomatic ties, conducting exchanges, and declaring an official end to the state of war that has technically existed since the 1950-1953 Korean War.
Several former members of Donald Trump's administration, however, have called for Biden to double down on sanctions and the threat of military action to pressure North Korea into giving up its nuclear weapons, arguing that his ""maximum pressure"" campaign was never fully enforced or given time to work.
Many of these ideas were debated prominently when Trump's historic meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un raised the prospect that relations between the two old enemies could change.
But no significant breakthroughs were made and a growing number of observers say it is time the United States tries something new. 
ARMS CONTROL VS DENUCLEARISATION
Earlier this week, analysts at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) said commercial satellite imagery showed North Korea recently built a structure over a pair of underground tunnels near Yongdoktong, where it is believed to store nuclear weapons, highlighting potential progress in expanding the North's arsenal.
Last month, Blinken told the United Nations-backed Conference on Disarmament the United States ""remains focused on the denuclearisation of North Korea.""
38 North argued smaller steps could help reduce tensions and risks of conflict. Measures could include arms control agreements, scaling back military exercises with South Korea, building diplomatic ties, and declaring an end to the Korean War, while also working closely with allies and strengthening deterrence.
""The goal of denuclearisation should be maintained but reframed in a more realistic way that seeks to secure achievable limits on North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities in the near term,"" the report concluded.
Trump’s former national security, John Bolton, blasted those ideas in a recent op-ed for Bloomberg Opinion, arguing the United States needs to keep military options on the table. He feared Biden would adopt ""weak arms control and nonproliferation diplomacy"".
Another of Trump's former national security advisors, H.R. McMaster, told a U.S. congressional committee on Tuesday Biden should not to accede to initial agreements and payoffs just to get to the negotiating table.
""Acknowledging North Korea as a limited nuclear power and pursuing a strategy of containment is not acceptable,"" he said.
A former adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in argued the goal of denuclearisation does not need to be dropped, but the United States needs to be more flexible in making initial deals with Pyongyang. 

""There’s unlikely to be any progress if they adopt a cognitive frame of 'crime and punishment,' Moon Chung-in wrote in a op-ed for the Hankyoreh newspaper.

1201,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 12:51AM ET</span>",SpaceX Starship rocket prototype nails landing... then blows up,"(Reuters) - The third time appeared to be the charm for Elon Musk's Starship rocket - until it wasn't.
The latest heavy-duty launch vehicle prototype from SpaceX soared flawlessly into the sky in a high-altitude test blast-off on Wednesday from Boca Chica, Texas, then flew itself back to Earth to achieve the first upright landing for a Starship model.
But the triumph was short-lived. Listing slightly to one side as an automated fire-suppression system trained a stream of water on flames still burning at the base of the rocket, the spacecraft blew itself to pieces about eight minutes after touchdown.
It was the third such landing attempt to end in a fireball after an otherwise successful test flight for the Starship, being developed by SpaceX to carry humans and 100 tons of cargo on future missions to the moon and Mars.
For Musk, the billionaire SpaceX founder who also heads the electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, the outcome was mixed news.
The Starship SN10 came far closer to achieving a safe, vertical touchdown than two previous models - SN8 in December and SN9 in February. In a tweet responding to tempered congratulations from an admirer of his work, Musk replied, ""RIP SN10, honorable discharge.""
The video feed provided by SpaceX on the company's YouTube channel cut off moments after the landing. But separate fan feeds streamed over the same social media platform showed an explosion suddenly erupting at the base of the rocket, hurling the SN10 into the air before it crashed to the ground and became engulfed in flames.
The complete Starship rocket, which will stand 394-feet (120 metres) tall when mated with its super-heavy first-stage booster, is SpaceX's next-generation fully reusable launch vehicle - the center of Musk's ambitions to make human space travel more affordable and routine.

A first orbital Starship flight is planned for year's end. Musk has said he intends to fly Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa around the moon with the Starship in 2023.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Marathon bail proceedings for 47 Hong Kong democracy activists charged with conspiracy to commit subversion enter the fourth day on Thursday, in a landmark case after the most sweeping use yet of the city's national security law.
Foreign diplomats and rights groups are closely monitoring the case as concerns mount over the vanishing space for dissent in the former British colony, which has taken a swift authoritarian turn since the imposition of the law in June 2020. 
Hundreds of people were lining up at the court to show their support for the defendants, with the hearing due to start at 10.00 am (0200 GMT).
""The kids wanted to come,"" said Candy, a 40-year-old housewife who started queuing before 5.00 am with her two children. ""This is a declaration of my support.""
The hearings have gone on late into the night for three consecutive days, causing several defendants to fall ill and be sent to the hospital.
A number of the defendants dismissed their legal representatives and plan to add more testimony to their submissions to the court. Hong Kong laws restrict media coverage of the content of bail hearings.
In contrast with the global financial hub's common law traditions, the new security law puts the onus on defendants to prove they will not pose a security threat if released on bail.
The activists, aged 23-64, are accused of organising and participating in an unofficial primary poll last July that authorities said was part of a plan to ""overthrow"" the government.
The vote, in which not all of the accused were winners, was aimed at selecting the strongest opposition candidates for a legislative council election that the government later postponed, citing the coronavirus.
The detentions have been fiercely criticised by governments in the West, including in Britain and the United States. 
Supporters of the security law, which punishes what it broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, say it is necessary to restore stability in Hong Kong after months of pro-democracy protests in 2019.

Among those charged were the organiser of the primary election and former law professor Benny Tai, as well as prominent democracy campaigners Lester Shum, Joshua Wong, Owen Chow, Wu Chi-wai and Sam Cheung.

The incident is the latest in a long-running border conflict between the two South American nations. 
Caracas says much of eastern Guyana is its own territory, a claim rejected by Georgetown. The conflict has flared up in recent years as Guyana has started developing oil reserves near the disputed area.
Guyana's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that two Venezuelan army Sukhoi SU 30 fighter jets had flown over the community of Eteringbang and a nearby airstrip along the countries shared border at a ""very low altitude of 1500 feet"" on Tuesday at about 1:20 p.m. They circled once before flying back into Venezuela, the statement added. 
The incident comes after a Venezuelan navy vessel detained two vessels that were fishing in Guyana's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in January.
EEZs are maritime areas in which countries have special rights with regards to the exploration and use of marine resources.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month issued a decree creating a ""Strategic Zone for the Development of the Atlantic Facade"" in an area that Guyana says encompasses its EEZ and its territorial waters.
""The Government of Guyana condemns this latest act of aggression by the Venezuelan armed forces as a violation of the sovereignty of Guyana over the air above its territory,"" the statement said, adding that the action indicated Venezuela ""is prepared to use aggression and intimidation to accomplish ... the surrender by Guyana of its patrimony.""
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

German government officials said on Tuesday a German frigate would set sail for Asia in August and, on its return journey, become the first German warship to cross the South China Sea since 2002.
""The United States has a national interest in the maintenance of peace and stability, respect for international law, lawful unimpeded commerce, and freedom of navigation and other lawful uses of the sea,"" a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department said.
""We welcome Germany's support for a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific. The international community has a vital stake in the preservation of an open maritime order.""
A spokesman for the foreign ministry in China, which claims most of the South China Sea, said countries enjoyed freedom of navigation and overflight in the waterway under international law, but added: ""they cannot take it as an excuse to undermine the sovereignty and security of littoral countries.""
German officials said the warship would not pass within the 12-nautical-mile limits China and rival states claim as territorial waters around contested features in the strategic waterway.
China has established military outposts on artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea and Washington has rejected Beijing's disputed claims to offshore resources in most of the sea as ""completely unlawful.""
The U.S. Navy regularly conducts ""freedom of navigation"" operations in which its warships pass close by to some of these islands. It has been keen for allies to follow suit.
Last month, France said a French nuclear-propelled attack submarine and warship patrolled in the South China Sea to underscore freedom of navigation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden met with a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House on Wednesday to brainstorm ways to accelerate the fight against cancer, saying he believed the world was nearing some ""real breakthroughs.""
Biden, whose son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46, said the battle against cancer was deeply personal for him - and many Americans.
He told reporters before the meeting that cancer or ""the C word"" remained the most frightening word in the English language. 
""We can make significant strides fighting cancer and Alzheimer's and other diseases,"" he said. ""I think we're on the cusp of some real breakthroughs across the board on cancer.""
The White House said Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had a productive, nearly hour-long discussion with the lawmakers, but gave no details on specific priorities or legislative plans.
Participating in the meeting were three Democratic senators - Patty Murray, Dick Durbin and Chris van Hollen, two Republican senators - Roy Blunt and Mike Crapo, and four lawmakers from the House of Representatives.
Many of the lawmakers helped passed the 21st Century Cures Act during the Obama administration, which authorized billions of dollars in funding for the National Institutes of Health for research on cancer and other diseases.
During the Obama administration, Biden oversaw Cancer Moonshot, an initiative aimed at speeding development of cancer treatments. Over $1 billion has been invested in the initiative to date, supporting over 240 research projects and 70 cancer science initiatives, according to the National Cancer Institute.

Biden also founded the Biden Cancer Initiative in 2017 as a way to bring together researchers and share data, but it suspended operations after Biden announced his White House bid in 2019.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The 13 people killed in a Southern California highway crash were part of a group of nearly four dozen migrants suspected of slipping through a hole cut by human smugglers through a steel fence along the U.S.-Mexico border, federal officials said on Wednesday.
Besides the dead and injured among 25 people crammed into the sport utility vehicle that collided on Tuesday with a tractor-trailer, 19 others were found huddled near a second SUV that caught fire in the same area just north of the border, the officials said.
The 19 were detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, CBP spokesman Macario Mora said. The dozen survivors from the collision were all taken to hospitals for treatment.
Both the Ford Expedition involved in the crash and the Chevrolet Suburban that inexplicably burst into flames appeared to be the same vehicles seen in surveillance footage leaving the vicinity of the fence breach about 30 miles (48 km) to the east, Mora said.
While Border Patrol agents regularly scout the area for illegal crossings, neither vehicle had been under pursuit by U.S. authorities beforehand, according to the agency.
New details of Tuesday's fatal highway wreck near the remote farming community of Holtville, about 10 miles (16 km) north of the border, came to light as the CBP mounted an investigation into the suspected human smuggling operation believed to have led to the tragedy.
""Human smugglers have proven time and again they have little regard for human life,"" the agency said in a statement.
Of the 13 people who died in the collision, at least 10 were Mexican nationals, and Mexicans were also among the injured, according to Mexico's foreign ministry. 
Guatemalan authorities said they had preliminary information that one Guatemalan national died and another was injured in the crash.
Mora said investigators believe that both carloads of migrants crossed into California through a 10-foot-wide gap cut out of the border fence by smugglers in an area known for relatively frequent illegal border crossings.

That section of the fence, consisting of steel bars 18 feet tall, was installed in 2009, some eight years before the Trump administration took office calling for a border wall.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stressed the significance of the role that city and county chief secretaries have in improving the lives of the people and carrying out his five-year economic policies, state news media KCNA said on Thursday.
North Korea's drastic measures to contain COVID-19 have exacerbated human rights abuses and economic hardship, including reports of starvation, for its citizens, already battered by international sanctions, a United Nations investigator said.
Kim said the city and county chief secretaries had responsibility for taking care of their residents and urged them to embark on a fresh ""turning point"" to help develop their areas in line with his new five-year strategy unveiled at the January party congress.
""Now everything depends on the strenuous efforts and role of the chief secretaries,"" Kim said in a statement carried by KCNA.
North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) separately held a plenary meeting on Wednesday where it passed laws including social security and the disinfection of imports, designed to protect people's health, KCNA said.

North Korea has not reported any confirmed coronavirus cases, but has imposed crippling border closings, banned most international travel and severely restricted movement inside the country.

FUKUSHIMA, Japan (Reuters) - A decade ago, Sakae Kato stayed behind to rescue cats abandoned by neighbours who fled the radiation clouds belching from the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant. He won't leave.
""I want to make sure I am here to take care of the last one,"" he said from his home in the contaminated quarantine zone. ""After that I want to die, whether that be a day or hour later."" 
So far he has buried 23 cats in his garden, the most recent graves disturbed by wild boars that roam the depopulated community. He is looking after 41 others in his home and another empty building on his property. 
Kato leaves food for feral cats in a storage shed he heats with a paraffin stove. He has also rescued a dog, Pochi. With no running water, he has to fill bottles from a nearby mountain spring, and drive to public toilets. 
The 57-year-old, a small construction business owner in his former life, says his decision to stay as 160,000 other people evacuated the area was spurred in part by the shock of finding dead pets in abandoned houses he helped demolish.
The cats also gave him a reason to stay on land that has been owned by his family for three generations.
""I don't want to leave, I like living in these mountains,"" he said standing in front of his house, which he is allowed to visit but, technically, not allowed to sleep in. 
The two-storey wooden structure is in poor condition. 
Rotten floorboards sag. It is peppered with holes where wall panels and roof tiles that kept the rain out were dislodged by a powerful earth tremor last month, stirring frightening memories of the devastating quake on March 11, 2001, that led to a tsunami and a nuclear meltdown.
""It might last another two or three years. The walls have started to lean,"" Kato said. 
Decontamination in fields near his house signal that other residents will soon be allowed to return. 
He estimates he spends $7,000 a month on his animals, part of it to buy dog food for wild boar that gather near his house at sunset. Farmers consider them pests, and also blame them for wrecking empty homes. 
On Feb. 25, Kato was arrested on suspicion of freeing wild boar caught in traps set up by Japan's government in November. At time this article was published, he was still being detained for questioning.
FEAR LINGERS
About 30 km (19 miles) southeast, still in the restricted zone, Hisae Unuma is also surveying the state of her home, which withstood the earthquake a decade ago but is now close to collapsing after years of being battered by wind, rain and snow.
""I'm surprised it's still standing,"" the 67-year-old farmer said, a week after the tremor that damaged Kato's house. 
""I could see my cattle in the field from there,"" she said pointing to the living room, a view now blocked by a tangle of bamboo.
Unuma fled as the cooling system at Tokyo Electric Power Co's nuclear plant 2.5 km away failed and its reactors began to melt down. 
The government, which has adopted Fukushima as a symbol of national revival amid preparations for Tokyo Olympic Games, is encouraging residents to return to decontaminated land. 
Lingering fears about the nuclear plant, jobs and poor infrastructure are keeping many away, though.
Unuma, now a vegetable farmer in Saitama prefecture near Tokyo, where her husband died three years ago, won't return even if the government scrapes the radioactive soil off her fields. 
Radiation levels around her house are around 20 times the background level in Tokyo, according to a dosimeter reading carried out by Reuters.
Only the removal of Fukushima's radioactive cores will make her feel safe, a task that will take decades to complete. 
""Never mind the threat from earthquakes, those reactors could blow if someone dropped a tool in the wrong place,"" she said.
Before making the four-hour drive back to her new home, Unuma visits the Ranch of Hope, a cattle farm owned by Masami Yoshizawa, who defied an order to cull his irradiated livestock in protest against the government and Tokyo Electric Power.
Among the 233 bullocks still there is the last surviving bullock from the 50-strong herd Unuma used to tend, and one of her last living links to the life she had before the disaster.
Her bullock ignores her when she tries to lure him over, so Yoshizawa gives her a handful of cabbage to try to tempt him.

""The thing about cattle, is that they really only think about food,"" Yoshizawa said.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh is moving nearly 4,000 more Rohingya Muslim refugees to a remote Bay of Bengal island, officials said on Wednesday, despite complaints from rights groups concerned about the site's vulnerability to storms and flooding.
Dhaka has relocated more than 10,000 people to Bhasan Char island since early December from border camps where more than a million refugees live in ramshackle huts perched on razed hillsides.
""Today 2,254 Rohingya people arrived and tomorrow we are expecting 1,700 plus,"" Navy official Rashed Sattar said from the island.
Bangladesh says the relocation is voluntary, but some refugees from the first group that went there in early December spoke of being coerced.
The government has dismissed safety concerns over the island, citing the building of flood defences as well as housing for 100,000 people, hospitals and cyclone centres.
It also says overcrowding in refugee camps fuels crime, while some Rohingya said frequent violence in the camps had driven them to relocate.
Once they arrive on Bhasan Char, the Rohingya, a minority group who fled violence in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, are not allowed to leave the island, which is several hours' journey from the southern port of Chittagong.
Bangladesh has also drawn criticism for a reluctance to consult with the United Nations refugee agency and other aid bodies over the transfers. 
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says the agency has not been allowed to evaluate the safety and sustainability of life on the island. 
""The process of relocating the Rohingya will continue... they are going there voluntarily for a better life,"" Mohammad Shamsud Douza, the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said by phone from Cox's Bazaar in southeastern Bangladesh.
""Our main priority is repatriating them to their homeland,"" he said.
Bangladesh has called on Myanmar to move forward the stalled process of voluntarily repatriating Rohingya refugees, as international pressure mounts on the military leaders following a coup that reduces the refugees' hopes of returning home.
""How long will we stay here under tarpaulins?,"" said a 39-year-old refugee who moved on Wednesday with his family. ""The little hope we had of returning to our homeland was shattered after the coup.""

Guaido and his allies boycotted legislative elections last December, asserting they would be rigged in favor of candidates aligned with President Nicolas Maduro's party - in part because they alleged the National Electoral Council (CNE), which oversees elections, was made up of Maduro loyalists. 
The socialists won handily, but neither the opposition nor its international allies like the United States and European Union recognize the legitimacy of the new, socialist-held parliament. Guaido named a committee of allied lawmakers he says make up the ""legitimate parliament.""
His comments at a Wednesday press conference came after 70 non-governmental organizations this week presented a list of 15 candidates to conform a new CNE, ahead of elections for state governors and municipal mayors due later this year.
""I celebrate those that put their names forward, but you can understand there is no way (to name a new CNE) through a unilateral process by the dictatorship without the participation of the legitimate parliament, recognized by our allies,"" Guaido said. 
Maduro argues that the conditions of the December 2020 elections were the same as when the opposition won control of the legislature in December 2015, and that opposition parties chose not to participate because they thought they would lose. 
The government's information ministry did not respond to a request for comment. 

Maduro has overseen an economic collapse that has led to a humanitarian crisis since taking office in the once-prosperous OPEC nation in 2013. Washington has imposed sanctions to try to oust Maduro, who it accuses of corruption, rights violations and rigging his 2018 re-election.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pentagon officials took more than three hours to approve a request by the U.S. Capitol Police for National Guard troops to back up police under attack by rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, a military commander told a Senate hearing Wednesday.
Major General William Walker, the District of Columbia's National Guard commander, told senators that an emotional Capitol Police chief Brian Sund, who resigned after the riot, contacted him at 1:49 p.m. on Jan. 6 to request urgent National Guard backup as violent demonstrators began to attack the Capitol building.
Walker told a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Rules committees that the day before the riot, he requested and received Pentagon permission to have on standby a 40-member ""quick reaction force"" and 155 other D.C. guard members.
But Walker said that on Jan. 5, he also received a written order from then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy that he could only deploy the reaction force as a last resort and with a specific operational plan.
Walker said defense officials did not give him final permission to deploy Guard forces until 3 hours and 19 minutes after he received the Capitol Police chief's urgent request.
Officials of the Homeland Security Department and the FBI told senators that months before the Jan. 6 riots, both agencies circulated intelligence reports on domestic extremist groups.
FBI counter-terrorism chief Jill Sanborn said her office issued a warning last August that ""domestic violent extremist responses to the election outcome might not occur until after the election and could be based on potential or anticipated policy changes."" 

But Sanborn acknowledged that a Jan. 5 FBI Norfolk office bulletin warning of possible violence the next day was based on an ""anonymous posting"" on an internet message board.

JANGEBE, Nigeria (Reuters) - One moment, Hadiza was weeping and flinging her arms around her father for the first time since her abduction; the next - gunfire and tear gas filled the air and people ran for cover.
It was supposed to be a joyous reunion to end the five-day ordeal of 279 girls kidnapped last week from the Jangebe Government Girls Science Secondary School in a remote corner of northwest Nigeria.
Cheering children had lined the street as buses brought the girls, grinning and waving, back to their school from the Zamfara state capital Gusau, where they had been cared for since their release on Tuesday. ""Thank you! Thank you!"" yelled one.
Relatives crammed around the buses, and parents laughed with joy as they found their daughters, who shouted ""Thank God!"".
Less than 40 minutes later, pandemonium broke out.
As government officials in a hall were giving lengthy speeches in front of the girls, impatient parents burst in and grabbed their children to take them home.
The officials ran out and shortly afterwards, reporters heard gunshots outside the school gates.
They saw police firing tear gas at a group of protesters outside the school, and soldiers shooting into the air.
At least three people were hit by bullets, but it was not immediately clear by whom.
A Reuters journalist's video showed hundreds of people fleeing down a side street. Two girls grabbed hands, ducked - and then ran as the soldiers fired.
Elsewhere, people threw rocks at government officials' and reporters' cars hurriedly leaving town.
LAWLESSNESS
The chaos drives home the desperation of the situation in northwest Nigeria, where banditry has festered for years, rendering large swathes of the region lawless.
The trend of kidnapping children from boarding schools was started by the jihadist group Boko Haram, which abducted 270 schoolgirls from the northeast in 2014, around 100 of whom have never been found.
It has since been taken up by armed criminal gangs seeking a ransom; the Jangebe abduction was the third mass school kidnapping in northern Nigeria since December. 
Military and police attempts to tackle the gangs have had little success, while many worry that state authorities such as Zamfara's are making the situation worse by letting kidnappers go unpunished, paying them off or, as in Zamfara, giving them amenities.
President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday called for the captors to be brought to justice.
His national security adviser, Babagana Monguno, said the president had ordered a massive military deployment to Zamfara, banned mining and imposed a no-fly zone in the state.

He said the central government ""will not allow this country to drift into state failure"", adding: ""We are not going to be blackmailed.""

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 04:05PM ET</span>",UK royals 'very concerned' about reports saying Meghan bullied staff,"By Michael Holden and Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - Buckingham Palace said it was ""very concerned"" about reports in the Times newspaper on Wednesday that assistants working for Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, had been bullied by her.
The report comes days before the broadcast of an interview that Meghan and her husband Prince Harry have given to U.S. chat show host Oprah Winfrey spelling out why they quit their official roles. Some commentators have suggested they may also criticise their treatment by the royal family.
Harry and Meghan issued a statement denying that she had bullied anyone.
The Times cited unnamed sources as saying an aide to the couple had raised a complaint in October 2018 alleging that Meghan had reduced some of her assistants to tears and treated others so badly that they had quit.
The paper said Harry had urged the aide, who has now left their staff, to drop the complaint, and it never progressed.
The Times said it had been contacted by former staff members who wanted the public to gain insight before the Winfrey interview aired - and that lawyers for the couple had labelled the allegations a smear orchestrated by the Palace.
Reuters could not independently verify the report.
""We are clearly very concerned about allegations in The Times following claims made by former staff of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement.
The Royal Household ""does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment in the workplace"", it added.
It said its HR team would look into the allegations, and that members of staff involved at the time would be invited to participate.
""SADDENED BY ATTACK""
There was no immediate response from Harry and Meghan to the Palace statement.
A spokeswoman had earlier said Meghan was ""saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma"".
It added: ""She is determined to continue her work building compassion around the world and will keep striving to set an example for doing what is right and doing what is good.""
Meghan and Harry, who married in May 2018, stepped back from their official duties in March last year to forge new careers and a financially independent life in California.
That decision was confirmed last month, when they also handed over all their royal patronages. They said their move was fuelled in part by intense press intrusion.
However, Meghan had also previously indicated that she felt she did not have the full support of the royal family. 
In court documents submitted as part of her successful privacy action against the mass-circulation Mail on Sunday, her lawyers said she had felt ""unprotected"" while she was pregnant with their son Archie.
Royal biographer Penny Junor told Reuters the Winfrey interview was likely to be frank.
""I suspect there will be snipes at the royal family. There will probably be a justification for their leaving, which the royal family will probably find uncomfortable,"" she said.

""My biggest fear, I suppose, is that Meghan and Harry say things about their family that they will regret.""

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish police said they were investigating possible terror motives for a knife attack on Wednesday in which at least eight people were injured, and that the assailant has been arrested after being shot and wounded.
Some of the victims were in serious condition and the suspect, a man in his 20s, was hospitalised after his arrest, a police spokeswoman told a news conference. The man was previously known to police for minor crimes, she said. 
""We have started a preliminary investigation of attempted murder but there are details in the investigation that make us investigate possible terror motives,"" regional head of police Malena Grann told a news conference.
Police said the suspect attacked at least five different locations in Vetlanda. 
""We heard a scream from the street. Then we saw a man enter the store, shouting that he had been stabbed,"" Asa Karlqvist, owner of a florist shop, told local newspaper Vetlanda-Posten.
""Blood was pouring from his shoulder, so we got towels and applied pressure on the wound,"" she said.
The situation was under control and there were no indications that anyone else was involved in the attack in the town of Vetlanda, 340 km (210 miles) south of the capital Stockholm.
Prime Minister Stefan Lofven condemned the incident. ""We confront such heinous acts with the combined force of our society,"" he said in a statement, adding he was in constant contact with both the police and the security service. 
Police were alerted to the attack in Vetlanda, a town of around 13,000 people, around 3 p.m. and initially said it did not appear to be an act of terrorism. 

In April 2017, a radical Islamist drove a truck into crowds of shoppers on a busy street in central Stockholm, killing five people before crashing into a department store. He was arrested and later sentenced to life in prison.

(Reuters) - While Texas and Mississippi announced complete rollbacks of their states' COVID-19 mitigation measures this week, several governors of other Republican states have made clear they are not abandoning their mask mandates despite political pressure.
The sharp decline of new daily COVID-19 cases and the rollout of vaccines in the United States have prompted state and local governments to ease business restrictions in recent weeks, with movie theaters set to open at limited capacity in New York and indoor dining resuming in San Francisco on Friday. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WTOZDR)
However, the decline in cases plateaued last week with new infections rising in 29 out of 50 states compared with the prior week. Texas saw a 69% rise in cases in the week ended Feb. 28. 
Few of the rollbacks have been as sweeping as in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott on Tuesday said the state's mask mandate would be lifted and most businesses could open at full capacity next week. 
The move drew immediate criticism from some politicians and public health experts who have urged caution while the nation's vaccination program is still underway.
President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that decisions to end the required wearing of masks - such as those made by Texas and Mississippi - amounted to ""Neanderthal thinking"" given the ongoing deaths being caused by the pandemic.
""I think it's a big mistake. Look, I hope everybody's realized by now, these masks make a difference,"" he told reporters.
Public health experts agree face coverings are essential to slowing the spread of the virus, which has killed more than half a million Americans. But over the last year, resistance to public health measures in the United States, especially mask-wearing, has become politicized, with many Republican states enacting fewer and looser COVID-19 protocols than Democratic states. 
In some Republican-led states, including Florida and South Dakota, there has never been a statewide mask mandate. In others, like Alabama and Ohio, mask mandates remain in effect.
Including the upcoming change in Texas, 34 states mandate that residents wear face masks in public, along with the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 
In Ohio, U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel on Wednesday called on Republican Governor Mike DeWine to follow Texas' lead and repeal the statewide mask order. The governor quickly rejected the idea.
""Ohio will be keeping its mask mandate to protect Ohioans who have yet to receive the vaccine. Vaccine supply is increasing, and there is light at the end of the tunnel, but the virus is still here and the pandemic is still ongoing today,"" a spokesman for DeWine told Reuters in an email.
Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia, a Republican, said on Wednesday he was not ready to ease any restrictions, including an indoor mask mandate. 
""All businesses must continue to follow the safety guidelines,"" Justice said.
Abbott's executive order in Texas will lift all mask requirements statewide as of March 10 and forbid local authorities from penalizing residents who do not wear face coverings. It will remove all restrictions on businesses in counties without a high number of hospitalizations.
Local officials can still apply limits to businesses where hospitalizations remain high, according to the order, but are prohibited from mandating that they operate at less than 50% capacity.
As of Monday, Texas was seeing about 7,500 new cases per day on a seven-day average, according to Reuters data, and it was ranked 47th in the list of states that have vaccinated the highest percentage of their populations. 
Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves, a Republican, on Tuesday also lifted his state's mask order and removed all restrictions on businesses.
But Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat in a majority Republican state, doubled down on his state's mask order even as it increased capacity to 75% at restaurants and retail businesses on Wednesday.

""Louisiana's mask mandate is still in place,"" Edwards tweeted. ""As we vaccinate more and more people, masks are still our most effective tool in stopping the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Myanmar's military says it is ready to withstand sanctions and isolation after its Feb. 1 coup, a top United Nations official said on Wednesday as she urged countries to ""take very strong measures"" to restore democracy in the Southeast Asian nation.
U.N. special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, said 38 people died on Wednesday - the most violent day since the coup - as the military quelled protests. Schraner Burgener is due to brief the U.N. Security Council on Friday.
Myanmar has been in chaos since the army seized power and detained elected government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and much of her National League for Democracy (NLD) leadership. The NLD won an election in November in a landslide, which the military said was fraudulent. The election commission said the vote was fair.
Schraner Burgener said that in conversations with Myanmar's deputy military chief Soe Win, she had warned him that the military was likely to face strong measures from some countries and isolation in retaliation for the coup. 
""The answer was: 'We are used to sanctions, and we survived',"" she told reporters in New York. ""When I also warned they will go in an isolation, the answer was: 'We have to learn to walk with only few friends'.""
Western countries, including the United States, Britain, Canada and the European Union, have implemented or are considering targeted sanctions to squeeze the military and its business allies. 
The 15-member U.N. Security Council has voiced concern over the state of emergency, but stopped short of condemning the coup last month because of opposition by Russia and China, who view the developments as internal affairs of Myanmar. Any action by the council beyond a statement is unlikely, diplomats say.
""I hope that they recognize that it's not only an internal affair, it hits the stability of the region,"" Schraner Burgener said of China and Russia. 
She said Soe Win told her that ""after a year they want to have another election."" Schraner Burgener last spoke with him on Feb. 15 and is now communicating with the military in writing.
""Clearly, in my view, the tactic was now to investigate NLD people to put them in prison,"" she said. ""At the end the NLD will be banned and then they have a new election, where they want to win, and then that they can continue to be in power.""
Schraner Burgener said she believes the military is ""very surprised"" by the protests against the coup. 

""Today we have young people who lived in freedom for 10 years, they have social media, and they are well organized and very determined,"" she said. ""They don't want to go back in a dictatorship and in isolation.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators peppered President Joe Biden's nominee to be the No. 2 official at the State Department with questions about Iran on Wednesday, a sign she could face difficulty winning support from Republicans even as she warned against ""nostalgia"" for the Iran nuclear deal she helped broker.
Wendy Sherman, who helped negotiate the international accord in 2015, promised a new approach to Iran at her Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing.
The 2015 deal, aimed at preventing Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons, was fiercely opposed by Republicans and some Democrats, including Senator Bob Menendez, who is now the committee's chairman. Former Republican President Donald Trump withdrew from the pact in 2018.
Sherman said she did not expect the Democratic Biden administration to duplicate the approach to Iran of former President Barack Obama, for whom Biden was vice president.
Biden's approach must ""be decided on the merits of where we are today, not nostalgia for what might have been,"" she said.
The world had changed since 2016, when the deal was implemented, Sherman said. ""The facts on the ground have changed, the geopolitics of the region have changed, and the way forward must similarly change,"" she said.
Sherman said she did not know what the administration's ultimate Iran policy would be, but stressed that Biden was determined not to let Iran obtain a nuclear weapon.
""Iran is a long way from compliance (with the nuclear agreement), as we well know,"" she said.
Menendez said while he supported the Biden administration's decision to engage with Iran, any policy needed bipartisan support to succeed. 
Senator Jim Risch, the panel's top Republican, also called for bipartisan policy and said he opposed a return to the nuclear pact.
Sherman was State Department counselor from 1997 to 2001, when she was also policy coordinator on North Korea. From 1993 to 1996 she served as assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs.
Several committee Democrats said they looked forward to supporting Sherman's nomination but it was not clear how much support she would receive from Republicans. She can be confirmed without Republican support, since Democrats control the Senate.

The hearing also considered one of Biden's long-time foreign policy advisers, Brian McKeon, to be Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources. McKeon, who was praised by senators from both parties, served as counsel for the committee when then-Senator Biden was its chairman.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The International Criminal Court prosecutor said on Wednesday her office will formally investigate war crimes in the Palestinian Territories, a move welcomed by the Palestinian Authority and denounced by Israel.
The decision follows a ruling by the court on Feb. 5 that it has jurisdiction in the case, prompting swift rejections by Washington and Jerusalem.
""The decision to open an investigation followed a painstaking preliminary examination undertaken by my office that lasted close to five years,"" Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in a statement.
Promising a ""principled, non-partisan, approach"", she said: ""In the end, our central concern must be for the victims of crimes, both Palestinian and Israeli, arising from the long cycle of violence and insecurity that has caused deep suffering and despair on all sides.""
Bensouda, who will be replaced by British prosecutor Karim Khan on June 16, said in December 2019 that war crimes had been or were being committed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. She named both the Israel Defense Forces and armed Palestinian groups such as Hamas as possible perpetrators.
The next step will be to determine whether Israel or Palestinian authorities have investigations themselves and to assess those efforts.
""LONG-AWAITED STEP""
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the court's decision was ""undiluted antisemitism and the height of hypocrisy."" 
He accused the court of turning ""a blind eye"" to Iran, Syria and other countries that he said were committing ""real"" war crimes.
""Without any jurisdiction, it decided that our brave soldiers, who take every precaution to avoid civilian casualties against the worst terrorists in the world who deliberately target civilians, it's our soldiers who are war criminals,"" Netanyahu said in a statement.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said the decision was ""morally bankrupt and legally flawed"".
The Palestinian Authority's foreign ministry welcomed the prosecutor's investigation as ""a long-awaited step that serves Palestine’s tireless pursuit of justice and accountability, which are indispensable pillars of the peace the Palestinian people seek and deserve""
It urged all states to ""refrain from politicizing these independent proceedings."" 
George Giacaman, a Palestinian political analyst and professor at Birzeit University in the occupied West Bank, said the ICC decision showed the Palestinian leadership's strategy of appealing to global institutions had had some success.
While cautioning that the probe could take years, Giacaman said: ""At best, one can say that in the future, the Israelis will be more careful with hitting Palestinian civilians. Perhaps the ICC will prove to be a deterrent.""
The Islamist militant group Hamas, which controls Gaza and is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the United States and European Union, defended its own actions in the conflict.
“We welcome the ICC decision to investigate Israeli occupation war crimes against our people. It is a step forward on the path of achieving justice,” said Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza. 
Rights groups said the decision offered victims hope of justice. Balkees Jarrah, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, said ICC member countries should be ready to protect the court’s work from any political pressure.The ICC is a court of last resort established to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide when a country is unable or unwilling to do so.
The prosecutor's office was targeted by sanctions under former U.S. President Donald Trump in response to its investigation in Afghanistan, which is examining the role of U.S. forces.

The pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, urged President Joe Biden to maintain the sanctions on ICC officials pursuing what it called ""illegitimate, politically motivated investigations into the U.S. and Israel.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators introduced bipartisan legislation on Wednesday to repeal decades-old authorizations for the use of military force used to justify years of attacks in the Middle East, an effort to shift back the authority to declare war to Congress from the White House.
The measure, led by Democratic Senator Tim Kaine and Republican Senator Todd Young, would repeal 1991 and 2002 Authorizations for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Iraq, citing the ""strong partnership"" between Washington and the government in Baghdad.
Under the Constitution, Congress, not the president, has the right to authorize war.
But those AUMFs - and a third one, from 2001, for the fight against al Qaeda - have been used to justify strikes by both Democratic and Republican presidents since they were passed. They have been criticized as allowing ""forever wars"" that have kept U.S. forces fighting overseas for decades. 
The bill's introduction came a week after Democratic President Joe Biden's administration carried out air strikes against facilities belonging to Iranian-backed militia in Syria that renewed questions about whether a president should be able to conduct such actions without congressional approval.
Tensions have been rising with Iran, after strikes in the region blamed on Tehran.
""Last week's airstrikes in Syria show that the Executive Branch, regardless of party, will continue to stretch its war powers,"" Kaine said in a statement.
Members of Congress from both parties have sought repeatedly to repeal the AUMFs in recent years, but efforts have fallen short. 

The other sponsors of the new measure include Democratic Senators Tammy Duckworth, Chris Coons and Dick Durbin, as well as Republican Senators Mike Lee, Chuck Grassley and Rand Paul.

The whereabouts of Navalny, 44, had been a mystery since he left jail in Moscow. 
His lawyer Vadim Kobzev told Reuters he had met Navalny at the Kolchugino jail in the Vladimir region northeast of Moscow. Navalny was was feeling good despite hardship, Kobzev said.
TASS news agency, citing a law enforcement source, said Navalny was being held there for quarantine before his further transportation to the IK-2 penal colony, also in the Vladimir region. The quarantine could last 15 days, it said.
On his twitter feed, Kobzev said Navalny was sharing the cell with two others, but was kept isolated from the outside world with no letters.
""There is nothing in the cell except a TV set. There is no refrigerator or even a tea-kettle.""
Activists have described conditions in the penal colony as particularly severe.
Navalny, who recuperated in Germany from what German authorities say was poisoning with a banned nerve agent, was arrested on his return in January and sentenced for parole violations that he says were trumped up.

His illness and imprisonment have sparked a diplomatic conflict between Russia and the West.

LIMA (Reuters) - Ana Estrada, who is confined to her bed, says she feels ""happy and content"" about a historic decision by Peruvian officials to allow her an assisted death, a remarkable ruling in this mostly Roman Catholic country where euthanasia is illegal.
The Andean country's government decided not to appeal a court ruling that recognizes her right to die.
""It is an individual case, but I hope it serves as a precedent,"" Estrada, 44, told Reuters, after the ministries of justice and health decided late on Tuesday to respect a judge's ruling that she has the right to ""a dignified death.""
""I think it is an achievement not only of mine, not only of my cause, but also an achievement of law and justice in Peru,"" Estrada said with a muffled and broken voice.
Estrada, a psychologist, has suffered for three decades from polymyositis, a rare incurable disease that progressively attacks her muscles. She breathes with a respirator most of the time.
Estrada started a legal battle about five years ago to be allowed to decide to end her own life ""when the time comes.""
Euthanasia is disallowed in many countries and many in Peru strongly oppose the practice. Abortion and same-sex marriage are also prohibited in Peru. In Latin America, Colombia allows the procedure under certain conditions. 
The court ruling last week provides that state health insurer EsSalud provide ""all conditions"" needed for Estrada's euthanasia, which must occur within 10 business days from the date that she decides to end her life.
EsSalud said a statement it would comply with the ruling and form medical commissions to develop a protocol for such cases. The court ruling also cleared anyone assisting Estrada in her death from facing charges, although local law still prohibits anyone from helping people to die.
Estrada has written a blog since 2016 called ""Ana seeks dignified death."" She told Reuters she would decide to end her life when she could no longer write.

""My body is failing, but my mind and my spirit are happy,"" she said. ""I want the last moment of my life to continue like this, in freedom, with peace, tranquility and autonomy. I want to be remembered like that.""

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya expects mass protests against veteran President Alexander Lukashenko to start up again in the spring and to be more organised than last year. 
Speaking to Reuters on a visit to Finland, Tsikhanouskaya said a majority of Belarusians still thought Lukashenko should step down and they had spent the winter getting organised.
""The chair under Lukashenko is shaking,"" she said.
Belarusians took to the streets last year in large numbers after a presidential election in August that the opposition said was rigged. The authorities responded with a crackdown.
The size of the protests dwindled over the winter and Lukashenko, who promised to make unspecified reforms to the constitution, appears to have weathered the storm.
Tsikhanouskaya said the opposition is talking to people in the Belarusian elites, the state administration and riot police and was getting inside information about torture and violence.
""People near him cannot say it out loud but they understand he is not the leader anymore and it is better for them to support the majority of Belarusian people. Lukashenko has put the country into a political, humanitarian and economic crisis,"" she said.
Tsikhanouskaya, who fled to Lithuania the day after the election, said new protest structures were forming, some underground, and that they had already had some impact helping spur strikes or ensuring the ice hockey world championships were taken away from Belarus.
""We never had strikes before,"" Tsikhanouskaya said.
The Belarus opposition is now ""looking for friends everywhere,"" said Tsikhanouskaya, whose team has reached out to China and Japan in addition to western countries.
In Finland on a four-day visit, she met Prime Minister Sanna Marin, President Sauli Niinistö and Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto and suggested that Finland could act as a mediator in the Belarusian crisis. 
Marin and Niinistö declined to comment the request to Reuters but Haavisto, the foreign minister, said he had told Tsikhanouskaya that he thought a third party could not mediate between the Belarusian opposition and the authorities.

Asked if she had tried to talk to Russia, which has played a key role supporting Lukashenko, Tsikhanouskaya said the opposition had sent many messages since the August election but has not received a reply.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The man charged with plowing a rented van into dozens of people in Toronto in 2018, killing 10, is guilty of all 26 counts -- 10 of murder, 16 of attempted murder -- a judge ruled on Wednesday, dismissing the defense argument that the suspect's mental disorder left him with no idea how horrific his actions were.
Alek Minassian, 28, told police he was motivated by a desire to punish society for his perceived status as an ""incel"" - short for involuntary celibate - because he believed women would not have sex with him. Minassian had pleaded not criminally responsible.
But the defense failed to prove Minassian's autism spectrum disorder deprived him of the capacity to know his actions were wrong, Judge Anne Molloy said in a verdict that was live-streamed on YouTube following a trial held virtually due to the pandemic.
Molloy referred to Minassian as ""John Doe"" because of the way the case had given him the notoriety he said he desired.
""Mr. Doe thought about committing these crimes over a considerable period of time and made a considered decision to proceed. His attack on these 26 victims that day was an act of a reasoning mind notwithstanding its horrific nature and notwithstanding that he has no remorse for it, and no empathy for his victims.""
Whether Minassian rented the van or used it to kill people was not at issue in his trial: What was debated was his state of mind at the time. 
Minassian's lawyer argued his autism spectrum disorder prevented him from knowing what he was doing was wrong when he drove the van into pedestrians on a crowded sidewalk.
The attack took place in April 2018 when Minassian drove a rented van down a busy sidewalk on a major street just north of Toronto, hitting one person after another. The victims were as young as 22.
Next, a sentencing hearing will be scheduled where Minassian is likely to automatically get a life sentence, according to criminal lawyers following the case. Minassian's lawyer was not immediately available for comment.
The prosecutor argued Minassian's autism did not deprive him of the ability to assess the morality of his actions.
""He never lost sight of the fact that society viewed his choice as wrong, and he made a choice to go ahead and commit the attack,"" prosecutor Joe Callaghan told the court in December.
""This case has in any ways and on many days been a struggle,"" Molloy said. ""This accused committed a horrific crime – one of the most devastating tragedies this city has ever endured – for the purpose of achieving fame.""
Molloy read out the names of the people Minassian killed and injured, listing their injuries: from fractured bones to bleeding brains.
Minassian ""was capable of understanding the impact (his crime) would have on his victims. He knew death would be irreversible. He knew their families would grieve,"" she said.

“He had a functioning, rational brain, one that perceived the reality of what he was doing.... He chose to commit the crimes anyway. Because it was what he really wanted to do.""

The coalition has frequently disagreed over how to tackle the pandemic, and Matovic made his decision despite demands from his party's partners not to use the Russian vaccine until it is registered by the European Union's medicines watchdog EMA.
Slovakia is the second EU country after Hungary to buy Sputnik V vaccine, whose maker has not filed for registration with EMA but has been offering it to individual EU members.
A junior partner in Slovakia's coalition, Za Ludi (For the People), threatened to quit the government over the matter while another, Freedom and Solidarity (SaS), called for a reshuffle of the cabinet formed after an election a year ago.
A military plane was sent to Moscow at the weekend to bring back 200,000 shots of Sputnik V, the first batch of what Matovic said would be 2 million in total. He also went to the eastern city of Kosice for the arrival of the shipment, angering his coalition partners.
""I am against an early election...but reconstruction of the cabinet is a solution that may calm the situation down,"" SaS leader Richard Sulik said live on television after he and Za Ludi leader Veronika Remisova met President Zuzana Caputova on Wednesday.
Sulik noted that government reshuffles in the past had included a change of prime minister.
Za Ludi's leaders debated leaving the cabinet but had not come to any decision, Slovak media reported. Standing beside Sulik, Remisova said reshuffling the cabinet was an option.
Matovic defended his decision on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
""The Russians are not doing anything, and our (coalition) partners deployed Sputnik V as the heaviest weapon to break up their own government,"" he said.
Foreign Minister Ivan Korcok, nominated by SaS, said on Tuesday the purchase put in question the EU and NATO country's position on the international scene.
""Sputnik V is not just a vaccine - it is a tool in a hybrid war,"" he said.

Slovakia's hospitals have recently been stretched by record numbers of coronavirus patients, around 4,000. The country of 5.5 million has reported 7,489 coronavirus deaths.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday singled out the U.S. relationship with China as the main overseas focus of President Joe Biden's administration and said the country posed ""the biggest geopolitical test"" of this century.
In a speech at the State Department, Blinken sought to set out how foreign policy will bring benefits for American workers and families, and said that was key to the new administration's approach.
Biden wants to signal a break with former President Donald Trump's ""America First"" approach by re-engaging with allies and centering multilateral diplomacy, while also recognizing the world has changed since he served in the Obama administration that preceded Trump.
""We will fight for every American job and for the rights, protections and interests of all American workers,"" Blinken said.
China was the only nation Blinken said was one of eight priorities, which also included working to avoid another global pandemic, tackling climate change and promoting democracy abroad.
China is the only country with the power to seriously challenge the U.S. ability to shape the global system of ""rules, values and relationships,"" he said.
""Our relationship with China will be competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be, and adversarial when it must be,"" Blinken said.
The world's two most powerful nations are at odds over influence in the Indo-Pacific region, Beijing’s economic practices, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights in China's Xinjiang region.
Biden has called Beijing the ""most serious competitor"" for the United States and his administration has indicated it will broadly continue a tough approach to China taken by Trump.
Engaging with China ""from a position of strength,"" as the administration seeks to do, ""requires standing up for our values when human rights are abused in Xinjiang or when democracy is trampled in Hong Kong, because if we don’t, China will act with even greater impunity,"" Blinken said.
Blinken has said he agrees with his predecessor Mike Pompeo's determination that genocide against Muslims is underway in Xinjiang, but did not use the term in his speech.

Activists and U.N. experts say 1 million Muslim Uighurs are held in Chinese camps. China denies abuses and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.

1230,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 11:11AM ET</span>",Indigenous people sue retailer Casino over Amazon destruction,"PARIS (Reuters) - Indigenous peoples from Brazil and Colombia sued retailer Casino in a French court on Wednesday over the selling of beef linked to land grabbing and deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), campaigners involved in the lawsuit said. 
It is the first time a French supermarket chain has been taken to court over deforestation and the loss of land and livelihood under a 2017 law in France that demands its companies avoid human rights and environmental violations in their supply chains.
Casino declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Casino controls Brazil's largest food retailer, Grupo Pao de Acucar (GPA), which itself owns Colombian retailer Almacenes Exito. Brazil is Casino's second largest market after France.
The lawsuit alleges that Casino regularly bought beef from three slaughterhouses owned by a major Brazilian meatpacker. 
Those slaughterhouses sourced cattle from nearly 600 suppliers responsible for at least 50,000 hectares -- an area five times the size of Paris -- of deforestation between 2008 and 2020, according to the lawsuit. 
The Amazon plays a vital role in regulating the Earth’s climate by absorbing carbon dioxide, one of the main greenhouse gases responsible for global warming.
An area of the Amazon rainforest the size of Israel was felled last year, campaign groups say. Cattle ranching is a big driver of habitat loss, as population growth and the expanding middle classes of developing nations fuel the consumption of meat and dairy.
In Colombia, cattle ranching and mining were threatening the future of indigenous communities, said Fany Kuiru Castro of the Ultoto people.
Companies are under growing pressure from national legislation and campaigners to protect the Amazon.
French bank BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) in February pledged to only finance companies producing beef or soybeans in Latin America that adopt a strategy of zero deforestation by 2025.
In January, BNP Paribas,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Dutch lender ING announced they were to stop financing the trade in crude oil from Ecuador. Indigenous leaders said the banks’ money made them complicit in the destruction of rainforest by Ecuador’s oil industry. 

Plaintiffs to the lawsuit include French and U.S. campaign groups.

A week ago, Hungary became the first European Union member to start inoculating people with China's Sinopharm vaccine after rolling out Russia's Sputnik V vaccine as well, even though neither has been granted approval for emergency use by the bloc.
In order to ensure as many people as possible get at least a first dose of a vaccine fast, the Hungarian government has already extended the gap between the first and second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. It also has widened the gap between the AstraZeneca doses to 12 weeks.
""A new change is that it (AstraZeneca jab) can be given to everyone above the age of 18 without any age limit. There has been sufficient data that proves its efficacy also for older people,"" Muller said in a briefing.
It was not clear when Hungary would implement the change. Its AstraZeneca vaccination program scheduled for this coming weekend is still only for people aged 18 to 60 who have chronic diseases.
Hungary plans to administer more than half a million jabs over the next week with the five available vaccines, as it tries to boost vaccinations to contain a third wave of the pandemic partly fueled by the British variant of the virus.
As of Wednesday, just over 758,000 people in Hungary had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. 
Germany's health minister said earlier on Wednesday that he had asked that country's vaccine regulator to adjust its recommendation so that the AstraZeneca vaccine could be rolled out quickly to those over 65 in Germany.

British scientists urged European countries to take note on Wednesday of interim data showing what they described as the ""remarkable"" effectiveness of a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines in frail and elderly people.

RABAT (Reuters) - Jihadist groups in the nearby Sahel region, which recruit and train their followers online, represent Morocco's biggest militant threat, the head of its counterterrorism agency said. 
Although Morocco has had only one major attack over the past decade - the 2018 killing of two Scandinavian tourists - its location ""makes it a target for the Sahel groups"" said Haboub Cherkaoui. 
""The terrorist threat persists as long as there are groups that recruit and train their followers online including Islamic State in the greater Sahara,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
Since it was set up in 2015, Cherkaoui's Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation has dismantled dozens of militant cells and arrested more than a thousand suspected jihadists, he said. 
The numbers point to the continued militant risk in Morocco after the rise of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq last decade caused a surge in jihadist activity that persists even after the group was defeated in its Middle East heartland. 
Islamic State refocused on the Sahel region, he said, and along with other jihadist groups there has taken advantage of porous borders and trafficking networks. 
Both Niger and Mali have battled militant insurgencies while Libya's civil war has created space for jihadist groups to operate. 
In late February, Moroccan Prime Minister Saad Dine El Otmani took part in a Sahel security summit in Ndjamena and offered support for military action against jihadist groups, including through training troops.
Morocco is also concerned that some of its nationals who joined Islamic State in the Middle East might have relocated to the Sahel, Cherkaoui said.
In total, 1,645 Moroccans joined jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq, including 745 who died in suicide attacks or in battle. Most of the 1,645 fought for Islamic State. 
Of the survivors, 270 have returned to Morocco and 137 were prosecuted, said Cherkaoui, adding that 288 women and 391 minors also went to the conflict zones, following their main income provider.
Moroccan law punishes by up to 10 years those who join jihadist groups abroad. 
Morocco has offered intelligence that helped arrest Jihadists or foil attacks in France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Germany, Burkina Faso, Sri Lanka and recently the United States, Cherkaoui said. 

""Our success hinges on continued intelligence sharing with our partners,"" Cherkaoui said.

OLSZTYN, Poland (Reuters) - COVID ward doctor Lukasz Grabarczyk fears his city of Olsztyn in Poland's north-eastern lake district is starting to experience its worst period of the pandemic, as it becomes the epicentre of the country's third wave.
Epidemiologists and doctors are trying to find out why the sparsely-populated region, which up until now had low infection rates, has seen such a sharp spike, especially of the variant first detected in Britain, and believe Poles returning from there may be behind it.
On Wednesday, the region of 1.4 million saw 1,132 new daily coronavirus cases. Its infection rates per 100,000 people are consistently more than double the national average, according to recent data. 
""There's an avalanche of new patients and we are running out of beds,"" said Grabarczyk. 
Professor Andrzej Horban, the Polish prime minister's top COVID advisor, recently told private broadcaster Polsat : ""This could be the effect of visits by Poles during the Christmas break. We know that in Britain... this variant was first discovered around late September and the peak of infection was in December, so it took about three months to dominate the population."" 
Last week, Poland's government increased restrictions on the region, closing shopping centres, hotels, cinemas and museums and sending children in the first three years of primary school back to remote learning after having lifted restrictions only two weeks earlier.
Jacek Kosmala, the mayor of the town of Nidzica, also believes the spike is due to locals working in Britain and Germany and then returning home with the virus. 
The lake district is one of the poorest parts of Poland and many locals left to seek work abroad.
Poland's government faced domestic criticism for allowing flights in from Britain on Dec. 21 as infection rates were soaring there and as other countries halted all flights.
Passengers that arrived at the local Olsztyn-Mazury airport did not require tests to fly to Poland nor did they get tested upon landing, an airport representative said. No flights have gone to or from Britain since mid-January from the airport and there were no incoming flights after Christmas, she added. 
Krzysztof Saczka, Poland's deputy head of the Sanitary Inspectorate, said he didn't believe the spike was tied to travel but was rather due to the natural spread of the virus and also citizens not following restrictions. 
Patients in Grabarczyk's ward said too many people in the lake district flouted restrictions, and were not wearing masks or not wearing them properly.
Teresa Drozdowska, a 57 year-old COVID patient at the ward and a teacher who usually lives in Cologne, Germany, got sick in Poland after coming to visit her family. She fears the worst of the pandemic could still be ahead as the weather gets warmer.

""We know that more people will come in the spring. This is the kind of terrain that everyone wants to come to for fun. Vacations, meetings...this is what I'm afraid of. I'm afraid of what will come.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Senior U.S. officials have held a first direct meeting with officials from the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that controls Yemen's capital, two sources familiar with the matter said, as the new U.S. administration pushes to end a six-year war.
The discussions, which have not been officially made public by either side, took place in the Omani capital Muscat on Feb. 26 between U.S. Yemen envoy Timothy Lenderking and the Houthis' chief negotiator Mohammed Abdusalam, the sources said.
The Houthis captured Yemen's capital in 2014 and control most populated areas. A Saudi-led coalition has battled them with tacit Western support since 2015 in a war that has killed tens of thousands and created what the United Nations considers the world's biggest humanitarian crisis.
The Saudis and Houthis have been negotiating for more than a year towards a truce, directly and under the auspices of the United Nations.
The Muscat meeting, one of the sources said, was part of a new ""carrot and stick"" approach by U.S. President Joe Biden, who last month declared a halt to U.S. support for the Saudi-led military campaign. Biden has also reversed a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump to designate the Houthis terrorists.
The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday imposed new sanctions on two Houthi military leaders, accusing them of procuring weapons from Iran and organising attacks, after the group stepped up attacks on Saudi Arabia and intensified an offensive on the ground in Yemen's Marib.
Lenderking met Abdusalam in Muscat after meeting with Saudi and U.N. officials in Riyadh. He also visited the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar during his regional tour. The UAE in particular has played a major role in the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen.
The sources said Lenderking had pressed the Houthis to halt the Marib offensive and encouraged the movement to engage actively with Riyadh in virtual talks on a ceasefire.
Abdulsalam, who is also the spokesman of the Houthi movement, did not respond to a Reuters' requests for comment.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson said Lenderking has been meeting with regional senior government officials and has met with U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths during his trip.  
""We will not be commenting on all his engagements,"" the spokesperson told Reuters.   
CEASEFIRE TALKS 
In ceasefire talks, Saudi Arabia has been seeking assurances on border security and curbing the influence of regional arch-rival Iran. The Saudi level of representation at virtual talks was recently raised, with Riyadh's ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed al-Jaber, now speaking with Abdulsalam, the sources said.
Jaber did not respond to a request for comment.
Riyadh wants a buffer zone inside Yemen along the border. The Houthis want an end to blockades on the Red Sea port of Hodeidah and Sanaa airport.
If agreement is reached, one of the sources said, it would be taken to U.N. envoy Griffiths to prepare for broader peace talks that would include Yemen's internationally recognised, Saudi-backed government, now based in the port of Aden.
The war, stalemated for years, has shifted to the gas-producing region of Marib where hundreds of fighters have been killed in a Houthi offensive, the most deadly clashes since 2018.

On Wednesday, heavy clashes were reported around Marib and in Taiz, another heavily disputed city.

free three young Shi'ite Muslims whose death sentences for taking part in protests as minors have been commuted, citing allegations of torture and unfair trials.
The kingdom's human rights record has come under growing U.N. and Western scrutiny. The United States last week imposed sanctions on some Saudis for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, but spared crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Saudi Arabia's state-backed Human Rights Commission said on Feb. 7 that three young Shi'ite Muslims sentenced to death when they were minors had had the penalty reduced to 10 years in prison.
Ali Al-Nimr, the nephew of prominent Shi'ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr whose 2016 execution sparked demonstrations in Saudi Arabia and Iran, was 17 when he was detained in Feb. 2012 for taking part in protests in the country's Eastern Province. He was part of a trio of juvenile offenders who faced beheading.
“We reiterate our call to the authorities to release Mr. Ali al-Nimr, Mr. Dawood al-Marhoon and Mr. Abdullah al-Zaher or, at the very least, to retry them in accordance with international law and standards, without delay,"" the U.N. rights experts said in a statement calling for charges to be dropped.
The experts, who include Agnes Callamard, the U.N. investigator on summary killings, added: ""We continue to receive allegations of torture and ill-treatment to extract confessions, and in relation to the imposition of the death penalty for crimes which do not meet the threshold of ‘most serious crimes’, required under international law."" 
They urged Saudi authorities to confirm a moratorium on executions for drug offences, announced in January ""but not yet codified"".

1236,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 08:51AM ET</span>",Myanmar security forces shoot dead 13 anti-coup protesters despite calls for restraint,"(Reuters) - Myanmar security forces opened fire on protests against military rule on Wednesday, killing at least 13 people, witnesses and media reported, a day after neighbouring countries called for restraint and offered to help Myanmar resolve the crisis.
The security forces resorted to live fire with little warning in several towns and cities, witnesses said, as the junta appeared more determined than ever to stamp out protests against the Feb. 1 coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.
""It's horrific, it's a massacre. No words can describe the situation and our feelings,"" youth activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi told Reuters via a messaging app.
A spokesman for the ruling military council did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.
The heaviest toll was in the central town of Monywa, where five people - four men and one woman - were killed, said Ko Thit Sar, editor of the Monywa Gazette.
""We've confirmed with family members and doctors, five people have been killed,"" he told Reuters.
""At least 30 people are wounded, some still unconscious.""
In the main city Yangon, witnesses said at least three people were killed when security forces opened fire with automatic weapons in the early evening.
""I heard so much continuous firing. I lay down on the ground, they shoot a lot and I saw two people killed on the spot,"" protester Kaung Pyae Sone Tun, 23, told Reuters. He said several people were wounded and carried away.
Two people were killed in the country's second-biggest city Mandalay, a witness and media reports said. Two people were killed in the northern mining town of Hpakant, a resident there said, and one person was killed in the central town of Myingyan.
At least 35 people have been killed since the coup.
The violence came a day after foreign ministers from Southeast Asian neighbours urged restraint but failed to unite behind a call for the release Suu Kyi and the restoration of democracy.
""The country is like the Tiananmen Square in most of its major cities,"" the Archbishop of Yangon, Cardinal Charles Maung Bo, said on Twitter, referring to the violent suppression of student-led protests in Beijing in 1989.
Security forces breaking up protests in Yangon detained about 300 protesters, the Myanmar Now news agency reported. 
Video posted on social media showed lines of young men, hands on heads, filing into army trucks as police and soldiers stood guard. Reuters was unable to verify the footage.
'CONTINUE THIS FIGHT'
Images of a 19-year-old woman, one of the two shot dead in Mandalay, showed her wearing a T-shirt that read ""Everything will be OK"".
Police in Yangon ordered three medics out of an ambulance, shot up the windscreen and then kicked and beat the workers with gun butts and batons, video broadcast by U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia showed. Reuters was unable to verify the video independently.
Democracy activist Esther Ze Naw told Reuters that the sacrifices of those who died would not be in vain.
""We will continue this fight and win. We shall overcome this and win,"" she said.
On Tuesday, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) failed to make a breakthrough in a virtual foreign ministers' meeting on Myanmar.
While united in a call for restraint, only four members - Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore - called for the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees.
""We expressed ASEAN's readiness to assist Myanmar in a positive, peaceful and constructive manner,"" the ASEAN chair, Brunei, said in a statement.
Myanmar's state media said the military-appointed foreign minister, Wunna Maung Lwin, attended the conference and ""apprised the meeting of voting irregularities"" in a November election.
The military justified the coup saying its complaints of voter fraud in the Nov. 8 vote were ignored. Suu Kyi's party won by a landslide, earning a second term. 
The election commission said the vote was fair.
Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing has pledged to hold new elections but given no time frame.
Foreign firms should suspend all business in Myanmar to send a clear message to the military, Chris Sidoti, a former U.N. expert on the country said.
Suu Kyi, 75, has been held incommunicado since the coup but appeared at a court hearing via video conferencing this week and looked in good health, a lawyer said.
She is one of nearly 1,300 people who have been detained, according to activists.

Ousted President Win Myint is facing two new charges, his lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, said, including one for a breach of the constitution that is punishable by up to three years in prison.

    After the crew had been taken to safety on Tuesday, the navy was sent to the site of the capsized vessel to check for an oil spill, but discovered a few crew members had been forgotten.
""I used my camera to zoom in to the boat, and I saw one or two cats popping their heads out,"" said First-Class Petty Officer Wichit Pukdeelon of the navy's air and coastal defence division.
A sailor in a life vest swam out to the capsized boat, on which four ginger cats were huddled together on a wooden beam.
The rescuer brought the cats to his boat on his shoulder above the water level, with his team pulling him in by rope. 
    His posts on the rescue received more than 2,500 comments on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Wednesday praising the crew. 

The cats are now being cared for by their rescuers at their command post on the island of Koh Lipe.

1239,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 08:30AM ET</span>",Turkish court probes pro-Kurdish party as pressure for ban grows: officials,"By Orhan Coskun and Daren Butler
ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's top appeals court has launched an enquiry into the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) over alleged links to militants in a step that could ultimately lead to a ban on the third biggest party in parliament, officials said on Wednesday.
The move coincided with President Tayyip Erdogan's pledge on Tuesday to strengthen freedom of expression and rights to a fair trial in an ""action plan"" that critics said did not address concern about an erosion of human rights in Turkey.
The HDP has faced growing pressure after Ankara said last month Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants executed 13 prisoners, including Turkish military and police personnel, during an army operation to rescue them in Iraq's Gara region.
A senior member of Erdogan's ruling AK Party on Tuesday endorsed nationalist calls for the closure of the HDP, which has 56 members in the 660-seat assembly. It is accused of links to the banned PKK, which it denies.
""The judiciary has begun an enquiry,"" an AKP official told Reuters. ""The appeals court has sprung into action. The possibility of it being closed appears pretty high."" 
Turkey has a long history of banning parties although they have often been able to re-form under new names. The official said measures may be taken to prevent this happening again.
A crackdown on the HDP in recent years has included the arrests of thousands of party officials and members, while dozens of its elected mayors and lawmakers have been ousted. It was defiant over the latest pressure.
""The efforts to shut us down will diminish them further and make us grow more,"" HDP co-leader Mithat Sancar told his party's lawmakers on Tuesday, recalling the banning of a previous pro-Kurdish party in 1994.
""After they closed the party the same political tradition grew in waves,"" he said. ""They will see very clearly that we will emerge stronger from this tyrannical darkness."" 
Many HDP deputies already face bids to lift their immunity from prosecution. The party's jailed former leader is among those charged over deadly 2014 protests in Turkey calling for action to protect Kurds in Syria from Islamic State.
Another official said the appeals court had sought from prosecutors copies of the indictment over the 2014 protests and details of cases against HDP deputies, and will examine whether the party is a focus for PKK activities.
A nationalist party allied to Erdogan's government repeated on Tuesday its call for the HDP's closure over links to the PKK, which Turkey, the European Union and United States designate a terrorist group.

More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict since the PKK launched its insurgency in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey in 1984.

(Reuters) - Denis Giles, the editor of a small Indian newspaper, received a phone call as he sat typing in his one-room office in Port Blair overlooking the languid waters of the Andaman Sea.
The caller, Mohammed Siddiqui, was frantic and largely incoherent. Giles said he was about to hang up until he heard, in broken Hindi: ""Please help me... Many people may die."" 
Siddiqui pleaded with Giles to spread the word of dozens of Rohingya Muslims fleeing Bangladesh for Malaysia aboard a crippled fishing boat in the Andaman Sea. Eight of the passengers had already died.
""You can help me save lives,"" Siddiqui told Giles, who publishes the English-language Andaman Chronicle, which has been covering news in India's coral reef-fringed Andaman and Nicobar archipelago for more than 15 years.
Siddiqui's brother and the other Rohingya passengers had paid human traffickers to smuggle them to Malaysia from cramped refugee camps in southern Bangladesh that are home to more than a million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar.
Siddiqui, who lives in Australia, told Reuters that he learned of the fate of the vessel after his brother made an SOS call from a satellite phone on board the boat on Feb. 18, roughly a week after it embarked on the voyage from Cox's Bazar in southeastern Bangladesh.
""No one knew of the boat until the engine developed a snag and it drifted near Indian waters,"" Siddiqui said. ""That was when I got to know that my brother was stuck on a boat with 80 survivors and that eight were dead due to extreme dehydration or hunger."" 
Siddiqui said he tried to reach the Bangladesh Coast Guard and other agencies. 
""There was just no response. Finally I decided to call some journalists and based on the GPS coordinates I realised the only person who could help was someone based in the Andaman Islands,"" Siddiqui said.
FAVOURED DESTINATION
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya were forced to flee their homeland after a crackdown by Myanmar's military in 2017. Myanmar denies accusations of genocide and says the army was fighting a legitimate counter-insurgency campaign.
The Rohingya are a minority group, most of whom are denied citizenship by Buddhist-majority Myanmar, which considers them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.
Muslim-majority Malaysia has been a favoured destination for fleeing Rohingya. Many risk the perilous sea journey in rickety boats despite Malaysia saying last year it would no longer accept them. 
Siddiqui, who was given the coordinates by the fishing boat captain, passed them to Giles, who was the first person to call the Indian Coast Guard to alert them. That was Feb. 19. 
""I told them people are dying they must send ships to help them but Indian officials instead suggested I send them details via email,"" said Giles.
He fired off an email with the coordinates of the boat that was adrift roughly 235 km (150 miles) northeast of Port Blair, said Giles in an effort to explain the urgency.
Giles, who published a story about the refugees on Feb. 21, said he only received a call from the coast guard on Feb. 23 to inform him that a rescue was under way. 
The Indian Coast Guard and Navy did not respond to requests for comment on the rescue operation. Trapped at sea https://graphics.reuters.com/BANGLADESH-ROHINGYA/RECONSTRUCT/yxmvjxdedvr/chart.png 
""THE SEA IS NOT THEIR HOME"" 
But while the boat has been located, the fate of the passengers remains far from certain.
India's foreign ministry confirmed the boat had been found and that two Coast Guard ships were helping those on board and repairing the vessel so that it could return safely to Bangladesh.
But Bangladesh Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen last week told Reuters his government expects either India, the closest country, or Myanmar to take it in.
Aid agencies are demanding that governments stop passing the buck and act.
""The law of the sea equally binds all states to come to the rescue of persons in distress at sea and deliver them to a place of safety,"" said Catherine Stubberfield, an Asia-Pacific spokeswoman for the UNHCR.
""This applies regardless of nationality, legal status, or circumstances in which people in distress are found.""
New Delhi has not signed the 1951 Refugee Convention, which spells out refugee rights and state responsibilities to protect them, nor does it have a law protecting refugees.
Giles said he feels relieved the refugees are at least getting help for now, along with food, water and medicine. 

""I hope the Rohingya receive a warm welcome from a country at the earliest,"" said Giles. ""The sea is not their home.""

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 08:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. House Democrats urge Biden to revert to Obama-era Cuba detente,"By Sarah Marsh
(Reuters) - Eighty U.S. House of Representatives Democrats urged President Joe Biden on Tuesday to repeal Donald Trump's ""cruel"" sanctions on Cuba and renew engagement, an early sign of support in Congress for easing the clamp-down on the Communist-run country.
    In a letter to Biden seen by Reuters they urged the Democratic president to sign an executive order ""without delay"" to end restrictions on travel and remittances, noting that well over half of Cubans depend on the latter.
""With the stroke of a pen, you can assist struggling Cuban families and promote a more constructive approach,"" they said.
    The letter was led by lawmakers Bobby Rush, Gwen Moore, Barbara Lee and Steve Cohen, long-time supporters of engagement with Cuba. Signers also included the leaders of the influential House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Financial Services and Appropriations committees.
    Biden, a Democrat, vowed during his campaign to reverse policy shifts by the Republican Trump that ""have inflicted harm on the Cuban people and done nothing to advance democracy and human rights.""
Trump's tightening of the decades-old U.S. trade embargo on Cuba has inflicted further pain on its ailing state-run economy, contributing to worsening shortages of food and medicine.
    But Biden has not yet indicated whether he will fully revert to the historic detente initiated by Democratic former President Barack Obama when Biden was vice president.
""This letter, signed by a number of key powerbrokers in the House of Representatives, will help empower U.S. foreign policy officials in the Biden administration who seek to rebuild what Trump destroyed - a constructive, productive and civil approach toward Cuba and its people,"" said Peter Kornbluh, co-author of ""Back Channel to Cuba"" and senior analyst at the National Security Archive. 
    The Trump administration took more than 200 initiatives to tighten the decades-old U.S. trade embargo on Cuba over four years, citing concerns about a lack of democracy and Havana's support for Venezuela's socialist government.
Critics said Trump's approach did not address such concerns and was more likely aimed at winning over voters in the swing state of Florida, which has a large Cuban-American population and did back Trump in the Nov. 3 election.
    The letter also urged Biden to restart diplomatic engagement on areas of mutual interest like health and security and restaff the U.S. embassy, which was reduced to skeletal staffing under Trump over still unexplained health incidents among U.S. diplomats in Havana.
    It should also ""reverse the recent politicized decision by the departing Trump Administration to add Cuba back to the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism,"" the letter states.
On Jan. 11, nine days before the end of his presidency, Trump added Cuba to the list, which among other things carries a prohibition on U.S. economic aid and a requirement that Washington oppose loans to Cuba by institutions such as the World Bank.
A White House official dampened hopes for a quick Cuba policy shift in an interview with Reuters at the weekend, saying it was not currently among Biden's top priorities, which include the coronavirus pandemic, economic recovery and rebuilding alliances abroad.
Asked about the prospects for loosening up remittances and easing restrictions on family trips, the White House official said: ""The best ambassadors are the American people, specifically the Cuban-American people maybe coming in with remittances and travel.""

But the official declined to provide a timetable for such changes, saying: ""Because, frankly, first things first.""

1242,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 07:56AM ET</span>",Swiss to vote on banning face veils in referendum criticized as Islamophobic,"By John Revill
ZURICH (Reuters) - ""Stop Extremism!"" urges a red billboard in a quiet village outside Zurich above an image of a scowling woman wearing a black headscarf and face veil.
The billboard is part of a campaign by the far-right Swiss People's Party (SVP) to ban face coverings in public and which will be voted on in a binding national referendum on Sunday. Opinion polls suggest most Swiss will back it and the ban will become law.
""In Switzerland our tradition is that you show your face. That is a sign of our basic freedoms,"" said Walter Wobmann, an SVP member of parliament and chairman of the referendum committee.
The proposal predates the COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen all adults forced to don masks in many settings to prevent the spread of infection. It gathered the necessary support to trigger a referendum in 2017. 
It does not mention Islam directly, and also aims to stop violent street protesters and football hooligans wearing masks. Still, local politicians, media and campaigners have dubbed it the burqa ban.
The proposal compounds Switzerland's tense relationship with Islam after citizens voted to ban building any new minarets in 2009. Two cantons already have local bans on face coverings. 
Wobmann said the vote was not against Islam itself, but added, ""the facial covering is a symbol for this extreme, political Islam which has become increasingly prominent in Europe and which has no place in Switzerland."" 
France banned wearing a full face veil in public in 2011 and Denmark, Austria the Netherlands and Bulgaria have full or partial bans on wearing face coverings in public. 
No one in Switzerland wears a burqa and only around 30 women wear the niqab, the University of Lucerne estimates. Muslims make up 5.2% of the Swiss population of 8.6 million people, with most having their roots in Turkey, Bosnia and Kosovo. 
Swiss Muslims have said right-wing parties were using the vote to rally their supporters and demonise them and others have warned a ban could stoke wider divisions.
""The niqab is a blank sheet which allows people to project their fears onto it,"" said Andreas Tunger-Zanetti, manager of Lucerne University's Centre for Research on Religion.
""But ... you are very unlikely to meet someone on a Swiss street wearing one.""
He said a ban risked cementing Switzerland's image as anti-Islamic and could create resentment amongst some Muslims.
Rifa'at Lenzin, 67, a Swiss Muslim woman, said she was totally against the ban, which was tackling a problem which didn't exist, in a country where Muslims were well integrated.
""Changing the constitution to tell people what they can and cannot wear is a very bad idea.. This is Switzerland, not Saudi Arabia.""

""We are Muslims but we are Swiss citizens who have grown up here too,"" Lenzin said. ""This vote is simply racist and Islamophobic.""

1243,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 07:35AM ET</span>",Cyprus to lift veil of secrecy with register of company owners,"By Michele Kambas
NICOSIA (Reuters) - Cyprus plans to launch a register in coming months identifying the owners of thousands of companies on the island, lifting a veil of secrecy on opaque and complex corporate structures that campaigners say can help criminals seeking to hide their loot.
Details of thousands of companies domiciled on the island, many thought to have Russian links, will be collected from March 16 to be entered in a so-called Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) register.
Supporters say the register, a requirement of European Union anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, could be a game changer for Cyprus, which activists say has in the past been a magnet for those concealing wealth behind brass plate companies, lured by competitive tax rates.
""We will give companies six months to collect all the details to enter into the system,"" said Antonia Faita-Stavride, a senior administrative officer at Cyprus's Ministry of Energy, Commerce and Industry, who is coordinating the project.
Experts predict some companies will shift jurisdiction rather than reveal their beneficial owners.
TARNISHED IMAGE
Cyprus has long attempted to shake off an image of a jurisdiction that blindly takes investors' cash, no questions asked. A lucrative passport-for-investment scheme was abruptly pulled last year after reports of possible corruption.
Campaigners say finding the ultimate owner of Cyprus-registered firms at present can be like searching for a needle in a haystack - a paper trail that begins with a labyrinth of local ""directors"" and then loops around other low-tax jurisdictions before hitting a dead end.
Such shell companies are ""one of the most used vehicles to launder money"", said Maira Martini, research and policy expert on corrupt money flows at Transparency International.
Katerina Antoniou, Director of Compliance, Risk and Anti-Money Laundering at Deloitte, said a number of companies registered in Cyprus had already switched domicile after stricter controls imposed by banks in 2020. 
""The registers may trigger another wave of re-domiciliation, especially for those entities that would like to avoid the declaration of the UBOs,"" said Antoniou.
It was, she said, ""a very important tool"" in the hands of authorities.
MORE NEEDED?
Faita-Stavride, the energy, commerce and industry ministry official, said the initial register would be an interim database, which government agencies could access on request.
She said it was hoped the final system, with differing levels of access, would be available ""by the end of this year"", but couldn't be more specific.
Some anti-corruption campaigners say more needs to be done.
Transparency International's Martini said Cyprus was ""super late"" in incorporating AML regulations into domestic law.
""It's still not going to be a public register, which is the current requirement at the EU level,"" Martini said.
And activists say for it to be truly effective, the UBO register should be linked to other databases, such as real estate ownership.

""It is more than just setting up a register,"" said Martini. ""Authorities should be able to search through the register as they see fit, not have to request the information, and then they should be able to integrate this information with other databanks.""

It was the second rocket attack in Iraq this month and came two days before Pope Francis is due to visit the country.
The attack caused no significant losses, Iraqi's military said without going into further detail.

In President Joe Biden's most direct challenge yet to the Kremlin, the United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions to punish Russia for what it described as Moscow's attempt to poison Navalny with a nerve agent last year.
Navalny, 44, fell ill on a flight in Siberia in August and was airlifted to Germany, where doctors concluded he had been poisoned with a nerve agent. The Kremlin has denied any role in his illness and said it has seen no proof he was poisoned.
Washington on Tuesday imposed sanctions against seven senior Russian officials and on 14 entities.
The United States acted in concert with the EU, which imposed largely symbolic sanctions on four senior Russian officials.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would hit back in a way that best served its interests. 
""Of course it's impossible not to apply the principle of reciprocity,"" Peskov told reporters.
""We consider such decisions to be absurd, unjustified and most importantly, they have no effect or meaning,"" he said. ""We can only regret this and express our bewilderment.""
However, Peskov said the U.S. sanctions would have no effect on the senior officials targeted because they are not allowed to travel outside Russia, own property abroad or hold foreign bank accounts anyway because of the sensitivity of their positions. 
""This is practically a duplication of the restrictions these people face under Russian law, nothing more,"" Peskov said, adding that sanctions targeting the entities would have more of a material effect. 
Regardless of their impact, Peskov warned that the sanctions would have a destructive effect on Russia's relationship with the United States and the European Union. 
Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia's Foreign Ministry, said late on Tuesday that the sanctions amounted to interference in Russia's internal affairs, and that Moscow would retaliate ""but not necessarily symmetrically.""
Russian officials have not said when Moscow will announce its reciprocal measures. 

Navalny was arrested at a Moscow airport in January on his return from Germany following treatment for poisoning with what many Western countries say was a nerve agent. He was jailed last month for violating parole on what he said were trumped-up charges, an assertion Russian authorities deny.

1246,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 06:37AM ET</span>","As U.S. interview nears, Meghan and Harry won't tango with UK tabloids","By Michael Holden and Sarah Mills
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry and American wife Meghan decided long ago they would not play the traditional royal media ""game"", and on Sunday they depart from the norms of engagement again with an in-depth interview with U.S. chat show host Oprah Winfrey.
Smarting from sometimes critical tabloid headlines and press intrusion in Britain, they have already announced they will step down from official duties, move to California with young son Archie and cut off contact with Britain's biggest tabloids.
Last month, Meghan successfully sued the Mail on Sunday for breaching her privacy by publishing parts of a letter she wrote to her father.
And on Tuesday, the couple issued a statement saying Meghan was ""saddened"" by a report in The Times broadsheet of a bullying complaint against her, calling it an ""attack on her character.""
To their supporters, Sunday's televised interview is a chance to set the record straight and lay out their plans for the future. To detractors, it's a sign of hypocrisy.
""They said they were leaving because they wanted privacy. And it seems in the last year that they've done very little other than seek publicity,"" said royal commentator Penny Junor.
When Harry, 36, and former actress Meghan, 39, married in a glittering ceremony in May 2018, they were feted as global celebrities, merging British royal allure and Hollywood glamour and attracting millions of followers on social media.
But beneath the surface, trouble was brewing. The couple had already complained that some reports about Meghan, whose father is white and mother is African-American, were vindictive or even racist.
VERY REAL SADNESS
Meghan called some media's approach to the British monarchy a ""game"".
""For these outlets, it's a game. For me and so many others, it's real life, real relationships, and very real sadness,"" Meghan said after her privacy claim victory. ""The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep.""
For Harry, it comes back to the death of his mother Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997 aged 36 when her limousine crashed as it sped away from chasing paparazzi photographers. He was 12.
""I will not be bullied into playing a game that's killed my mum,"" Harry told a TV documentary in October 2019, shortly before the announcement they were quitting royal duties. It is a theme he is set to return to in the interview with Winfrey.
""My biggest concern was history repeating itself,"" he said in a brief excerpt released by CBS.
Last week he told James Corden, British host of the U.S. TV programme ""The Late Late Show"", that he had left his homeland to escape the ""toxic"" press which he said was destroying his mental health.
Michelle Tauber, Senior Editor for People magazine, said to be successful in America, where the couple has settled, there needed to be a public sharing of personal triumphs and struggles, while there was also more understanding of their desire for privacy.
""I think Americans in particular are sympathetic to this idea of, it's theirs, it's done on their terms, it's their safe space to share what they want to share with the public,"" she said of the upcoming interview.
INTENSE SCRUTINY
Most senior members of the House of Windsor have at some stage been criticised and put under intense scrutiny by the media.
While newspapers want more pictures and personal access, the royals seek greater privacy, but also attention for issues close to their hearts. In return for a gilded life funded by the public, they should play along with the press, some critics say.
The tension can boil over. On an annual skiing trip in 2005, Harry's father Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, was caught on a microphone calling reporters ""bloody people"", and has previously bemoaned being treated as a ""performing monkey"".
""The royals need publicity and the newspapers, the media needs the family to fill their pages and the programmes. So it's a symbiotic relationship that has worked very well,"" said Junor.
Harry and Meghan's decision to keep the media at arm's length and try to get their message out directly through social media has led some British papers to become more overtly hostile.
Their recent announcement that Meghan was pregnant with their second child, their final split with the royal family and the upcoming interview have drawn criticism, especially at a time when Harry's grandfather Prince Philip, the queen's 99-year-old husband, is in hospital.
Veteran royal biographer Robert Jobson told MailOnline that it made the couple look ""heartless"".
Even some of those close to the royals suggest their public roles meant they must accept the enormous press interest, however wearying and frustrating.

""If you step on the pitch, you can't start arguing with the referee,"" one senior royal aide told Reuters.

1247,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 06:11AM ET</span>",Scottish leader fights back in row with ex-mentor that threatens independence drive,"By Elizabeth Piper and Estelle Shirbon
LONDON (Reuters) - Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon on Wednesday defended her handling of sexual harassment complaints against her predecessor Alex Salmond in high-stakes testimony on an issue that threatens to scupper her dream of leading Scotland to independence.
Describing the feud with Salmond as ""one of the most invidious political and personal situations"" she had ever faced, Sturgeon denied Salmond's accusations that she had plotted against him and misled the Scottish parliament.
The feud between the pair, once close friends and powerful allies in the cause of Scottish independence, has reached fever pitch in recent weeks, threatening the electoral prospects of the Scottish National Party (SNP) at a crucial time.
With Scottish elections coming up in May, Sturgeon believes a strong showing for her party would give her a mandate to demand a second referendum on independence, after one in 2014 in which Scots voted by 55% to 45% to stay in the United Kingdom.
With Britain's exit from the European Union boosting pro-independence sentiment in Scotland, where a majority voted against Brexit, a series of opinion polls have suggested the SNP could well win a second independence referendum.
But a relentless torrent of negative and sometimes lurid headlines about the Sturgeon-Salmond row could deprive her of the emphatic win she needs to overcome resistance by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who opposes a referendum.
In highly anticipated testimony to an inquiry into how she and her government handled the sexual harassment claims against Salmond, which he denies, Sturgeon denied any improper behaviour, saying she had ""searched her soul"" many times.
""In one of the most invidious political and personal situations I have ever faced, I believe I acted properly and appropriately, and overall, I made the best judgments I could,"" she told lawmakers. 
""For anyone, at least anyone willing to listen with an open mind, that is what I will seek to demonstrate today,"" she said, before beginning a detailed defence of her individual decisions, expected to last most of the day.
ME TOO
In his own explosive testimony on Friday, Salmond accused Sturgeon in taking part in a malicious plot to drive him out of public life, and of breaking the ministerial code, a set of rules on how ministers should behave, in the process.
Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross has also accused Sturgeon of lying and has called for a vote of no confidence against her.
Denying that she had broken the code, a transgression that would normally lead to a resignation, Sturgeon hit back hard, rejecting Salmond's talk of a plot as absurd and linking the saga to the broader context of the ""me too"" movement.
""As first minister, I refused to follow the age-old pattern of allowing a powerful man to use his status and connections to get what he wants,"" she said, accusing Salmond of having asked her to intervene in his favour after women complained about him.
She said he had failed to recognise how difficult the situation was ""first and foremost for women who believed his behaviour towards them was inappropriate, but also for those of us who have campaigned with him, worked with him, cared for him and considered him a friend, and who now stand unfairly accused of plotting against him"".

Salmond stood trial on charges of sexual assault and was acquitted last year.

MADRID (Reuters) - Thousands of kilometres (miles) away from his native Venezuela, 48-year-old Nestor Perez died last month on the streets of Madrid when he was hit by a garbage truck while delivering a food order for Deliveroo.
Such tragedies have cast a spotlight on the precarious conditions of often immigrant workers in Spain's gig economy at a time when the government, ahead of its European peers, is drafting legislation to regulate the sector.
It is the latest challenge to the freewheeling gig economy model in Europe after a landmark UK ruling requiring Uber (NYSE:UBER) to pay the minimum wage to its drivers, with the European Union set to propose an EU-wide regulatory framework by year-end. 
Spain aims to bolster protections for service sector workers typically hired on freelance basis by requiring employers to put them on staff contracts, government and union sources said. 
The move was spurred by a Supreme Court ruling in September that people working for Barcelona-based food delivery app Glovo were employees, not freelancers, a decision that could enable such workers to demand formal labour contracts and benefits. 
Legislative intervention to counter the legal vacuum that makes jobs in the service sector so poorly paid and insecure is welcome news for gig workers, at first glance. 
""It would be nice for me to have a contract and a fixed salary,"" said Rana Azad, 28, a Barcelona delivery rider. He said he has been on duty for up to 10 hours a day recently but earning only 10-15 euros per shift. ""This doesn't help me to live, to eat, to support my family,"" he told Reuters. 
Details of a regulatory regime for gig employment are being discussed with Spanish unions and business associations and could be unveiled as early as this week, government and union sources said. 
""Brussels sees our proposal as going in the right direction,"" a government source, referring to the EU executive.
But labour and legal experts fear that the main consequence of the legislation, rather than full staff contracts with gig companies, could be an ever greater reliance of the service sector on subcontractors and temporary work agencies.
The new law will not spare riders from the costly, possibly unaffordable, necessity of going to court if delivery app companies do not hire their staff directly, said labour rights lawyer Adrian Todoli.
""These new models of subcontracting they are creating, and which might be fraudulent, will have to go through the judicial process again until they are declared illegal by the courts.""
WORKAROUND TACTICS?
A source in the delivery sector said that if companies were obliged by law to put riders on staff, they would likely work around this by recruiting them via temporary job agencies.
Branches of large multinationals in the gig sector, such as Deliveroo and Uber, have criticised the legislative initiative, saying it would strip riders of their independence in choosing when and where to work. 
Some riders were also doubtful about the legislation's impact.
“Okay, it's fine to have insurance and a fixed salary, but what if we need more money? We can't tell the boss of Uber or Glovo to raise our salary or give us more overtime. No, we can't say that, there is no way to do it,” said Manzurul Hoque, 19, a Bangladeshi rider in Barcelona.
When he died, Nestor Perez was working for an intermediary firm without having a personal Deliveroo account - one of many examples of how gig companies try to avoid having riders on their, and the responsibility for their working conditions.
Such outsourcing of labour could be illegal in Spain if a firm outsources its workers exclusively to a third party, unless it is a recognised temporary placement agency, said Ana Ercoreca, president of the labour inspectors union.
Government sources and major unions said their preferred approach was the one being implemented by Just Eat's Spanish branch, whose parent company is Dutch-based Takeaway.
""Our model is that our workers have an employment contract. Either we hire them directly or through logistics companies,"" said Patrik Bergareche, Just Eat's managing director in Spain, referring to messenger and courier services. 
Gonzalo Pino of the UGT union that is negotiating gig worker regulation with the government said it backed Just Eat's hybrid model as long as it entailed collective bargain agreements.
But some riders' groups prefer all workers to be hired directly by online delivery companies. That would mean social security costs amounting to about a third of payroll, paying at least the minimum wage and providing the means to do the job - for instance a motorbike to deliver food.
In Nestor Perez's case, two sources familiar with the investigation into his death said the outsourcing of his work via a Deliveroo account owned by someone else was legally vague.
His brother Ronald told Reuters from Caracas that Deliveroo had helped pay the funeral expenses but the family had struggled to contact the online account holder for whom Nestor worked.
Ronald Perez said the family was considering court action. ""Even if we sue, we are not going to get a life back. But we want to set a precedent,"" he said, without specifying what the objective of a lawsuit would be.

Deliveroo said it would ""support"" Perez's family, but declined to elaborate.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis said on Wednesday he is going to Iraq, where his predecessor John Paul was not allowed to go in 2000, because ""the people cannot be let down for a second time.""
Speaking at the end of his general audience, Francis, who is due to start the risky trip in Baghdad on Friday, asked for prayers so that the visit ""can take place in the best possible way and bring about the desired fruits"".
He made no mention of the deteriorating security situation in Iraq, where earlier on Wednesday at least 10 rockets landed on an air base that hosts United States, coalition and Iraqi forces. 
Pope John Paul had to cancel a planned trip in 2000 after a breakdown in talks with the government of then leader Saddam Hussein.
""For some time I have wanted to meet that people who suffered so much, and meet that martyred Church,"" Francis said.
Iraq's minority Christian community has been devastated by wars and repression by Islamic State insurgents. Francis will visit the former Islamic State stronghold of Mosul, where churches still bear the signs of conflict.
""The people of Iraq are waiting for us. They were waiting for St. Pope John Paul II, who was not allowed to go. The people cannot be let down for a second time. Let us pray that this trip can be carried out well,"" he said.
Francis will also visit Ur, birthplace of the prophet Abraham, who is revered by Christians, Moslems and Jews, and meet Iraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, 90. 
""In the land of Abraham, together with other religious leaders, we also will take another step forward in fraternity among believers,"" Francis said.
Al-Sistani is one of the most important figures in Shi'ite Islam, both within Iraq and beyond. He commands a vast following among Iraq's Shi'ite majority and huge influence over politics and public opinion.
About 10,000 security forces will be deployed to protect the pope, who will mostly likely be travelling in armoured vehicles.

The number of people who will be able to see him has been severely limited because of coronavirus restrictions.

Dillo, who plans to run against President Idriss Deby in a presidential election in April said he was attacked at home by members of the presidential guard and that five family members were killed, including his mother.
France, the former colonial power, has close ties with Deby. It considers Chad as pivotal in the fight against Islamist militants in West Africa and its 5,100-strong counter-terrorism Operation Barkhane force has a base in the capital N'djamena, as does the United States. 
""Dillo had two arrest warrants issued against him and offered resistance, but that is not an excuse for the deaths of several people,"" Jean-Yves Le Drian told a parliamentary hearing late on Tuesday.
""We call on Chad to quickly carry out an independent and impartial investigation so light can be shed on this tragic event.""
Dillo is a formal rebel leader who fought against Deby in 2006 before joining his government and becoming a minister.
He is one of 16 people who have announced they will run against Deby in April.
Deby, in power since 1990, pushed through a new constitution in 2018 that reinstated term limits but could let him stay in power until 2033.
Underscoring Deby's importance for Paris, French warplanes struck a rebel convoy in northern Chad in February 2019, helping local troops repel an incursion across the border from Libya. 

""There will be elections on April 11 and we have told Chadian authorities several times to guarantee opposition participation, freedom to gather and media access. It's essential for Chad's stability,"" Le Drian said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Jeff Sessions, the top official behind former President Donald Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" border strategy, says it was ""unfortunate"" that migrant children and parents were not reunited quickly after being split apart at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Thousands of children were separated from their parents at the border under the 2018 Trump policy, which charged parents with federal immigration offenses and sent them to jails, while children were labeled ""unaccompanied"" and placed in shelters.
In a phone interview on Tuesday, Sessions defended the prosecutions, saying a person traveling with a child ""shouldn't be given immunity."" He expressed regret, however, that the Trump administration could not quickly reunite the parents and children afterward.
""It was unfortunate, very unfortunate, that somehow the government was not able to manage those children in a way that they could be reunited properly,"" Sessions said. ""It turned out to be more of a problem than I think any of us imagined it would be.""
Launched in April 2018, Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" policy provoked widespread criticism, leading the Republican president to effectively reverse it months later. President Joe Biden, a Democrat who took office on Jan. 20, created a task force in February to reunite families still separated by the policy, calling it a ""stain"" on the reputation of the United States.
Efforts are still ongoing in court to locate the parents of more than 500 separated children.
Trump publicly criticized Sessions during his time as attorney general for recusing himself from overseeing a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Still, Sessions aggressively implemented Trump's hardline immigration agenda before being ousted by Trump in November 2018.
A U.S. Department of Justice internal watchdog report released in January said Sessions' office was ""a driving force"" in the Trump administration decision to refer families for criminal prosecution and that Sessions himself was aware it could lead to family separations.

The report said the attorney general's office did not sufficiently coordinate with other agencies, underestimated the complexity of the policy and ""demonstrated a deficient understanding of the legal requirements related to the care and custody of separated children.""

The militant group, which has a presence in Afghanistan, said its fighters had targeted the three female employees of a television station in the eastern city of Jalalabad on Tuesday evening, according to the SITE Intelligence group.
The women, who worked for local broadcaster Enikas TV, were aged between 18 and 20 and were shot on their way home from work, according to Afghan officials. Their burials took place on Wednesday after prayer ceremonies, according to a provincial council member.
A fourth women wounded in the attack was admitted to hospital in a critical condition, hospitals officials.
Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack, which local police initially blamed on the insurgent Taliban, who denied any involvement.
""Such attacks on our innocent compatriots, especially women, contradict the teachings of Islam, Afghan culture and the spirit of peace, and make the current crisis and war difficult and long,"" said a statement from Ghani's office. 
Violence has risen around Afghanistan and media workers and civil society members in urban areas have been targeted in recent months even as a peace process takes place in Qatar's capital of Doha.

The Afghan government and the Taliban have been holding talks to try to reach a political settlement to end decades of conflict. But progress has slowed as the new Biden administration in Washington reviews its plans for the peace process, including whether to entirely withdraw troops by May as originally planned.

ZURICH (Reuters) - ""Stop Extremism!"" urges a red billboard in a quiet village outside Zurich above an image of a scowling woman wearing a black headscarf and face veil.
The billboard is part of a campaign by the far-right Swiss People's Party (SVP) to ban face coverings in public and which will be voted on in a binding national referendum on Sunday. Opinion polls suggest most Swiss will back it and the ban will become law.
""In Switzerland our tradition is that you show your face. That is a sign of our basic freedoms,"" said Walter Wobmann, an SVP member of parliament and chairman of the referendum committee.
The proposal predates the COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen all adults forced to don masks in many settings to prevent the spread of infection. It gathered the necessary support to trigger a referendum in 2017. 
It does not mention Islam directly, and also aims to stop violent street protesters and football hooligans wearing masks. Still, local politicians, media and campaigners have dubbed it the burqa ban.
The proposal compounds Switzerland's tense relationship with Islam after citizens voted to ban building any new minarets in 2009. Two cantons already have local bans on face coverings. 
Wobmann said the vote was not against Islam itself, but added, ""the facial covering is a symbol for this extreme, political Islam which has become increasingly prominent in Europe and which has no place in Switzerland."" 
France banned wearing a full face veil in public in 2011 and Denmark, Austria the Netherlands and Bulgaria have full or partial bans on wearing face coverings in public. 
No one in Switzerland wears a burqa and only around 30 women wear the niqab, the University of Lucerne estimates. Muslims make up 5.2% of the Swiss population of 8.6 million people, with most having their roots in Turkey, Bosnia and Kosovo. 
Swiss Muslims have said right-wing parties were using the vote to rally their supporters and demonise them and others have warned a ban could stoke wider divisions.
""The niqab is a blank sheet which allows people to project their fears onto it,"" said Andreas Tunger-Zanetti, manager of Lucerne University's Centre for Research on Religion.
""But ... you are very unlikely to meet someone on a Swiss street wearing one.""
He said a ban risked cementing Switzerland's image as anti-Islamic and could create resentment amongst some Muslims.
Rifa'at Lenzin, 67, a Swiss Muslim woman, said she was totally against the ban, which was tackling a problem which didn't exist, in a country where Muslims were well integrated.
""Changing the constitution to tell people what they can and cannot wear is a very bad idea.. This is Switzerland, not Saudi Arabia.""
""We are Muslims but we are Swiss citizens who have grown up here too,"" Lenzin said. ""This vote is simply racist and Islamophobic.""

ALQOSH, Iraq (Reuters) - Nestled in a steep rocky hillside among the remote mountains of northern Iraq, the Rabban Hormizd Monastery has watched invaders come and go through Christianity's tumultuous history in this corner of ancient Mesopotamia.
    Mongols, Persians, Arabs, Kurds and Ottomans have sacked, surrounded or occupied the seventh century monastery and the Christian town of Alqosh, above which it perches, near the borders with Turkey, Syria and Iran.
    But Christians there survived the latest onslaught, this time by Islamic State militants who took over one third of Iraq between 2014 and 2017, including the city of Mosul just 20 miles (32 km) to the south.
Mercifully for them, a string of villages just above Mosul was as far north as the group got, sparing Alqosh the brutality inflicted on minority faiths and sects. Some families fled those villages to the safety of the town.
""This will remain a Christian town, I believe. We have to stay in this land,"" said Brother Saad Yohanna, an Iraqi monk working at a local orphanage.
    ""Far fewer people live here these days - maybe 1,000 families from 3,000 a few years ago, but it remains home for them.""
    Residents and local Christians regularly make the winding hike up to the monastery to pray or seek solace.
    For them, the town, its monasteries and churches are a sanctuary for life and worship in a country where they say Christian existence is threatened.
Of the 1.5 million Christians in Iraq before the U.S. invasion in 2003, only around a fifth remain, the others driven out by sectarian violence first by al Qaeda and then Islamic State.
    The displaced who remain will get rare recognition this week, as Pope Francis visits the country from March 5-8. The closest he will get to Alqosh is a cluster of demolished churches in Mosul, once Islamic State's de facto capital.
SYMBOL OF ENDURANCE
Yohanna was among those who left Alqosh when Islamic State took Mosul and several Christian-inhabited towns to the south. He returned two weeks later as Alqosh emerged unscathed.
    Some families from surrounding areas made the town their permanent home. Their villages are now under the control of Shi'ite Muslim militias who helped the Iraqi army defeat Islamic State in 2017.
    ""People opened their doors to us as fellow Christians fleeing Daesh, and helped us to get our lives back together,"" said Maysun Habib, a mother of seven from the nearby Tel Keyf area. Daesh is an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.
    ""Alqosh is protected, it's not exposed or controlled by militia,"" she added.
    Control of Alqosh itself, after centuries of change, remains unresolved. It lies along disputed territory between the Baghdad central government and the self-run Kurdistan region.
It is in Baghdad's Nineveh province, but controlled by Kurdish forces who helped drive Islamic State away.
    Habib's family is among some 100 from nearby areas who now worship in Alqosh's churches, and occasionally at a chapel that remains usable at the monastery.
    They see the mountainside retreat as a rare symbol of Christian endurance, spared the desecration wrought by Islamic State in other parts of northern Iraq.
The country's oldest monastery of St Elijah, near Mosul, was damaged during the 2003 conflict before Islamic State destroyed it just over a decade later.
    Rabban Hormizd Monastery, named after its founder, was built when Muslim armies were conquering the Middle East, and fortified over time. Dotted around its high brick walls are caves where monks once cloistered and prayed.
    It became an important centre of the Eastern Catholic clergy from the 16th to 19th century, although monks gradually moved out to more accessible digs, including a second monastery in the town.
It is open now to visitors, worshippers and local monks, but not inhabited.
    Shatha Tawfiq, a woman who moved to Alqosh, summed up the mood among local Christians ahead of the first ever papal visit to Iraq.

    ""Our situation in Iraq is not good, but I feel at home here.""

China last week stopped the import of Taiwanese pineapples, citing ""harmful creatures"" it said could come with the fruit.
Taiwan's infuriated government called the ban a political move to further pressure the Chinese-claimed island, a charge that China denied.
Tsai, who has launched a ""pineapple challenge"" on her social media pages to get Taiwanese to buy more of the fruit, told reporters at the headquarters of the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) that their strategy was paying off.
Since Friday when China announced the ban, orders for more than 41,000 metric tons of pineapples have come in, including 5,000 metric tons from Japan, she said.
""From crisis comes turning points. In the face of each challenge Taiwan will not be defeated but will become even stronger,"" she said, standing in front of pineapple products from Taiwan's four main producing areas in its south.
""As long as we unite and support the hard-working farmers and support our high quality products, the international community will stand on the same frontlines as Taiwan.""
Taiwan has been heartened by support from the United States and Canada in particular for what Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu has called ""freedom pineapples"", with the two countries' de facto ambassadors in Taipei posting pictures on social media with the fruit.
Around 90% of Taiwan's pineapple exports went to China last year, though most production is consumed domestically.
Local politicians have been posting pictures of themselves in fields with farmers and tucking into the fruit on their social media pages, encouraging domestic consumers as well as other countries to pick up the slack left by China.

Musician and activist Chaiamorn ""Ammy"" Kaewwiboonpan, 32 was arrested in Ayutthaya province north of Bangkok and is accused of setting fire to the portrait on Sunday in front of a Bangkok prison where four prominent activists are being held.
Chaiamorn is charged under a strict lese majeste law that carries a penalty of up to 15 years in prison if found guilty, as well as arson and trespassing on government property.
""We have both witnesses and forensic evidence,"" Bangkok police chief Pakapong Pongpetra told a news conference, adding Chaiamorn was not the only person suspected of involvement. 
Chaiamorn was receiving medical treatment at a hospital for an injury unrelated to his arrest, police said.
His lawyer Sasinan Thamnithinan said he would be granted access to Chaiamorn later on Wednesday when police take a statement from his client.
Months of youth-led protest against the military-backed government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha last year also broke traditional taboos by calling for reform of the powerful monarchy. 
At least 61 people has subsequently been charged with lese majeste, based on data compiled by legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights.
Four of those are prominent protest leaders currently in prison awaiting trial.
The portrait burning took place the same day, hours before protesters marched on a Bangkok military base to call for the king to give up direct control over army units transferred to him in 2019 by the government of Prayuth, a former military chief.

Police used rubber bullets against the youth-led protesters for the first time on Sunday, as well as tear gas and water cannon.

ISLAMABAD/KARACHI (Reuters) - The ruling party of Prime Minister Imran Khan and his political allies will seek to wrest control of Pakistan's Senate from opposition parties on Wednesday in indirect elections to 37 seats in the 104-member upper house of the country's parliament.
Though his party won the 2018 general election, Khan's coalition does not have a majority in the Senate, needed to pass key legislation - including legal reforms sought by global institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and money laundering watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
""They have difficulty in legislating, and many laws are stuck,"" Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, head of the independent research organisation PILDAT, told Reuters.
Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI), which translates into Pakistan Movement for Justice, has 12 seats in the Senate, and the two main opposition parties Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (PML-N) have 12 and 25 seats each.
PTI is looking to go up to 25 seats after the elections, and, along with other coalition parties and independents, have a slender majority in the Senate.
The electoral college for the Senate elections, which are held every three years on half of the chamber's strength, comprises Pakistan's four provincial assemblies and the lower house of parliament.
With opposition parties controlling the Senate, the government has had to pass interim legislation through Presidential Ordinances, which expire in 120 days.
The government's legislators and allies in the lower house of parliament will vote on making Khan's finance minister, Abdul Hafiz Sheikh, a senator. The result could show how much confidence there is in the administration. 
""It could determine who has a majority in parliament... it will be an embarrassment for the government, and could even lead to seeking a fresh vote of confidence,"" Mehboob said.

The lead up to the potentially pivotal election has been marked by the government and opposition charging each other with seeking votes through unfair means.

The company said the endorsement by Modi and other ministers would set an example for other Indians and reduce ""vaccine hesitancy"". It is seeking to sell COVAXIN to countries including Brazil and the Philippines.

COVAXIN and the AstraZeneca vaccines were approved by India's regulator in January.

In President Joe Biden's most direct challenge yet to the Kremlin, the United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions to punish Russia for what it described as Moscow's attempt to poison opposition politician Alexei Navalny with a nerve agent last year.
Navalny, 44, fell ill on a flight in Siberia in August and was airlifted to Germany, where doctors concluded he had been poisoned with a nerve agent. The Kremlin has denied any role in his illness and said it has seen no proof he was poisoned.
Washington on Tuesday imposed sanctions against seven senior Russian officials and on 14 entities.
""All this is just an excuse to continue overt interference in our internal affairs,"" Maria Zakharova, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, said in a statement.
""We do not intend to put up with this. We will respond based on the principle of reciprocity, but not necessarily symmetrically.""
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that Moscow would respond in kind to any new U.S. sanctions, while Russia's envoy to the European Union also promised a response to EU sanctions on four senior Russian officials.
Zakharova said the U.S. was free to choose whether it wanted ""equal dialogue"" with Russia on a reasonable basis, but said Moscow would pay no attention to any sanctions, which she said had failed in their aims in the past and would do so again now.

""Irrespective of America's 'sanctions addiction', we will continue to consistently and decisively defend our national interests, rebuffing any aggression. We urge our colleagues not to play with fire,"" said Zakharova.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian conservationists on Wednesday unveiled plans to build the world's first refuge for the platypus, to promote breeding and rehabilitation as the duck-billed mammal faces extinction due to climate change.
The Taronga Conservation Society Australia and the New South Wales State government said they would build the specialist facility, mostly ponds and burrows for the semiaquatic creatures, at a zoo 391 km (243 miles) from Sydney, by 2022, which could house up to 65 platypuses.
""There is so much to learn about the platypus and we know so little,"" Taronga CEO Cameron Kerr told reporters.
""These facilities will be critical in building our knowledge so that we don't let this iconic creature slip off the earth.""
Concerns about the platypus going extinct have been heightened since once-in-a-generation wildfires devastated 12.6 million hectares (31 million acres) of bush, nearly the size of Greece, in late 2019 and early 2020.
Scientists estimate nearly three billion animals died in what the prime minister called the country's ""black summer"". A government inquiry found bushfires would likely occur more often because of warming temperatures.
Unlike other famous Australian animals such as the koala or kangaroo, the beaver-like platypus is rarely seen in the wild due to its reclusive nature and highly specific habitat needs.
The furry, web-footed animal, along with the echnidna, is one of just two egg-laying mammals, and generally lives around small streams and slow-moving rivers in cooler temperatures.
""The refuge ... will give us a chance to really learn about what sort of environments they like, and what is most likely to encourage them to breed,"" said Kerr.
The 2019-20 bushfires followed several years of drought, and Taronga had noted beforehand an increased number of platypuses with ""climate-related injuries and illnesses"", it said in a statement.
Last year, a separate inquiry found that koalas would be extinct in New South Wales by 2050, due to deforestation for farming and urban development.

The platypus is classified as a protected species in Australia, and Taronga said that without intervention, the animal may follow a few decades later.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australian Attorney-General Christian Porter, the country's chief law officer, identified himself on Wednesday as the subject of a historical rape allegation, declaring his innocence and strongly denying the claim.
Politicians who last week received an anonymous allegation of an assault in 1988 had referred material to federal police. On Tuesday, police in New South Wales state, where the alleged assault occurred, said there was insufficient evidence to investigate the claim and closed the matter.
Seeking to end swirling speculation about the identity of the unnamed cabinet minister since the allegation was first reported last week, an emotional Porter said he was the subject of the claim. He said the incident had never happened and he said he had not had a sexual relationship with the woman involved.
""I can only say to you that it didn't happen,"" Porter told a media conference in Perth, adding he was being asked to ""disprove something that didn't happen 33 years ago.""
Porter said all he knew about the allegation was what he had read in the media, but the details of the claim had never been put to him.
He said he would not resign his ministerial position, but would take leave for a couple of weeks to ""assess and hopefully improve"" his mental health.
Police had said the allegation could not be investigated because the alleged victim did not make a formal statement to them detailing her account before she committed suicide last year.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he had spoken to the then unnamed minister who had ""vigorously rejected"" the allegation.
Porter said he had the backing of Morrison.
Australia's Minister for Industrial Relations Michaelia Cash will stand in as acting Attorney-General while Porter takes leave, a spokesman for Morrison said.
The government has been under pressure over its handling of unrelated allegations by three former staff members of the ruling Liberal party that they had been raped by an unidentified colleague.

One victim who went public with her allegations has made an official police complaint.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Bail proceedings for 47 Hong Kong democracy activists charged with conspiracy to commit subversion enter the third day on Wednesday, following marathon hearings that have gone on late into the night and led to some defendants falling ill.
The charges are the most sweeping use yet of the national security law that Beijing imposed on the global financial hub in June 2020.
Defence lawyers are applying for bail and challenging a prosecution bid to keep the defendants in custody for months while police investigate further. The hearing resumes at noon (0400 GMT).
In contrast with Hong Kong's common law traditions, the new security law puts the onus on defendants to prove they will not pose a security threat if released on bail. 
If remanded to custody, the move will mean that most of Hong Kong's opposition figures are either in jail or in exile.
The activists are accused of organising and participating in an unofficial primary poll last July that authorities said was part of a plan to ""overthrow"" the government. 
The election was aimed at selecting the strongest candidates for a legislative council election that the government later postponed, citing the coronavirus.
'IT'S A TEST'
The marathon hearings, unusual in length, have seen five of the defendants falling ill and needing medical assistance over the first two days. Hong Kong laws restrict media coverage of the content of bail hearings.
Foreign diplomats and rights groups are closely monitoring the case amid mounting concerns over the independence of the former British colony's vaunted judicial system that is seen as the foundation on which its financial prowess was built.
""We’ve not seen something like this before. It’s usually very fast ... It’s very strange,"" said Consul General of Ireland David Costello, who was at the court, of the length of the hearings.
""It’s a test of what’s going to happen in Hong Kong.""
Supporters of the security law, which punishes what it broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, say it is necessary to restore stability in Hong Kong.
On Monday, about 1,000 supporters defied social gathering rules to curb coronavirus and rallied outside the West Kowloon courthouse as the defendants appeared to face charges following their arrest over the weekend.
The crowds have since subsided.
""I feel powerless, that our support would not help the case. I just want the defendants to feel supported,"" said 19-year-old Chan, who was among a few dozen supporters at the court, giving only his last name due to the sensitivity of the matter.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - One in five Chinese Australians say they have been physically threatened or attacked in the past year because of the COVID-19 pandemic and tensions in Australia's relationship with China, a survey by the Lowy Institute think tank reported. 
The findings prompted a call from the Chinese Australian Forum, a community group, for national leadership to tackle racism as Australia deals with a more assertive China, and also recognition that the Chinese community in Australia is diverse in its political views and origins.
Around 5% of Australia's population of 25 million claim Chinese ancestry, the national census shows. Half of the Lowy survey respondents were born outside mainland China, in places including Hong Kong, Malaysia and Taiwan.
""Chinese Australians were always going to be sandwiched in geopolitical tensions with (China),"" said president of the Chinese Australian Forum, Jason Li. 
""How we manage the rising distrust towards 1.4 million of our fellow Australians will be a significant test of our multiculturalism and our values as an open, liberal society."" 
Three-quarters of respondents said Australia was a good or very good place to live.
The survey came as the Chinese embassy published a speech by deputy head of mission Wang Xining, who attacked ""scumbags"" in Australia who criticised the Chinese government.
""Those scumbags who deliberately slander China, undermine Sino-Australian friendship and harm the well-being of the two peoples out of self-interest will be cast aside by the world, and their descendants will be ashamed to mention their negative role in history,"" Wang told the Australia China Business Council dinner. 
The embassy has previously listed its grievances against Australia as including Canberra's call for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, the bar on Chinese telecommunications company Huaweiparticipating in the 5G network, and restricting foreign investment on national security grounds.
FOREIGN INTERFERENCE
Australia introduced a foreign interference law in 2018 that has increased scrutiny of political donations by Chinese Australians and led to a police raid on Chinese media outlets.
Half of respondents to the Lowy survey said they were concerned about China's influence on Australian political processes, and half said the media and politicians paid the ""right amount"" or ""too little"" attention to the issue.
Australia's public broadcaster, the ABC, launched a Chinese-language Youtube video channel this week offering Australian news, after concerns from government and some community groups about Chinese government influence on Chinese language media outlets in Australia.
Li said the survey's finding that seven out of 10 Chinese Australians feel a sense of belonging to Australia ""vindicates the strength of Australia's multiculturalism"".
A similar number of Chinese Australians said they felt a sense of belonging to the Chinese people (68%).
The survey also found strong support (65%) for Australia working to find other markets to reduce its economic dependence on China.

It is the first time the Lowy Institute has conducted the Being Chinese in Australia survey of around 1,000 people, mostly recruited on social media, which included Australian citizens, permanent residents and a large number of long-term visa holders. It was funded by the Australian government.

Maduro did not provide details about what changes might be made by the congress, controlled by allies of his ruling socialist party after a December vote widely boycotted by the opposition.
Venezuela's crude output has plunged in recent years due to under-investment and mismanagement, and more recently due to U.S. sanctions aimed at ousting Maduro, labeled a dictator by Washington.
Maduro's comments come as officials have proposed allowing private companies a greater role in the oil industry in the member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, in a break from the state-run model preferred by Maduro's predecessor and mentor, the late former President Hugo Chavez.
The oil law was among dozens that the National Assembly resolved to reform during its session on Tuesday. The congress also pledged to consider laws reforming Venezuela's mining sector and to create ""special economic zones."" 
Under current oil legislation, state company Petroleos de Venezuela is required to hold a majority stake in joint ventures with foreign and private companies, and has a monopoly on crude oil marketing.
The country's political opposition has long advocated for allowing greater private sector participation.

But the opposition, led by Juan Guaido, largely chose not to participate in the December vote because it argued there were no guarantees the vote would be free and fair. Guaido does not recognize the Maduro-aligned National Assembly as legitimate, and has named his own committee of allied lawmakers to continue carrying out the functions of the legislature.

Zhu Zhengfu, a member of the national committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), told the paper China should promote mutual recognition of such vaccine passports globally to boost international tourism and economic exchanges. 
Zhu also told the Global Times, published by the ruling Chinese Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper, that international arrivals could be exempted from quarantine requirements if they have a negative nucleic acid test and a vaccine passport. 
The annual meetings of China's rubber-stamp parliament, National People's Congress (NPC), and its advisory body CPPCC are set to begin on Friday and Thursday, respectively. Delegates attending these NPC and CPPCC meetings submit proposals for new legislation or regulation for consideration during this time, though they do not all become law.
The paper said Witman Hung Wai-man, a NPC deputy, also proposed the central government issue vaccine passports that will be recognized in the mainland and Hong Kong. Residents of the city with such a passport and a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result should be able to travel to the mainland without being subject to the quarantine requirements, he said. 
China has largely managed to subdue COVID-19 after the initial outbreak that emerged in late 2019 and paralysed most of the country early last year.
The pandemic has since taken hold around the world and claimed nearly 2.65 million lives globally to date.

Washington and dozens of other countries recognized Guaido as Venezuela's rightful leader in January 2019 after Guaido, the leader of the opposition-held National Assembly, invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing President Nicolas Maduro's 2018 re-election was fraudulent.
In his call with Guaido, Blinken ""stressed the importance of a return to democracy in Venezuela through free and fair elections,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.
Maduro, who has held onto power backed by the South American country's military and allies including Russia, China and Cuba, argues Guaido is a U.S. puppet seeking to oust him in a coup. 
Price said Guaido and Blinken discussed the ""urgent humanitarian needs in Venezuela,"" which is suffering a years-long economic crisis.
Blinken described U.S. efforts to work with the European Union, the Organization of American States and other groups ""to increase multilateral pressure and press for a peaceful, democratic transition,"" Price said.
Guaido told an Argentine television channel on Tuesday evening that he had spoken with Blinken and Canadian Foreign Minister Marc Garneau ""as part of the agenda of international alliances to rescue democracy in Venezuela."" 

A White House official told Reuters over the weekend that the Biden administration was in ""no rush"" to lift U.S. sanctions on Venezuela imposed by former President Donald Trump but would consider easing them if Maduro takes confidence-building steps showing he is ready to negotiate seriously with the opposition.

But the presidents of Mexico and the United States quickly found common ground in a virtual ""meeting"" on Monday, in the form of the Virgin of Guadalupe.
Mexico's patron saint is one of the most beloved symbols of national identity in a country where most people share U.S. President Joe Biden's Roman Catholic faith.
Biden, the second Catholic U.S. president, opened his remarks noting that he had ""paid respects"" to the Virgin of Guadalupe on trips to Mexico, and wore a rosary from her namesake basilica that belonged to his late son. 
""As a matter of fact, I still have my rosary beads that my son was wearing when he passed,"" Biden said, lifting his wrist to show them.
Beau Biden died of brain cancer at age 46 in 2015 - one of several family tragedies that have touched the president's life, and that he often weaves into emotional public speeches.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday praised Biden's openness in the video conference.
""From the outset, this confession that he wears a rosary, the mention of the Virgin of Guadalupe,"" Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference. ""I mean, he didn't come off as a cardboard politician, rigid, but rather as a man of feeling."" 
The Mexican bishops' conference hailed Biden's ""devotion"" to the Lady of Guadalupe, a Virgin Mary figure who, according to legend, appeared to an Aztec man in 1531 a decade after the Spanish conquest of Mexico.
Traditional imagery of the Virgin of Guadalupe, in which she wears a blue robe flecked with golden stars, is a common sight in churches and shrines throughout Mexico and is widely referenced in pop culture.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon expressed concern on Tuesday about a U.N. report indicating possible reprocessing of nuclear fuel for bombs by North Korea, and said such activity could raise tensions with Pyongyang.
Rear Admiral Michael Studeman, head of intelligence for the U.S. Indo-Pacific command, said North Korean activity highlighted this week by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) could be intended to get the attention of the Biden administration and as a bargaining chip to press for sanctions relief. The administration is currently reviewing U.S.-North Korea policy. 
""We have our eye on this. And it is deeply concerning where North Korea wants to go,"" Studeman told an virtual event on technology and security.
In a statement to the IAEA Board of Governors on Monday, the United Nations body's director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, made reference to activity at North Korea's Yongbyong and Kangson nuclear facilities.
He said there had been recent indications of operation of a steam plant that serves a radiochemical laboratory. North Korea has used its radiochemical lab at Yongbyon to reprocess plutonium from a reactor there for nuclear bombs.
Grossi called North Korea's continued nuclear activity a clear violation of U.N. sanctions and ""deeply regrettable.""
Referring to Grossi's statement, Studeman said: ""the IAEA board of governors issued a notice that there had been evidence of the Koreans reprocessing perhaps nuclear fuel.
""If that is true, then that could put us into a different level of tension with Korea,"" he said.
""This may be the start of something that's designed to influence the Biden administration; it may be the first way of getting the new administration's attention here, where perhaps (North Korea) would use this reprocessing development as a bargaining chip for sanctions relief of some sort.""
The administration of President Joe Biden, which took office in January, is conducting a full review of North Korea policy following former President Donald Trump's unprecedented engagement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which failed to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.
Biden's Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the approach to North Korea could involve more sanctions or unspecified diplomatic incentives. 
A confidential U.N. report seen by Reuters last month said North Korea developed its nuclear and ballistic missile programs throughout 2020.
Jenny Town, deputy director of the Washington-based North Korea monitoring project 38 North, told Reuters satellite images it had received of Yongbyon from Feb. 17 and March 2 showed steam coming from the laboratory there, which had not been known to be in operation for about two years.
""It doesn't necessarily mean that reprocessing has started, but it could be an indication of preparations for that,"" she said.

North Korea uses both uranium and plutonium for nuclear weapons, but the latter allows for smaller, lighter bombs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions to punish Russia for what it described as Moscow's attempt to poison opposition leader Alexei Navalny with a nerve agent last year, in President Joe Biden's most direct challenge yet to the Kremlin.
The sanctions against seven senior Russian officials, among them the head of its FSB security service, and on 14 entities marked a sharp departure from former President Donald Trump's reluctance to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biden stopped short, however, of putting sanctions on Putin himself.
Navalny, 44, fell ill on a flight in Siberia in August and was airlifted to Germany, where doctors concluded he had been poisoned with a nerve agent. The Kremlin has denied any role in his illness and said it had seen no proof he was poisoned.
Navalny was arrested in January on his return from Germany following treatment for poisoning with what many Western countries say was a military-grade nerve agent. He was jailed on Feb. 2 for parole violations on what he says were politically motivated charges, and sent to a penal colony on Monday.
""The intelligence community assesses with high confidence that officers of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) used a nerve agent to poison Russian opposition leader Alexi Navalny,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, discussing the steps.
Among those identified for sanctions by the U.S. Treasury Department were Alexander Bortnikov, director of the FSB; Andrei Yarin, chief of the Kremlin's domestic policy directorate; and deputy ministers of defense Alexei Krivoruchko and Pavel Popov.
The Treasury also included Sergei Kiriyenko, a former prime minister who is now Putin's first deputy chief of staff; Alexander Kalashnikov, director of the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service; and Prosecutor-General Igor Krasnov.
As a result, all assets of the seven under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen and U.S. persons are generally barred from dealing with them. In addition, any foreigner who knowingly ""facilitates a significant transaction"" for them risks being sanctioned.
It was unclear whether the seven had U.S. assets, making it hard to judge whether the sanctions were more than symbolic.
Psaki repeated a call for Navalny's release and defended the decision not to sanction Putin, saying this reflected a need ""to be able to maintain a relationship moving forward.""
Navalny, a critic of Putin, was targeted for raising questions about Russian corruption and was the latest example of Russian efforts to silence dissent, U.S. officials told reporters on a conference call.
""Russia’s attempt to kill Mr. Navalny follows an alarming pattern of chemical weapons use by Russia,"" a senior U.S. official said, referring to the March 2018 poisoning of former Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, England, with a military-grade nerve agent. Moscow denied poisoning Skripal and his daughter.
Although the Trump administration did impose sanctions on Russia after the Skripal poisoning, in general during his term Trump was deferential to Putin.
'ADVERSARIAL ELEMENTS'
In addition on Tuesday, 14 entities associated with Russia's biological and chemical agent production were hit with punitive measures, including nine commercial parties in Russia, three in Germany, one in Switzerland and a Russian government research institute.
The State Department also imposed sanctions https://www.state.gov/u-s-sanctions-and-other-measures-imposed-on-russia-in-response-to-russias-use-of-chemical-weapons via the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act, an executive order designed to combat weapons of mass destruction and the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.
Dan Fried, a former U.S. diplomat, praised the White House for acting fast, noting that Biden was sworn in six weeks ago.
""They did as much as they could quickly,"" said Fried, now with the Atlantic Council. ""I give them high marks.""
The United States acted in concert with the European Union, which imposed largely symbolic sanctions on four senior Russian officials close to Putin, a move agreed by EU ministers last week in response to Navalny's jailing.
The EU sanctions apply to Alexander Bastrykin, whose Investigative Committee handles major criminal probes and reports to Putin; Viktor Zolotov, head of Russia's National Guard; as well as to Krasnov and Kalashnikov.
The EU sanctions fall short of calls by Navalny's supporters to punish wealthy businessmen around Putin who travel to the EU.
Unlike Western sanctions imposed on Russia's economy in 2014 in response to its annexation of Crimea, travel bans and asset freezes have less impact, experts say, because state officials do not have funds in EU banks or travel to the EU.
Further sanctions are possible as the United States assesses the Russian role in the SolarWinds cyber hack and allegations that Russia sought to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election and offered bounties to Taliban fighters to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, U.S. officials said. Russia denies the allegations.
""We expect this relationship to remain a challenge,"" said a U.S. official, saying Washington would work with Moscow when it served U.S. interests. ""Given Russia’s conduct in recent months and years, there will also undoubtedly be adversarial elements.""

Before the U.S. announcement, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow would respond in kind to any new U.S. sanctions over Navalny, the Interfax news agency reported.

The court found that Sarkozy, 66, had tried to bribe a judge and peddle his influence after leaving office in exchange for inside information about an investigation into his 2007 campaign finances. Sarkozy is appealing the ruling.
Sarkozy on Tuesday protested his innocence. He said he was the victim of a deep injustice, that the ruling was riddled with inconsistencies and that the political impartiality of some investigating judges was open to question. 
""I appealed the decision, maybe I will have to pursue this fight all the way to the European Court of Human Rights,"" Sarkozy told Le Figaro newspaper. 
""That would be painful for me to have to get my own country condemned, but I'm ready to do so because that would be the price of democracy.""
Sarkozy, a conservative who led France from 2007 to 2012, was sentenced to three years in prison. However, two years were suspended and the presiding judge said she was open to him staying out of jail if tagged with an electronic bracelet for the remaining year. That decision lies with another judge.
He said he spent the evening after his conviction watching the U.S. drama series The Killing with his family.
Senior politicians from the opposition centre-right have rallied to Sarkozy's defence. Some allies previously hoped he might be drawn out of retirement to run in the 2022 presidential vote.
""Acquitted or not, it would change nothing politically,"" Sarkozy said. ""I had said I wouldn't be a candidate and I stand by that.""

Sarkozy stands trial in another case related to illegal campaign financing later this month.

(Reuters) - At least 13 people were killed on Tuesday when a maroon Ford Expedition crammed with 25 adults and children was slammed by a tractor-trailer near the U.S.-Mexico border, officials said.
It was not immediately clear how fast the vehicles were going, or whether the SUV had observed a stop sign before heading into an intersection along State Route 115 near El Centro, about 10 miles (16.1 km) north of the border, the California Highway Patrol (CHP) said. 
Those killed, who included the driver of the SUV, ranged in age from 20 to 55, and minors as young as 16 were injured, said Omar Watson, chief of the highway patrol's border division. 
Television images by an NBC affiliate showed the maroon SUV crunched next to a white truck cab with the name Haven and Sons written on the side.
Several of the occupants were ejected from the vehicle and died on the pavement; others died inside the SUV, Watson said.
Despite the presence of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents and Spanish translators, Watson did not address whether the SUV's occupants were migrant workers or others who might have crossed from Mexico in an overcrowded vehicle. Most of the survivors are Spanish-speaking, a CBP spokesperson said. 
Although the number varies by trim and model year, the Ford Expedition typically is designed to hold five to eight people. 
Watson said he CHP was working with the Mexican Consulate to determine who was in the vehicle and notify families of fatalities. 
The CBP spokesperson, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the case, said that the agency was not in pursuit of or aware of the vehicle until the Imperial County Sheriff's Department asked for its help at the crash site.
The agency does not know and is not investigating the immigration status of the people at this time. 
The driver of the tractor-trailer, which was hauling two loads of gravel, was also hospitalized with moderate injuries, Watson said. 
Several of the victims were taken to El Centro Regional Medical Center, the director of the hospital's emergency room, Judy Cruz, said in a news briefing posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Agriculture drives the economy around El Centro. Known as the Imperial Valley, the area is a big producer of fruits, vegetables, grain and cattle despite being desert due to irrigation from the Colorado River and a long growing season. 
Hospital officials had previously said that 27 people were in the SUV, and that 15 had died, but Watson said that there were 25 passengers and 13 fatalities.
Three patients were flown to other hospitals from the crash, and seven others were brought to El Centro. One person died at the hospital, Cruz said.

""The patients are going through a little bit of a difficult time as you can imagine,"" said Adolphe Edward, chief executive officer of El Centro Regional Medical Center.

PARIS (Reuters) - France and its Western allies plan to lodge a protest with the United Nations' nuclear watchdog to criticise Iran's decision to curb cooperation with the agency, the French foreign minister said on Tuesday.
Iran said last month it was scaling back cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, ending extra inspection and monitoring measures introduced by the 2015 nuclear deal, including the power given to the IAEA to carry out snap inspections at facilities not declared by Iran.
""The nuclear tensions will lead us in the coming days to put forward a protest in the framework of the IAEA Board of Governors to regret this decision,"" Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a parliamentary hearing.
Britain, France and Germany - all parties to the deal with Iran - on Monday circulated a draft resolution backed by the United States for the Vienna meeting voicing ""serious concern"" at Iran's reduced cooperation and urging Iran to reverse its steps.
Iran has bristled at the prospect of such criticism, threatening to cancel a deal struck a week ago with the IAEA to temporarily continue many of the monitoring measures it had decided to end - a black-box-type arrangement valid for up to three months and aimed at creating a window for diplomacy.
A vote on the resolution is due by the end of the week. 
The IAEA's 35-nation Board of Governors is holding a quarterly meeting this week against the backdrop of faltering efforts to revive Iran's nuclear deal with world powers now that U.S. President Joe Biden is in office.
Diplomacy, however, is making limited progress. Iran said on Sunday it would not take up a European Union proposal to hold a meeting with other parties to the deal and the United States.

""The situation is complicated,"" Le Drian said. ""The problem is to know who goes first and nobody wants to be trapped. The fact that the Iranians suspended the Additional Protocol is not good news,"" he said, referring to Iran's move last month to curb IAEA inspections.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued new public health requirements for U.S. visitors who have recently been in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or Guinea that take effect on Thursday to address Ebola concerns.
Travelers (NYSE:TRV) who have been in the two central African countries within the past 21 days must fly to one of six U.S. airports - New York-JFK, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington Dulles, Newark or Los Angeles, according to the order first announced on Monday but signed on Tuesday.
The CDC will require airlines to collect and transmit passenger information electronically to the agency for public health follow-up for all passengers who have been in the two countries who are boarding a flight to the United States.
""Timely public health follow-up requires health officials to have immediate access to accurate and complete contact information for travelers as they arrive in the United States,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.
Recently, less than 100 people a day have been arriving in the United States who have been in either country. The CDC said outbreaks are centered in remote areas of the countries and added that ""the risk of Ebola to the United States is extremely low.""
Three new cases of Ebola have been confirmed in eastern DRC, bringing to 11 the number of cases since authorities declared a resurgence of the deadly virus last month, a health official told reporters on Monday.
The cases represent a flare-up of the 2018-20 epidemic, which killed more than 2,200 people before it was declared over last June. Four people have died and two have recovered among the 11 cases. 

In January the Biden Administration, in a move to curb transmission of highly contagious new coronavirus variants, barred most non-U.S. citizens from the United States who have been in South Africa within the prior 14 days, extending restrictions in place for Brazil and most of Europe since 2020.

GUSAU, Nigeria (Reuters) - Gunmen who kidnapped nearly 300 schoolgirls from a boarding school in northwest Nigeria last week beat them and threatened to shoot them during a forced march into captivity, victims said on Tuesday after they were set free.
The pupils from Jangebe, a town in Zamfara state, were seized in a raid just after midnight on Friday. All 279 had now been released by the gunmen, Zamfara Governor Bello Matawalle said.
Dozens of girls in Muslim veils sat in a hall in a state government building before being taken for medical checks. A few parents arrived, and one father wept with joy after seeing his daughter. 
Farida Lawali, 15, told how she and the other girls had been taken to a forest by the kidnappers.
""They carried the sick ones that cannot move. We were walking in the stones and thorns,"" she said, covered in a light blue veil.
""They started hitting us with guns so that we could move,"" she added. ""While they were beating them with guns, some of them were crying and moving at the same time.""
Another of the girls, Umma Abubakar, told Reuters they were forced to walk although many had injuries: ""They said they will shoot anybody who did not continue to walk.""
Relief at their return was tempered by concern over the circumstances of their release. A series of similar school abductions in recent months has led many Nigerians to worry that regional authorities are making the situation worse by letting kidnappers go unpunished or paying them off.
Zailani Bappa, a media adviser to the state governor, denied that a ransom had been paid, but said the captors had been offered amnesty, as well as assistance to resettle at a site with newly built schools, a hospital and other facilities.
""The process means amnesty for those who repent and will be assisted to resettle,"" he said. ""Those who surrender their arms will be assisted to start a new life. Since they are herders, they will be supported with a few cows each.""
But the state's apparent conciliatory approach was at odds with the central government. President Muhammadu Buhari called for the captors to be brought to justice and said that if ransoms were being paid, this would make future attacks more likely.
His national security adviser, Babagana Monguno, said the president had ordered a massive military deployment to Zamfara, banned mining and imposed a no-fly zone in the state.
The central government ""will not allow this country to drift into state failure,"" Monguno said. ""We are not going to be blackmailed.""
But the military is already stretched, and it was difficult to assess whether the flight and mining bans would have much impact in a state with no major airport, and where many mines already operate illegally.
CRIMINAL GANGS
Boarding schools in northern Nigeria have become targets for mass kidnappings for ransom by armed criminal gangs.
The trend was started by the jihadist group Boko Haram, which kidnapped 270 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok in 2014, around 100 of whom have never been found. But recent months have seen a sudden escalation of similar attacks, including the abduction of 344 boys in December. 
Friday's raid on the Government Girls Science Secondary School was the second school abduction in little over a week. 
Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have told Reuters that the authorities have made payoffs in the past in exchange for child hostages, creating an incentive for abductions.
Several of those officials declined to comment on Tuesday on whether they believed a ransom had been paid in the latest incident.
Lawal Abdullahi, whose seven daughters were among those kidnapped and freed, said the incident would not deter him from schooling his children.

""It's a ploy to deny our girls ... from getting the Western education in which we are far behind,"" he told Reuters. ""We should not succumb to blackmail. My advice to government is that they should take immediate precautions to stop further abductions.""

""Having reminded (Rouhani) of the efforts made by France with its partners in the last years to reach a negotiated solution, the (French) head of state stressed it was important that Iran made clear and immediate gestures so that dialogue can resume with all parties to the Vienna deal,"" Macron's office said.
In 2019, Macron pushed to bring Washington and Tehran back to the negotiating table and to set parameters for wider future talks. Last month he offered himself as an ""honest broker."" https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2A42Q6
Expressing his deep concerns regarding Iran's decisions to violate the accord, Macron said it was vital Tehran returned into compliance and fully cooperate with the U.N. atomic watchdog. 
Iran has recently accelerated its violations of the 2015 deal in an apparent bid to raise pressure on U.S. President Joe Biden, as each side insists the other must move first.

Several Iranian media outlets said Rouhani had made it clear to Macron that the only way to revive the deal would be for the U.S. to lift sanctions and repeated that Tehran's decision to reduce its obligations was due to the U.S. withdrawal in 2018.

1283,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 02:40PM ET</span>","UK royal Meghan awarded $630,000 in costs after court privacy win","By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - Meghan, Britain's Duchess of Sussex, was awarded 450,000 pounds ($630,000) on Tuesday as a provisional payment towards her legal costs after she won a privacy claim against the Mail on Sunday which had printed extracts of a letter she wrote to her father.
Last month, a judge at London's High Court ruled the tabloid had breached her privacy and infringed her copyright by publishing parts of the five-page letter she wrote to her father, Thomas Markle, who she fell out with on the eve of her wedding to Queen Elizabeth's grandson, Prince Harry.
Judge Mark Warby ruled in her favour without holding a trial, saying the articles were a clear breach of privacy after the paper argued the duchess had intended the letter's contents to become public and it formed part of a media strategy.
At a hearing on Tuesday, Warby refused the paper permission to appeal that decision, saying he saw ""no real prospect"" that the Court of Appeal would reach a different conclusion. However, the paper is able to apply directly to the court.
The court was told Meghan's legal team was seeking more than 1.5 million pounds in legal fees, with half the amount to be paid within 14 days, a sum the paper described as ""disproportionate"". 
Warby agreed to make an interim costs order of 450,000 pounds, saying the final sum ""may well be considerably more than that"" after other outstanding issues were resolved at later hearings.
Meghan's legal team also demanded the paper hands over any copies it has of the letter, and called for the judge to order the paper to publish a statement on its front page stating she had won her case, with a notice also placed on the MailOnline's home page for ""not less than 6 months"" to act as a deterrent.
Warby said he would not make an order for the delivery or destruction of any copies of the letter yet.
Her lawyer Ian Mill told the hearing that they were not seeking to punish the paper, and would accept nominal damages based on the profits the Mail made from its articles, saying this was a ""proportionate"" way forward. 
In its written submissions, the paper's lawyers wrote: ""No purpose would be served by a hearing to determine the precise amount, which by definition is not relevant. It is suggested that 1 pound, 2 pounds or 5 pounds would do."" 
Meghan, 39, and husband Harry, 36, have regularly appeared on the front pages of Britain's newspapers in the last month, having announced they were expecting their second child, followed by news of their final split with the royal family following their decision to move to California last year.
On Sunday, a highly anticipated in-depth interview they have given to U.S. chat show queen Oprah Winfrey will be aired.

The previous government had resigned in January in a standoff with parliament that had posed the first big political challenge to the emir since he assumed power last September at a time the OPEC member state is facing a liquidity crunch.
Oil Minister Mohammad Abdulatif al-Fares, Finance Minister Khalifa Hamade and Foreign Minister Sheikh Ahmad Nasser al-Sabah were reappointed in the new Cabinet.
The previous government's resignation came after more than 30 members of parliament in the 50-seat assembly supported a motion to question Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Khalid al-Sabah on various issues, including his choice of ministers.
Since being reappointed on Jan. 24 as premier, a post Sheikh Sabah has held since late 2019, he has held consultations with parliamentary blocs.
""The coming period requires cooperation with the legislative authority and the meetings brought points of view closer together,"" KUNA quoted Sheikh Sabah as saying.
He stressed the need for agreeing a package of legislation, resolving ""some political files"" and uniting efforts to tackle ""financial and administrative corruption"" whether inside or outside the government apparatus, it added.
A key priority is overcoming legislative gridlock on debt legislation that would allow Kuwait to tap international markets to tackle the liquidity crunch caused by low oil prices and COVID-19. Lawmakers opposed to the bill have called for clarity on government plans to reduce reliance on oil exports.
Frequent rows and deadlocks between the appointed Cabinet and elected assembly have led to successive government reshuffles and dissolutions of parliament over decades, hampering investment and economic and fiscal reform.
Emir Sheikh Nawaf, who has final say in state matters, last month issued a decree suspending parliament's sessions for one month as of Feb. 18.
Kuwait has the most vibrant political system among Gulf Arab states, with a parliament able to pass, and block, legislation and question ministers. Senior government posts are occupied by members of Kuwait's ruling family. 

Kuwaiti opposition figures made gains in last year's parliamentary polls. Some have proposed electoral reforms and a pardon for dissidents, many in self-exile, to the new emir.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 02:20PM ET</span>",Resurgent stock market evokes memories of long-gone bubble on Tokyo's 'Wall Street',"By Junko Fujita
TOKYO (Reuters) - At the almost empty ""Wall Street"" bar and restaurant in Tokyo's Kayabacho financial district, three groups of patrons dine quietly at tables separated by partitions.
The sedate scene is a far cry from the area's heyday 30 years ago when traders flush from big wins on the nearby Tokyo Stock Exchange routinely crowded the restaurant's bar, downing glasses of premium whiskey. 
Even though Japanese stocks are scaling giddy heights not seen since the asset inflation bubble of the late 1980s and early 1990s, bars and restaurants in the financial district aren't along for the ride. 
Kayabacho's streets are instead eerily quiet. 
""During the bubble era, people came here to drink a glass of Ballantine's 30-year-old (whisky) for 5,500 yen ($52), even when there's no seats available, just standing by the cash register,"" ""Wall Street"" owner Kenichi Inoue, 62, told Reuters.
Inoue opened the European style bar and restaurant in 1989, the year the Nikkei index hit a record peak, aiming to serve drinks and food at the affordable price of around $30 per person. 
Brokers and traders packed into the bar almost every evening, with tables at the back usually filled by workers from Yamaichi Securities, then the country's fourth largest brokerage. 
""It was easy to guess the size of the crowd for the evening,"" said Inoue. ""If the market was up, I knew it would be busy.""
Inoue's restaurant wasn't the only establishment to benefit during the boom. Coffee shops scattered throughout Kayabacho were filled with brokers exchanging information on the market.
The 'Tatsumi' restaurant was popular with superstitious traders because it served tempura, or deep fried vegetables and fish. The Japanese word for ""deep-fry"", ageru, has the same sound as the word ""boost"". 
""Back then brokers used to come here in a group. They gave us 100,000 yen in cash in an advance,"" said 62-year-old owner, Masahiko Tsuda, citing a figure equivalent to around $800 at the time. ""If that was not enough, they paid the difference at the end of the week."" 
The party came to an end when the stocks bubble burst in the early 1990s. Yamaichi was one of four major banks and brokerages that collapsed in 1997.
Compounding the market slide, the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1999 completed a decade-long switch to electronic trading, closing the formerly bustling trading floor.
The number of brokerage employees almost halved from a peak of 170,000 nationwide in 1991 to 91,000 last year, according to the Japan Securities Dealers Association.
With them went much of the vibrancy of Kayabacho, a downturn that has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to trading restrictions on bars and restaurants across Tokyo.
REDEVELOPMENT PLANS
Redevelopment plans for Kayabacho, which houses many small and old buildings, have been in train for several years, with attempts to rebrand the area as a fintech hub. Heiwa Real Estate, the owner of the stock exchange building, plans to open a 15-storey office tower in the area later this year. 
But the revamp lags the refurbishment of neighbouring districts like Marunouchi and Nihonbashi, where major property developers Mitsubishi Estate (OTC:MITEY) and Mitsui Fudosan (OTC:MTSFY) have created hubs for global firms.
Adding to Kayabacho's woes, the coronavirus pandemic has dealt a blow to the real estate market across Tokyo, as more people work from home and domestic economic growth slows.
""Kayabacho's atmosphere is dark and gloomy,"" said Yoko Hattori, 52, the owner of a standing bar, New Kayaba. ""The economy is bad. Many buildings here are old but renovation is not easy because it costs money.""
Tsuda said he no longer sees people flashing lots of cash at his restaurant, while Inoue said ""Wall Street"" was facing the most critical time of its history. 
Inoue has attempted to diversify his menu from the pasta, pizza and grilled meats that catered to mostly male stockbrokers, adding organic food and cold press juice for more health-conscious customers. 

He is grateful that his own business never relied too heavily on the excesses of the bubble era: ""If this had been an high-end restaurant, it would have been closed a long time ago.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - China said on Tuesday that it was discussing a visit to its Xinjiang region by United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, but that she should not set out with the aim of condemning its policies.
Bachelet said on Friday that reports about arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, sexual violence and forced labour in Xinjiang necessitated a thorough and independent assessment of the situation.
""The door to Xinjiang is always open, and we welcome the High Commissioner to visit Xinjiang. Communication is kept up between the two sides, but the aim of the visit is to provide exchanges and cooperation rather than ... so-called investigation based on 'guilty before proven',"" China's delegate Jiang Duan told the U.N. Human Rights Council.
China opposed the ""politicisation"" of human rights and interference in its internal affairs, he said, also rejecting concerns raised by Australia, Sweden and the United States at the Geneva forum.
""We also find it regrettable the High Commissioner made unsubstantiated accusations against China based on misinformation and political pressure,"" said Jiang.
People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the Tibetan region enjoy wide-ranging freedoms, including religious and cultural harmony, he said.
Bachelet said on Friday that she hoped to clinch agreement with Chinese officials about a visit. Louise Arbour was the last U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit China, in September 2005.
Activists remain sceptical about the prospects for a meaningful visit with unfettered access in China.
Sophie Richardson, China director for Human Rights Watch, said in a tweet on Tuesday: ""Of course #China statement that ""the aim of the #Xinjiang visit is to provide exchanges and cooperation"" says it all, doesn't it? That 'door' is firmly closed.""

Sarah Brooks of the International Service for Human Rights said: ""After more than two years of spinning their wheels on a visit, the High Commissioner and her team, and the governments at the Human Rights Council, need to shift gears to take decisive action"".

1287,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 01:47PM ET</span>","Myanmar's neighbours press junta for Suu Kyi's release, restoration of democracy","(Reuters) - Some of Myanmar's neighbours pressed its ruling junta on Tuesday to release ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi and cease using lethal force against opponents of their Feb. 1 coup to work out a solution to the crisis.
The calls from fellow members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) came as Myanmar police again opened fire to disperse crowds after weeks of demonstrations against military rule. Several people were wounded, witnesses said.
ASEAN foreign ministers held talks with a representative of the junta in a video call two days after the bloodiest day of unrest since the military overthrew Suu Kyi's elected government.
At least 21 people have been killed since the coup, which Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in an interview with the BBC was a ""tragic"" step back for Myanmar.
The foreign minister of Indonesia, which has been pushing a regional diplomatic effort, urged Myanmar to ""open its doors"" to the ASEAN bloc to resolve the escalating tension, but said there was little it could do if it did not.
Retno Marsudi, called for the release of political detainees and for the restoration of democracy, while pledging that ASEAN countries would not break their pledge of not interfering in each other's affairs.
""Restoring democracy back on track must be pursued,"" Retno said. ""Indonesia underlines that the will, the interest and the voices of the people of Myanmar must be respected.""
The foreign ministers of Malaysia and the Philippines also called for the release of Suu Kyi.
But some countries were less emphatic and a statement from the group said ""all parties"" should refrain from instigating violence and that ASEAN stood ready to help.
ASEAN groups Myanmar, Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam.
The bloc's effort to engage with Myanmar's military has been criticised by supporters of democracy, with a committee of ousted Myanmar lawmakers declaring the junta a terrorist group and saying ASEAN's engagement would give it legitimacy. 
Sa Sa, a senior member of the committee who has been anointed as its representative to the United Nations, said ASEAN should have no dealings with ""this illegitimate military-led regime"".
Myanmar's own representative to the United Nations denounced the coup last week and after the junta announced he had been fired, he staked a formal claim as the legitimate representative, according to letters seen by Reuters.
CONDEMNATION
The coup halted Myanmar's tentative steps towards democracy after nearly 50 years of military rule and has drawn condemnation and sanctions from the United States and other Western countries.
Singapore's Lee said sanctions would not affect the junta but hurt the people and the way forward was to free Suu Kyi and work out a solution - describing the takeover as ""an enormous tragic step back"".
""To use lethal force against civilians and unarmed demonstrators, I think it is just not acceptable. That is disastrous not just internationally, but disastrous domestically,"" said. 
Hundreds of protesters, many wearing hard hats and clutching makeshift shields, gathered earlier behind barricades in different parts of Myanmar's main city of Yangon to chant slogans before police moved in firing stun grenades.
There were no reports of injuries in Yangon but four people were wounded in the northwestern town of Kale, where police fired live ammunition to disperse a crowd after protesters threw objects at advancing police, witnesses said.
State television MRTV later said security forces used stun grenades, rubber bullets and other non-lethal measures.
""They were acting like they were in a war zone,"" a teacher at the protest who declined to be identified said of the police.
MRTV said that crowds were being instigated through social media by illegal organisations and causing instability. It said 12 ""riotous protesters"" had been detained in Yangon.
After the use of force by security forces on the streets, people protested from their balconies after dark across Yangon, chanting ""the revolution must succeed"" and calls for Suu Kyi's health.
The military justified the coup saying its complaints of fraud in a November election won by Suu Kyi's party were ignored. The election commission said the vote was fair.
Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing has pledged to hold new elections and hand power to the winner but has given no time frame.
Suu Kyi, 75, appeared at a court hearing via video conferencing on Monday and looked in good health, one of her lawyers said. Two more charges were added to those filed against her after the coup, the lawyer said.

More than 1,100 people have been detained, according to activists, among them six journalists in Yangon, one of whom works for the Associated Press, which has called for his release.

1288,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 01:41PM ET</span>","No evidence U.S. Capitol rioters belong to antifa movement, FBI chief Wray testifies","By Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director Chris Wray on Tuesday debunked conspiracy theories promoted by right-wing supporters of former President Donald Trump, saying there was no evidence that leftist extremists disguised themselves as Trump supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol.
In testimony to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Wray also told lawmakers that the Federal Bureau of Investigation views the actions of the rioters on Jan. 6 as ""domestic terrorism,"" and vowed to hold them accountable.
""We have not to date seen any evidence of any anarchist violent extremists or people subscribing to antifa in connection with the 6th,"" he testified, referring to the loosely organized anti-fascist movement.
""That doesn't mean we're not looking and we'll continue to look, but at the moment, we have not seen that.""
Tuesday was Wray's first testimony in Congress since the attack, a failed bid to block Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's November election victory. The attack occurred immediately after Republican Trump, in a speech near the White House, exhorted his supporters to march to the Capitol, having repeated his false claims that the election was stolen from him.
The Justice Department has charged more than 300 people with crimes ranging from conspiracy to attacking police and obstructing Congress. The rioting left five dead.
At least 18 people associated with the far-right Proud Boys have been charged and nine people tied to the anti-government militia known as the Oath Keepers are facing charges they conspired as far back as November to storm the Capitol to prevent Biden from becoming president. 
Biden took office on Jan. 20.
Wray revealed that since the attacks, the FBI has also seen instances of ""foreign adversaries"" who have been ""leveraging the events of Jan. 6 to amplify their own narratives"" and push propaganda. 
He did not provide further details, saying he could not do so in an unclassified setting.
Supporters of Trump have repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims the rioters were actually fake Trump supporters who belong to antifa. They have also repeated Trump's false claims that the election was stolen due to widespread fraud.
Wray told lawmakers on Tuesday this narrative was false.
To the contrary, he said, a number of the rioters belong to far-right militia movements, or were motivated by racial ideologies - but none to date appear to belong to any left-wing groups. 
The anti-government militia extremists, he noted, appears to be the ""biggest bucket"" that is trending as the FBI examines the backgrounds of the rioters.
Wray said he stood by comments made by former Attorney General Bill Barr, who had infuriated Trump after the election when he said the Justice Department did not have evidence of any widespread election fraud.
""We are not aware of any widespread evidence of voter fraud, much less that would have affected the outcome of the presidential election,"" Wray told lawmakers.
The FBI has yet to arrest any suspects in the death of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, or for pipe bombs that were discovered outside the headquarters of both the Republican and Democratic national committees.
The FBI has obtained a video that shows a suspect spraying bear spray on police officers, including Sicknick, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation.
The suspect has yet to be identified by name, and it is still unclear if the bear spray contributed to Sicknick's death.
Wray said he cannot disclose a cause of death, and Sicknick's death is still under investigation.
In a newly unsealed search warrant, investigators say rioters carried weapons inside the Capitol including tire irons, sledge hammers, tasers, bear spray and, in at least one case, a handgun with an extended magazine.
Investigators including the FBI have come under scrutiny over why more was not done to protect the Capitol ahead of the attack.
The day before, the FBI's Norfolk, Virginia, office distributed a raw, unverified intelligence report which warned that violent extremists intended to disrupt Congress.
Wray told lawmakers the intelligence was shared with other law enforcement agencies three different ways, but acknowledged he personally did not see the report until a few days later.
As to why other top law enforcement officials did not see it, Wray said: ""I don't have a good answer to that.""

Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said to Wray: ""What I don't understand is why this ... raw intelligence didn't prompt a stronger warning and alarm.""

Biden made an election campaign pledge to spend $4 billion to help address the root causes of migration from Central America, after large numbers have fled poverty and violence in the region, many seeking asylum in the United States.
""President Biden has proposed dedicating $4 billion for the development of the nations of Central America and in the south of our country,"" Lopez Obrador told a news conference, referring to a virtual meeting with Biden the day before. 
He did not specify how Mexico might benefit from the funds, but said he spoke to Biden about the importance of economic development and mentioned two major infrastructure schemes - a rail project across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the ""Mayan Train"" linking tourist towns around the Yucatan Peninsula.

Both are designed to help lift the economy of southern Mexico, which has lagged behind other parts of the country.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Six children's books written by Dr. Seuss will no longer be published because they contain racist and insensitive imagery, the company set up to preserve the author's legacy said on Tuesday. 
The books - ""And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,"" ""If I Ran the Zoo,"" ""McElligot's Pool (NASDAQ:POOL),"" ""On Beyond Zebra!"" ""Scrambled Eggs Super!"" and ""The Cat's Quizzer"" - are among more than 60 books written by Dr. Seuss, the pen name of Theodor Geisel, who died in 1991.
""These books portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong,"" Dr. Seuss Enterprises said in a statement.
The books, originally published between 1937 and 1976, contain numerous caricatures of Asian and Black people that incorporate stereotypes that have been criticized as racist. 
Publishers of the books included Random House and Vanguard Press. 
Dr. Seuss Enterprises said it worked with a panel of experts, including educators, to review its catalog and made the decision last year to end publication and licensing.
It chose to make the announcement on March 2, the anniversary of Geisel's birth in 1904. In 1998, the National Education Association designated his birthday as ""Read Across America Day,"" an annual event aimed at encouraging children and teens to read.
His most famous books - ""The Cat in the Hat"" and ""Green Eggs and Ham"" - were not on the list of books that will be yanked from publication.
""Oh, the Places You'll Go!"" often tops the New York Times bestseller list during graduation season, and also was not on the list of scrapped books.
Dr. Seuss Enterprises said the move was a first step in its efforts to promote inclusion for all children.

""Ceasing sales of these books is only part of our commitment and our broader plan to ensure Dr. Seuss Enterprises' catalog represents and supports all communities and families,"" the company said.

""The possibility is not closed,"" Lopez Obrador told a news conference a day after a virtual meeting between the two leaders, referring to his request for the United States to help fill some of the gap in Mexico's vaccine supply. 
""But it's subject to the decision to be taken by teams both in Mexico and the United States. They will decide if it's possible, and when,"" he added.
Prior to the meeting, the White House had said its priority was to inoculate all Americans.
Biden said last month that he was confident he could surpass his goal to administer 100 million COVID-19 shots during his first 100 days in office - a deadline of late April. 
Lopez Obrador added that he and Biden had no disagreements over the matter, and that the two exchanged invitations to visit their respective countries. 
The leftist leader also said he expressed support for Biden's plans for migration reform that could legalize the residency status of migrants living without documentation in the United States. 
""They see him as the migrant's president,"" he said. 
The two did not discuss Mexico's controversial electricity reform, although Lopez Obrador said he emphasized the energy sector as a priority.

A bill aimed at increasing state control of the electricity market has angered private businesses and could cause disputes with top trade partners.

""Help, help. They're shooting at me,"" Kaung Myat Hlaing, a reporter for the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), can be heard shouting in the video taken in the southern coastal town of Myeik.
The video is shot from a first-floor balcony, where clothes are drying on a line, as police shine a light from the street below and shout at him to come down. There is the sound of someone apparently pulling at the front door and then a puff of smoke appears on the balcony, accompanied by what sounds like gunfire.
The DVB news agency confirmed the detention of Kaung Myat Hlaing in a statement and called for his release, as well as the release of other detained journalists.
An officer who answered the telephone at the Myeik Township Police Station said news of the reporter's detention had not been confirmed and hung up.
Six journalists have been arrested at protests in the main city of Yangon over recent days.
They have all been charged under a penal code section making it a crime to publish material that could cause a soldier or other service member ""to mutiny or otherwise disregard or fail in his duty"", Tin Zar Oo, a lawyer for an Associated Press journalist among the six, said on Tuesday.
The Associated Press called on Monday for the immediate release of journalist Thein Zaw.
The military overthrew the elected government on Feb. 1, detaining its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and others and unleashing street protests across the country.
The spokesman for the junta has not addressed the issue of the arrest of journalists in the protests and has not responded to telephone calls from Reuters seeking comment.
Many people have taken to live-streaming the protests and, increasingly, police efforts to disperse them.
The DVB said about half a dozen military and police cars surrounded its reporter's street at about 10.30 p.m. on Monday, after protests in the town earlier in the day.
The DVB said it did not know what kind of guns or rounds were fired but it believed police were threatening the reporter, but not firing at him.
The coup halted Myanmar's tentative steps towards democracy after nearly 50 years of military rule, and has drawn condemnation and sanctions from the United States and other Western countries, and growing concern among its neighbours.

The United States warned Myanmar's military on Monday that it would take more action if security forces kill unarmed people and attack journalists and activists, which State Department spokesman Ned Price called ""abhorrent violence"".

1293,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 11:51AM ET</span>","EU, under pressure over vaccine rollouts, considers switch to emergency approvals","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Tuesday that it was considering emergency approvals for COVID-19 vaccines as a faster alternative to more rigorous conditional marketing authorisations which have been used so far.
The move would mark a big shift in approach to vaccine approvals, as it would entail using a procedure that the EU had considered dangerous and that before the COVID-19 pandemic had been reserved for exceptional authorisation at national level of drugs for terminally ill patients, including cancer treatments.
The potential change comes as the EU executive and the bloc's drug regulator come under increasing pressure for what some consider slow vaccine approvals, which have contributed to a slower rollout of COVID-19 shots in the 27-nation union, compared to the United States and former EU member Britain.
""We are ready to reflect with the member states on all possible avenues to indeed accelerate the approval of the vaccines,"" an EU Commission spokesman told a news conference after the matter was discussed earlier on Tuesday at a COVID-19 meeting with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
One option could be ""an emergency authorisation of vaccines at EU level with shared liability among member states"", the spokesman said, adding that work on this could start very quickly if EU governments supported the idea.
It was not clear whether an EU-wide emergency authorisation procedure, if agreed upon, would entail the same conditions as emergency approvals granted at national level, the commission spokesman told Reuters.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) cannot currently issue emergency approvals but in exceptional circumstances has recommended the compassionate use of drugs before marketing authorisation.
This procedure was used in April to initially authorise doctors to use Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD)'s antiviral drug remdesivir as a treatment against COVID-19. The drug was later given conditional approval by EMA.
CHANGE OF TACK
National emergency approvals are allowed under EU laws, but they force countries to take full responsibility if something goes wrong with a vaccine, whereas under the more rigorous marketing authorisation, pharmaceutical companies remain liable for their vaccines.
The EU Commission had said that national emergency authorisations should not be used for COVID-19 vaccines because faster approvals could reduce regulators' ability to check efficacy and safety data.
This could also boost vaccine hesitancy, which is already high in some countries, EU officials had said.
One senior EU official said the emergency procedure had so far usually been used at national level for terminally ill patients and the EU had instead chosen the lengthier conditional marketing authorisation because with vaccines ""we inject healthy people"" and the risk was disproportionate.
The change of tack would come after Eastern European countries, including Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, approved or said they were considering approval of Russian and Chinese vaccines with national emergency procedures.
Britain has also used the emergency procedure to approve COVID-19 vaccines.

The EU Commission also said last month it was working on a possible fast-track approval of upgraded anti-variant vaccines, which had already been authorised and would need fewer comprehensive checks before they are made available to the public.

JALALABAD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Three female media workers were shot dead in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad on Tuesday, government officials said, amid a wave of killings that is spreading fear among professional workers in urban centres.
Zalmai Latifi, head of local broadcaster Enikas TV, said the three women were recent high school graduates aged between 18 and 20 who worked in the station's dubbing department.
Government sources said the women were killed on their way home from work and witnesses said gunmen shot the women in the head before fleeing. A fourth woman was injured and a hospital spokesman said she had been admitted to hospital and was fighting for her life.
Provincial police chief Juma Gul Hemat said that the suspected lead attacker had been arrested and that he was connected to the insurgent Taliban. A Taliban spokesman denied the group had any involvement in the attack.
A wave of shootings and small bombs attached to vehicles in have targeted journalists, civil society workers and mid-level government employees in recent months.
The Afghan government and some foreign powers have blamed the attacks largely on the Taliban, which denies involvement. The Islamic State group also has a presence in the eastern Afghan province of Nangahar, of which Jalalabad is the capital.
""The targeted killing of journalists could cause a state of fear in the journalistic community, and this could lead to self-censorship, abandonment of media activities, and even leaving the country,"" said Mujib Khalwatgar, head of Afghan media advocacy group Nai. 
Enikas TV's Latifi said the channel, which was set up in 2018, had employed 10 women but four had now been killed, including Malala Maiwand, a television journalist shot alongside her driver late last year.
The Taliban and Afghan government are carrying out peace talks in Doha, though progress has slowed while U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, is reviewing its plans for the peace process and the withdrawal of troops.

""These attacks are meant to intimidate; they are intended to make reporters cower; the culprits hope to stifle freedom of speech in a nation where the media has flourished during the past 20 years. This cannot be tolerated,"" the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said in a statement on Twitter.

The list used internally at Pontins and obtained by the i newspaper included surnames commonly found in Ireland and within the Irish diaspora in Britain, such as Doherty, Gallagher, Murphy, Nolan, O'Brien and O'Connell.
The list was aimed at stopping Gypsies and Irish Travellers from staying at Pontins facilities, according to a whistleblower who contacted the Equality and Human Rights Commission.
""It is hard not to draw comparisons with an ‘undesirable guests’ list and the signs displayed in hotel windows 50 years ago, explicitly barring Irish people and Black people,"" said Alastair Pringle, the commission's executive director.
""Banning people from services based on their race is discrimination and is unlawful. To say that such policies are outdated is an understatement.""
The whistleblower told the i that while working in the booking department at Pontins, which runs six holiday parks in England and Wales, he was instructed to refuse or cancel bookings requested by customers whose names were on the list.
Britannia Jinky Jersey Limited, the company that owns Pontins, signed a legally binding agreement with the commission in which it pledged to prevent discriminatory practices.
""Britannia Jinky Jersey Limited has agreed to work together with the Equality and Human Rights Commission to further enhance its staff training and procedures in order to further promote equality throughout its business,"" a spokesman said in a statement posted by the Commission.
The company could not immediately be reached by Reuters for further comment or explanation of the policy.
Irish higher education minister Simon Harris, one of many who reacted to the case in Ireland, said he was saddened and angered.
""As a child, my family and I holidayed in Pontins many times. Childhood memories of a happy place and good times are now replaced by a sense of disgust that such prejudice would exist,"" he said on Twitter. 

A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the list as ""completely unacceptable"".

BEIJING/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - China on Tuesday rejected an allegation by a cyber intelligence firm that a state-backed hacking group targeted the IT systems of two Indian coronavirus vaccine makers.
Cyfirma told Reuters that hacking group APT10, known as Stone Panda, had identified gaps and vulnerabilities in the IT infrastructure and supply chain software of Bharat Biotech and the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker.
""Without showing any evidence, the relevant party made baseless speculation, distorted and concocted facts, to malign a specific party,"" China's foreign ministry told Reuters.
""This behaviour is irresponsible and has ulterior motive. China firmly opposes it,"" it added in a written reply to questions about Cyfirma's allegations.
Asked to respond to Beijing's comment, Cyfirma, a company which is backed by investors including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), said in a statement: ""We stand by our findings and research"".
SII declined to comment. Bharat Biotech, which said on Monday it did not comment on hacking-related matters, had no immediate comment on Tuesday.
The office of the director-general of the state-run Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) told Reuters on Monday the hacking matter had been handed to its operations director.
It declined further comment.
SII is making the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine for many countries and will soon start bulk manufacturing  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) shots, while Bharat Biotech plans to export its COVAXIN shot to dozens of countries including Brazil and the Philippines.
China and India have both sold or gifted COVID-19 shots to many countries. India produces more than 60% of all vaccines sold in the world.
Relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours soured in June when 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed in a Himalayan border confrontation. Recent talks have eased tension, and the Chinese foreign ministry said both sides were working towards safeguarding the peace in the border region.
""China and India are using military diplomatic channel to communicate about how to properly manage the border situation,"" the foreign ministry statement said.

""We hope everyone can work together to stop the spreading of fake information,"" it added.

1297,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 10:40AM ET</span>",Dutch postpone Qatar trade mission over World Cup worker concerns,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch government has postponed a trade mission to Qatar this month, citing concern over the living conditions of migrant workers helping the Gulf state to prepare for next year's soccer World Cup.
Britain's Guardian newspaper last week reported that its calculations showed that at least 6,500 migrant workers had died in Qatar since it won the right to stage the 2022 World Cup 10 years ago.
Many of them worked on World Cup projects, a labour rights advocacy group told the paper. 
""This report has led to a broad discussion in Dutch society and in parliament,"" Dutch foreign ministry spokesman Jeroen van Dommelen said.
""We have talked before with Qatar about the poor conditions for these workers, but these numbers give the discussion a new meaning. We want to hear Qatar's response before we can think of a new date for the mission.""
In response to the Guardian report, Qatar said the reported deaths were ""within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population"" of the workers concerned.
The mortality rate had consistently declined since 2010 due to health and safety reforms, the government said.
The trade mission, which was to be held as a video conference due to coronavirus related travel restrictions, had been scheduled for March 22 to April 1.
Qatar had not responded yet to the Dutch government's decision, Van Dommelen said.
A majority of parties in the Dutch parliament last week called on the government and King Willem-Alexander to stay away from the World Cup next year in protest against the treatment of migrant workers.
The human rights group Amnesty International has repeatedly said the tournament organiser's worker welfare standards are inadequate to prevent abuses and provide timely remedies. It has also accused soccer's governing body, FIFA, of failing to take seriously alleged human rights abuses linked to the event.
Qatar announced changes to its labour laws last August, raising the minimum wage by 25% to 1,000 riyals ($275) a month and scrapping a requirement for workers to obtain permission from their employers to change jobs.

The Guardian said the true death toll among migrant workers in Qatar was likely to be much higher than 6,500, because this figure was based on data only from India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka and excluded other countries that send large numbers of workers to Qatar.

KEREM SHALOM, Israel (Reuters) - Israel estimates that hundreds of its citizens might be subject to war crimes probes by the International Criminal Court, whose jurisdiction it rejects, and is working on how to protect them, the Defence Minister said on Tuesday.
Including himself among Israelis who could be threatened with arrest, Benny Gantz told Reuters: ""I was never afraid to go across enemy lines, I will continue to stand wherever I have to."" 
The Hague-based tribunal ruled last month that it has jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. The ruling could lead to criminal investigations of Israel and of Palestinian militant groups including Hamas.
Israel is not a member of the court and rejects its jurisdiction, a position backed by its close ally the United States. Palestinians have welcomed the ruling as a chance for justice for victims of Israeli attacks.
In an interview on Israel's fortified border with Gaza, Gantz, who also holds Israel's justice portfolio, called the ruling a ""negative development"" and added: ""We have our own teams working in different (places) to try (and) influence (the ICC).""
Gantz was the military's chief of staff during a 2014 war between Israel and militants in Hamas-controlled Gaza. The ICC has pointed to that conflict as a potential issue to be probed. 
Asked by Reuters how many Israelis, including himself, might expect to be subject to arrest should the probe lead to criminal investigations, Gantz said: ""I guess several hundred, but we will take care of everybody.""
Gantz called that ""an estimate"", declining to say if Israel had drawn up a list of officials. Israel will provide legal assistance to any implicated Israelis and will give them legal warnings regarding travel if necessary, Gantz said. 

Asked if he himself might change his travel plans in light of the ICC probe, Gantz said: ""So far, no.""

ANKARA (Reuters) - With its support in polls dropping, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party is considering changes to electoral laws which could rescue its prospects in elections due to be held by 2023, three AK Party officials say.
Polls show combined support for the AK Party and its MHP ally has fallen to just 45%. For the first time, pollsters say, disenchanted supporters who drifted away from the AK Party appear unlikely to be won back.
Modern Turkey's longest-ruling leader and the most powerful since its founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Erdogan has lost support after economic growth slowed, the lira nose-dived and two AK Party founders broke away to form rival parties.
He remains the country's pre-eminent politician, with wide powers under an executive presidency introduced three years ago, but still relies on parliament for legislative endorsement.
Support for his Islamist-rooted AK Party, in power since 2002, has fallen to 36% from 42% at the last election, with its nationalist MHP ally slipping to 8%, according to a compilation of 15 recent polls.
Defeat in Turkey's three largest cities in 2019 municipal elections highlight the challenge for the next national vote. Options for new party alliances are limited after Erdogan's virulent denunciation of opposition parties.
Trying to seize back the initiative, he announced a government plan for human rights on Tuesday and eased nationwide coronavirus lockdowns. He also promised changes to election rules, without giving details.
""We are starting extensive work regarding changing political party and election regulations to improve democratic participation,"" the president said.
Three AK Party sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said plans included dividing large urban electoral districts into smaller constituencies, changes which one party official said could significantly boost the number of AK Party lawmakers.
They could also cut the threshhold for entering parliament - currently at 10% of votes, one of the highest in the world - to 7%, a move that would reassure Erdogan's nationalist partners after their support fell below the existing threshold.
A 7% barrier would still be high enough to bar the breakaway Gelecek (Future) and DEVA parties, both polling around 2%, from entering parliament unless they were part of a larger alliance.
AKP 'WORN OUT'
Pollsters say Erdogan's military interventions and assertive foreign policy, which dragged Turkey into political crises with the United States and European Union, had cost support in addition to the domestic difficulties.
""The AK Party and Tayyip Erdogan wore themselves out, in particular due to economic policies which they applied and in particular their foreign policies,"" MetroPOLL research director Özer Sencar. 
Sencar and MAK Consultancy Chairman Mehmet Ali Kulat said a growing number of people were turning their backs on Erdogan's party, without knowing yet in which direction they might turn.
""For the first time, there is a grey area that says they are mad at the AK Party and will not vote for it,"" said Kulat. ""In the past, they would get mad but they would still vote for it.""
Kulat said the two new parties, as well as the centrist nationalist Iyi Party, had already peeled some voters away from the AK Party.
The AK Party officials who spoke to Reuters acknowledged the party has been losing support but said that was partly down to the temporary impact of coronavirus restrictions, including three months of nightly curfews and weekend lockdowns across Turkey.

""There is a mass of voters who are straying from the party but there will be more work in the field to win these back,"" one source said.

President Tayyip Erdogan's government and its nationalist MHP allies accuse the HDP of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), accusations that escalated after Ankara said Turkish captives were killed by the PKK in Iraq last month.
The MHP have repeatedly called for the HDP's closure over links to the PKK, which Turkey, the European Union, and United States designate a terrorist organisation. 
The HDP denies the accusation. The third largest party in parliament, it has also faced a barrage of legal bids to lift the parliamentary immunity of its lawmakers.
""God willing, we will shut down the HDP in the eyes of the people,"" Cahit Ozkan, a deputy parliamentary group chairman for Erdogan's AKP, was quoted as saying by the state-owned Anadolu news agency. 
""Our people have lost hope in this party. All 83 million are demanding that this party be politically shut at the ballots and legally within the framework of the constitutional order."" 
Ozkan's remarks come after Erdogan, whose government has faced criticism from rights groups and Western allies over backsliding in democratic freedoms, announced plans to strengthen the right to fair trial and freedoms of expression.
Earlier on Tuesday, MHP leader Devlet Bahceli reiterated his call to shut the HDP and called for measures to prevent it re-establishing under a different name, as it has done before. 
""The HDP's closure is urgent, vital and mandatory,"" Bahceli said. ""From head to toe, the HDP is in the swamp of corruption and terror"".
The crackdown on the HDP has included arrests of thousands of party officials and members, while dozens of its elected mayors and lawmakers have been ousted.

The PKK has waged an insurgency in the mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey since 1984 and more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday announced sanctions on senior Russian government officials and Russian entities in response to what U.S. officials said was Moscow's attempt to kill opposition leader Alexei Navalny with a nerve agent.
The announcement, made by senior Biden administration officials, marked a sharp turn away from former President Donald Trump's reluctance to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Navalny fell ill on a flight in Siberia in August and was airlifted to Germany, where doctors concluded he had been poisoned with a nerve agent. The Kremlin has denied any role in his illness and said it had seen no proof he was poisoned.
The officials said Navalny was targeted for his activism in trying to raise questions about what they called Russian corruption.
""Russia’s attempt to kill Mr. Navalny follows an alarming pattern of chemical weapons use by Russia,"" a senior Biden administration official told reporters on a call. 
The officials said seven senior Russian government officials would face sanctions, such as asset freezes. In addition 14 entities associated with Russia's biological and chemical agent production, including 13 commercial parties and a government research institute, were levied punitive measures.
The U.S. moves were being taken in coordination with the European Union. The officials reiterated Biden's call for Russia to release Navalny from prison.
Biden has taken a tougher approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin than Trump.
“The United States is neither seeking to reset our relations with Russia, nor are we seeking to escalate,"" one official said.
""We believe that the United States and our partners must be clear and impose costs when Russia’s behavior crosses boundaries that are respected by responsible nations, and we believe there should be guard rails on how these adversarial aspects of our relationship play out,"" the official said.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday before the U.S. announcement that Moscow would respond in kind to any new U.S. sanctions over Navalny, the Interfax news agency reported.
After his medical treatment in Germany, Navalny, 44, returned to Russia in January. He was arrested and later sentenced to more than 2-1/2 years in jail for parole violations he said were trumped up.

Further sanctions are upcoming, as the United States assesses the Russian role in the massive SolarWinds cyber hack and allegations that Russia sought to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election and offered bounties to Taliban fighters to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, the officials said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Myanmar's ambassador to the United Nations in New York formally staked his claim as the country's legitimate representative in letters - seen by Reuters on Tuesday - to the U.N. General Assembly president and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
Myanmar state television announced on Saturday that Kyaw Moe Tun had been fired for betraying the country, a day after he urged countries to use ""any means necessary"" to reverse a Feb. 1 coup that ousted the nation's elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
""The perpetrators of the unlawful coup against the democratic government of Myanmar have no authority to countermand the legitimate authority of the president of my country,"" Kyaw Moe Tun wrote on Monday to Blinken and Volkan Bozkir, president of the 193-member U.N. General Assembly.
""I wish therefore to confirm to you that I remain Myanmar's permanent representative to the United Nations,"" he said, adding that President Win Myint and Foreign Minister Aung San Suu Kyi appointed him last year and they remain lawfully elected to their roles.
Reuters was unable to reach the military authorities for comment.
The United Nations does not officially recognize the junta as Myanmar's new government as it has received no official notification of any change in government or U.N. representation. 
""We have not received any communication concerning changes in the representation of Myanmar here at the U.N. in New York,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Monday. ""And nor have our colleagues in protocol received any information from the Permanent Mission in Myanmar on any changes in the government."" 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has pledged to mobilize global pressure ""to make sure that this coup fails."" 
As the United States hosts United Nations headquarters in New York City, Kyaw Moe Tun also asked Blinken to ""continue to support my work with the immunities customary to this role.""
""We have not seen any official evidence or request that he be removed and for the time being he is the representative of the Myanmar government,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told reporters on Monday.
If the Myanmar junta, led by General Min Aung Hlaing, tries to seek international recognition by installing a new U.N. envoy it could set off a fight at the world body that could culminate with a vote at the General Assembly.
The United Nations has previously had to address competing claims for representation at the world body.
In September 2011, the General Assembly approved a Libyan request to accredit envoys of the country’s interim government. The move came after the United States, Russia, China and European nations had all recognized the new authorities. 
Elected lawmakers ousted in the Myanmar coup have formed a committee and Kyaw Moe Tun told the U.N. General Assembly on Friday that is the “legitimate and duly elected government of Myanmar and must be recognized by the international community as such.”

Thomas-Greenfield said on Monday she hopes to use Washington's presidency of the U.N. Security Council in March to push for more ""intense discussions"" on Myanmar. The Security Council has voiced concern over the state of emergency, but stopped short of condemning the coup due to opposition by Russia and China.

As well as Suu Kyi and her cabinet, the detainees include doctors and teachers, actors and singers, and other civilians who took part in daily protests, according to figures from The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP).

Some detainees are survivors of prison under the former junta. Some were taken from their homes, hundreds were seized by riot police and soldiers who charged down protests against the coup. Many are held incommunicado.
Myanmar's junta did not respond to requests for comment on the detentions, but has threatened action against those accused of destabilising the country. The army seized power after its allegations of fraud in Nov. 8 elections were rejected.
In one account, Pyae Phyo Naing, the lead doctor at a government hospital, was stitching up a patient's head wound when the police came for him. He had joined the civil disobedience movement encouraging government employees to strike in protest at the new junta and had shut the hospital on Feb. 8, only treating emergency cases.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vernon Jordan, who grew up in the segregated South to become an influential leader in the American civil rights movement, Washington politics and Wall Street, has died at age 85, according to media reports citing his family.
Jordan, who in 1980 was badly wounded by a white supremacist sniper in Indiana, died Monday night, the reports said.
Jordan ""passed away peacefully last evening surrounded by loved ones. We appreciate all of the outpouring of love and affection,"" his daughter Vickee Jordan said, according to CNBC and New York Times reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin. CBS and CNN also reported his death, citing multiple family members.
The NAACP's Legal Defend Fund, where Jordan served on the board of directors, in a statement on Tuesday said it was ""deeply saddened"" by his death, calling him ""an esteemed attorney and leader who helped drive the advancement of civil rights in America over a venerable career."" 
Jordan worked well into his 80s, going back and forth between the jobs at the Gump Akin international law and lobbying firm in Washington and the Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) financial management firm in New York. Representatives for Gump Akin did not respond to a request for comment on the reports. 
Jordan's role as a Washington insider took him all the way to the White House, where he was a close friend, golfing buddy and adviser to President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.
He never held a formal government job, but no one knew better than Jordan how favors, access and requests worked in Washington. In 2018 the Financial Times called him ""one of the most connected men in America.""
Jordan grew up in a housing project in Atlanta before his family bought a home and he was the only black person in his class at DePauw University in rural Greencastle, Indiana. 
After graduating, Jordan earned a law degree from Howard University and returned to Atlanta to work for a civil rights attorney. Among his cases was one that integrated the University of Georgia and Jordan helped escort his two young black clients past jeering protesters on their first day of class.
Jordan later went to work for the NAACP and the United Negro College Fund before becoming head of the National Urban League in 1971.
'ROSA PARKS OF WALL STREET'
After gains in voting rights and equal access laws, Jordan's approach was to push for greater economic opportunities for blacks, even in corporate boardrooms.
At an Urban League event Jordan said he told the organization's corporate benefactors, ""Don't just give us money and don't just show up for the Equal Opportunity Day dinner. That is not enough when you look at black consumer power in this country. It's not enough for you to come and shake our hands and be our friends. We want in.""
Under his leadership, the Urban League began issuing its annual State of Black America reports to assess the social and economic status of black Americans.
U.S. companies such as  American Express  (NYSE:AXP), Xerox (NYSE:XRX), Dow Jones, Bankers Trust, RJR Nabisco, Revlon and Sara Lee put him on their boards, where he was often the only Black member.
""He is kind of the Rosa Parks of Wall Street,"" Harvard historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. said in an interview with the Bloomberg news service. ""He realized that the first phase of the modern civil rights movement was fighting legal segregation but the roots of racism were fundamentally economic.""
Jordan was close to President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s, and Carter reportedly offered him cabinet jobs. Jordan would eventually become critical of Carter, saying he had not delivered on his economic promises to blacks.
In 1980 Jordan was badly wounded as he exited the car of a white woman who was an Urban League member in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Joseph Paul Franklin, a former Ku Klux Klansman and member of the American Nazi Party who was convicted of a series of race-related murders, admitted to the ambush but was acquitted. He told authorities he hated interracial couples.
After 10 years at the Urban League, Jordan wanted something different and joined Gump Akin. Tall and imposing, he earned a reputation for being a charming and persuasive ""Washington wise man."" After Clinton was elected president in 1992, he chose Jordan, whom he had known since the early 1970s, to head his transition team.
In 1999 Jordan became a senior managing director at Lazard with the goal of bringing in new business and advising executives.
In 2008 when Barack Obama was running to be the first black president, Jordan stuck by his longtime friends and supported Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Party's nomination. According to the Financial Times, Jordan told Obama, ""I am too old to trade friendship for race."" 

Jordan's first wife, Shirley Jordan, died of multiple sclerosis in 1985. They had one child. In 1986 he married Ann Dibble.

KEREM SHALOM, Israel (Reuters) - Israel's defence minister said on Tuesday it intends to develop a ""special security arrangement"" with Gulf Arab allies, who share common concerns over Iran.
The United Arab Emirate and Bahrain established formal relations with Israel last year. As part of their U.S.-backed rapprochement, Israel and the UAE have proposed defence and military cooperation.
On a visit to an Israel-Gaza border crossing, Defence Minister Benny Gantz played down a report by public radio Kan that Israel was considering a defence agreement with Gulf Arab countries, but said security ties would be pursued.
""I don't think it's going to be a defence pact but we are going to develop defence relations with every country that we have relations with,"" Gantz told Reuters.
""We have this process of setting up (a) special security arrangement, and within this arrangement we can continue and develop our relations,"" he said.
Gantz declined to go into details on what such an arrangement would entail.
He signalled that Israel had no opposition to the sale, approved during former U.S. President Donald Trump's last days in office, of 50  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s F-35 stealth jets to the UAE. The deal is now under review by U.S. President Joe Biden's administration.
Asked about Israel's view of the sale, Gantz said Israel's ""qualitative military edge"" must be preserved by the United States, adding that the advanced warplane was already in the country's arsenal.
On Monday, the UAE's ambassador to Israel took up his post, pledging to build up new bilateral relations. Israel opened an embassy in Abu Dhabi in January.

Their so-called U.S.-brokered ""Abraham Accords"", joined by Bahrain, have uncorked tourism and commerce between Israel and Gulf Arab countries. Palestinians have been critical of the rapprochement, worried that their own unmet statehood goal might be sidelined.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Experts say that the relatively low hospitalisation and fatality rates in India suggest the coronavirus pandemic is approaching its next phase - largely manageable local outbreaks.
Although a handful of states are reporting a spurt in infections, for a country of 1.35 billion people with limited health facilities and where the practice of wearing masks and social distancing is falling off, the positive trend, if it holds, will be a respite.
It could also help India keep its economy open without any national lockdown.
At more than 11 million, India has reported the highest number of cases in the world after the United States. A government survey suggests its actual cases may be around 300 million, as many young people showed no symptoms.
The death toll stands at 157,248.
Recorded cases have fall continuously since a mid-September peak, before again rising since early February.
Eight of 10 recent infections have been reported by five states, mainly Maharashtra and Kerala. Since a multi-month low in cases and deaths on Feb. 9, India's case count has gone up but the fatality rate has fallen from 0.856% to 0.683% on Monday.
The overall rate for India is 1.4% and 2.2% for the world.
Rajib Dasgupta, an epidemiologist and professor of community health at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said India was witnessing a phase of ""multiple epidemics within a country"" where the entire population is not equally susceptible.
""In this phase, the emphasis has to be a lot more local, a lot of local capacities will be put to test,"" he said.
""The positive thing - what's being seen in Europe - is that as subsequent surges come, as the knowledge has improved, the management is better, both in terms of public health management as well as clinical care, and actually deaths go down.""
Dasgupta said the aim now should be to try and contain the virus within local clusters, instead of measures like inter-state curbs on travellers.
ENDEMIC VIRUS?
Government health official Vinod Kumar Paul told a news conference on Tuesday that India was nowhere close to attaining herd immunity through natural infection or vaccination, requiring states to continue their surveillance. India has so far inoculated more than 12 million people.
The health ministry, however, said 19 of India's three dozen states and federal territories had not reported any deaths in the past 24 hours.
""It's quite possible that we will be now seeing the pandemic transforming into smaller kinds of outbreaks, or endemicity is likely to take place,"" said Subhash Salunke, a former WHO official who advises Maharashtra on its COVID-19 strategy.
Hospitalisation rates have come down, especially in Maharashtra and Kerala that together account for three-quarters of India's 168,627 active cases.
The number of people hospitalised in Kerala each day due to COVID-19 averaged 830 last week, while daily new cases averaged nearly 3,500.
The hospitalisation figure for seven days in mid-September, after the Onam festival which saw increased public gatherings in Kerala, was 2,940, compared with new cases of 3,973 in the same period.
Maharashtra's health department told Reuters only 14% of its 77,000 active patients were in oxygen or intensive-care beds. More than 80% of such beds are now unoccupied, compared with a shortage a few months ago.
Health authorities must, however, remain vigilant, especially in the big cities, the experts said

""There will likely be another wave - likely will not be as big as the first wave because a lot of people got infected in the first round itself - so I think most metros should be ready for a second wave,"" said Ramanan Laxminarayan, founder of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy in New Delhi.

Katerina Borisevich had reported that there was no alcohol in the bloodstream of protester Roman Bondarenko when he died.
Artyom Sorokin, the doctor who had shared Bondarenko's medical report with Borisevich, was given a suspended sentence. 
The death of 31-year-old Bondarenko became a flashpoint in months of mass protests against veteran President Alexander Lukashenko, who launched a violent crackdown that has triggered Western sanctions on Minsk but support from Russia.

PARIS (Reuters) - Global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has accused Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and several top officials of committing crimes against humanity in a criminal complaint filed in Germany.
The 500-page complaint, filed on Monday with the German Public Prosecutor General in the Karlsruhe federal court, includes allegations of arbitrary detention of more than 30 journalists and the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.
Prince Mohammed has denied any involvement in Khashoggi's killing. Other Saudi figures named in the RSF filing could not be reached for comment and the Saudi government's media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
""Those responsible for the persecution of journalists in Saudi Arabia, including the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, must be held accountable for their crimes,"" RSF Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said in a statement.
RSF said it filed the lawsuit in Germany because of its principle of universal jurisdiction, allowing its courts to prosecute crimes against humanity committed anywhere, and that other names could be added to the complaint at a later stage.
The German prosecutor's office said it had received the complaint and was assessing the legal and factual merits of it.
Germany's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The other officials named in the RSF complaint were Saud al-Qahtani, who was seen as the crown prince's right-hand man; Ahmed Mohammed al-Asiri, a former royal court adviser; Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a general; and Mohammad al-Otaibi, the Saudi Istanbul Consul General at the time of Khashoggi's murder.
The filing follows the publishing of a declassified intelligence assessment by the United States last Friday which concluded that Prince Mohammed approved the operation to ""kill or capture"" Khashoggi. 
Washington also announced visa bans on some Saudis it believes were involved in the killing and imposed sanctions on others.

Saudi Arabia said it completely rejected ""the negative, false and unacceptable"" intelligence assessment.

PARIS (Reuters) - Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative political allies and his singer-songwriter wife have rallied to the defence of the former French president after a court convicted him of corruption, but his leftist foes hailed the verdict, saying justice had been served.
A Paris court on Monday ruled that Sarkozy, 66, had tried to bribe a judge after leaving office, and to peddle influence in exchange for confidential information about an investigation into his 2007 campaign finances.
In a stunning fall from grace for a man who as president from 2007 to 2012 bestrode the national and global stage, Sarkozy was handed a three year jail sentence, suspended for two, though he is unlikely to spend any time behind bars.
Sarkozy, who denies wrongdoing and is expected to appeal, stayed uncharacteristically silent after the verdict, but Carla Bruni-Sarkozy said she was confident her husband would eventually be exonerated.
""What senseless persecution, my love. The fight goes on, the truth will emerge,"" the former supermodel, whom Sarkozy wed in 2008 after a whirlwind romance, said on Instagram.
Sarkozy still holds influence over his old centre-right party, now known as Les Republicains (LR), and party stalwarts were quick to restate their long-standing view that a string of criminal investigations against him were politically motivated.
""The severity of the sentence is disproportionate and indicative of the judicial harassment by an already highly contested institution,"" said Christian Jacob, LR party leader.
Some Sarkozy loyalists had hoped he might be persuaded to come out of political retirement and run for president again in next year's vote, but his conviction has shattered that aspiration. 
CORRUPTION
For decades, corruption in French politics was common, though often went unpunished, commentators say.
Sarkozy's conservative predecessor, the late Jacques Chirac, was found guilty of corruption in 2011. Sarkozy's prime minister, Francois Fillon, was handed a jail sentence last June for embezzling funds in a scandal that wrecked his own 2017 presidential bid. Fillon has appealed his sentence.
President Emmanuel Macron's election victory that year was in part a revolt against dirty politics and a political elite disconnected from voters. 
Macron has not reacted to Monday's verdict and most of the ministers in his government poached from the centre-right benches have stayed quiet, with the notable exception of Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, a former Sarkozy protege.
""Everyone knows the affection and respect I have for Nicolas Sarkozy, who was a great president and who, in these difficult times, has my friendly support,"" Darmanin said.
Some of Sarkozy's political opponents were less forgiving.
""Sarkozy Convicted. Justice for All,"" was the front-page headline of left-leaning newspaper Liberation on Tuesday.

Eric Piolle, the Green party mayor of Grenoble, said: ""Sentences must be carried out. Not enforcing sentences is the same as impunity.""

VIENNA/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Austria and Denmark, chafing at the slow rollout of COVID-19 vaccines within the European Union, have joined forces with Israel to produce second-generation vaccines against mutations of the coronavirus.
The move by the two EU member states comes amid rising anger over delays in ordering, approving and distributing vaccines that have left the 27-member bloc trailing far behind Israel's world-beating vaccination campaign. 
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said it was right that the EU procures vaccines for its member states but the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had been too slow to approve them and lambasted pharmaceutical companies' supply bottlenecks. 
""We must therefore prepare for further mutations and should no longer be dependent only on the EU for the production of second-generation vaccines,"" the conservative chancellor said in a statement on Tuesday. Danish Prime Minister Danish Mette Frederiksen was also critical of the EU's vaccine programme. 
""I don’t think it can stand alone, because we need to increase capacity. That is why we are now fortunate to start a partnership with Israel,"" she told reporters on Monday. 
When asked whether Denmark and Austria wanted to take unilateral action in obtaining vaccines, Frederiksen said: “You can call it that.” 
The European Commission said member states were free to strike separate deals should they wish to. ""It’s not that the strategy unravelled or it goes against the strategy, not at all,"" spokesman Stefan de Keersmaecker said.
An EMA spokeswoman did not have an immediate comment.
FIRST MOVERS?
Kurz and Frederiksen are due to travel to Israel this week to see Israel's rapid vaccine roll-out up close. 
Israel, which was quick to sign contracts for and to approve vaccines from U.S. drug makers  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), has given 94 doses per 100 people and the EU just seven, according to monitoring by Our World in Data. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has made the campaign a showcase of his bid for re-election on March 23, has spoken of ""an international corporation for manufacturing vaccines"".
None of the three countries has significant vaccine making capacity, however, raising questions over how realistic their ambitions are to gain greater self-sufficiency. 
A growing number of EU countries have placed side orders for vaccines from Russia and China, even though the EMA has yet to rule on whether they are both safe and effective. 
Slovakia said on Monday it had ordered 2 million doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine and expects half to arrive this month to help it end a surge in infections.
The neighbouring Czech Republic - tackling the worst COVID-19 outbreak of any EU country - is also considering ordering Russia's Sputnik V. 
Hungary, meanwhile, has taken delivery of a vaccine developed by China's Sinopharm, with Prime Minister Viktor Orban announcing on Sunday that he had received the shot.
The three vaccines so far cleared for use in the EU, made by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), rely on production in countries including Germany, Britain, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands. 
Kurz said Austria and Denmark would work with Israel on vaccine production against mutations of the coronavirus and jointly research treatment options in an alliance called the First Movers Group.
The initiative, which seeks greater protection against future pandemics in addition to joint EU vaccine supply, follows Germany's decision last month to set up a task force to address supply bottlenecks and boost local manufacturing.
Kurz invited pharmaceutical companies with a local presence including Pfizer, Valneva, Novartis, Polymun and Boehringer Ingelheim on Tuesday to discuss the new initiative.
Pfizer, which declined comment for this story, has said it will make 2 billion doses this year - 70% of them in the EU - and has conducted extensive research into their effectiveness against coronavirus variants.

A spokesman for Boehringer Ingelheim said its focus was not on human vaccines ""but if we receive requests we will of course look into them.""

Gorbachev, who championed arms control and democracy-oriented reforms as Soviet leader in the 1980s, is widely credited with helping end the Cold War.
His critics in Russia blame him for what they regard as the unnecessary and painful breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Gorbachev has been in quarantine in hospital for months as a precaution during the coronavirus pandemic, and will host a virtual party with close friends and staff from his foundation, Gorbachev's spokesman Vladimir Polyakov said. 
""We'll raise our glasses,"" he said. ""We'll gather here and he'll be there and we'll see each other and make toasts.""
Polyakov said messages of congratulations had rolled in from world leaders, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 
Putin, who has lamented the Soviet breakup, sent Gorbachev a congratulatory telegram, which was published on the Kremlin website.
""You rightfully belong to the galaxy of bright, extraordinary people, outstanding statesmen of our time who have had a significant influence on the course of domestic and world history,"" said Putin.
Gorbachev's legacy has been partially unpicked in recent years as Moscow and Washington's ties retreated to post-Cold War lows, a process that sped the demise of a treaty that banned the two nations from deploying land-based ballistic missiles with certain ranges.
Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and rows over sanctions, alleged political meddling, and geopolitics have further soured U.S.-Russia ties.
Gorbachev has warned against a return to the Cold War and urged Moscow and Washington to keep talking to each other, regardless of their differences. 
Latvia's Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics tweeted that Latvians were grateful to Gorbachev. 
""His perestroika and (glasnost reforms) were intended to save the Soviet Union, instead they sped up the collapse of the Communist empire paving the way to freedom for millions,"" he wrote.
At a play about his life staged in Moscow last month, many spectators spoke highly of Gorbachev.
""He is a man of his age. He changed our country. He is a daring man,"" said Jamila Iskandera. 
But on Moscow's streets, many took a harsher view.
""He's a windbag ... He was not prepared to guide such a big and great state,"" said Vyacheslav Sokolov. 

""I was born in the Soviet Union, and I think it was a big mistake to ruin the Soviet Union,"" said Irina Baychenko, another Muscovite.

LONDON (Reuters) - Three men and a woman pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to a charge of criminal damage over their alleged role in the toppling of a statue of 17th century slave trade magnate Edward Colston in Bristol in southwest England last year.
The statue was pulled down and tossed into Bristol harbour during an anti-racism demonstration on June 7 that was part of a global wave of Black Lives Matter protests.
The toppling of the statue led to other memorials of figures linked to the slave trade being taken down or their future being debated, triggering a backlash from government ministers who said this amounted to censoring history.
Rhian Graham (NYSE:GHM), Milo Ponsford, Jake Skuse and Sage Willoughby, all in their 20s or 30s, were charged with criminal damage in December and appeared at Bristol Crown Court on Tuesday.
After hearing their pleas of not guilty, judge Peter Blair set Dec. 13 as the start date for their trial, which is expected to last seven or eight days.
Noting that defence lawyers had indicated they would be invoking the European Convention on Human Rights, the judge said he was ""puzzled"" by that.
""I'm struggling to see how the Criminal Damage Act might be said to be interfering with someone's right to free assembly or expression or freedom of thought,"" he said, adding that the defendants risked extra costs if they were found to have run ""wholly unmeritorious"" arguments.
Colston has long been a subject of heated debate in his home city of Bristol, where he donated lavishly to charitable causes, using the fortune he made investing in the slave-trading Royal African Company. 
Years of calls by anti-racism campaigners for his statue to be removed had met with fierce local resistance, until protesters took matters into their own hands last June.
After a few days at the bottom of the harbour, the statue was retrieved by city authorities and put into storage. It is expected to eventually be exhibited in a museum.

In September, a concert hall that was named after Colston renamed itself the Bristol Beacon.

Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, was transferred on Monday from the private King Edward VII hospital to St Bartholomew's Hospital, which is a centre of excellence for cardiac care, for tests for a pre-existing heart condition and treatment for an unspecified infection which is not COVID-related.
His 14-night stay in hospital is the longest he has needed treatment, although Buckingham Palace has said he is comfortable and responding to treatment.
Last week, his youngest son Prince Edward said his father was feeling a lot better but the palace says Philip is expected to remain in hospital until the end of the week at least.
The queen, 94, has remained at Windsor Castle, west of London, where the couple have been staying during the coronavirus lockdown, and has continued to carry out her official duties, albeit remotely. 
Both she and Philip have received their first COVID-19 vaccine dose. 

Although son and heir Prince Charles visited Philip at the King Edward VII Hospital, visitors are only allowed into clinical areas of St Bartholomew's for very limited reasons, such as seeing a patient who is at the end of their life.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - A 19-year-old Pakistani student who shot to fame after her five-second video went viral on social media across the subcontinent, hopes numerous renditions of her monologue will translate into more dialogue between rival neighbours India and Pakistan.
The short video shot by Dananeer Mobeen in the Nathaigali mountains of northern Pakistan and uploaded onto Instagram shows a group of youngsters enjoying themselves by a roadside.
Swinging around the device she is filming on, Mobeen gestures behind her and says in Urdu, ""This is our car, this is us, and this is our party taking place.""
Seemly innocuous, she deliberately mispronounces the English word ""party"" as ""pawri"" to poke fun at South Asians who adopt Western accents. It immediately struck a chord in both India and Pakistan, sparking top trending hashtags on social media, and garnering millions of views and hundreds of spin-offs.
""It was the most random video. I initially had no intention of uploading it,"" Mobeen said, expressing surprise at how viral it had gone and adding the trend showed the power and reach of social media.
""Pawri"" monologue renditions have been used by police in India and the Delhi Commission for Women in their social media outreach campaigns.
In one video, two Indian soldiers deployed in snowy mountains give it their own spin with ""This is us, this is our gun, and we are patrolling here"", while popular Bollywood actors Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone each did a version that also went viral.
Indian dairy company Amul, known for inculcating trendy takes on current issues in its advertisements, did a ""this is our pav-tea"" version https://twitter.com/Amul_Coop/status/1362262247809028100?s=20, in a nod to a popular bread snack eaten with tea.
Even politicians jumped on the bandwagon, with a leader from India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party using the catchy hook at an election rally. 
""I'm honoured and grateful for all the love across the border,"" said Mobeen, expressing her happiness at fostering some rare friendly cross-border dialogue.
India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed nations, have fought three wars and often had tense relations since gaining independence in 1947. 
Relations had most recently soured over developments in the northern region of Kashmir, which both countries control in parts but claim in full. 
Last week, their militaries released a rare joint statement saying they had agreed to observe a ceasefire along the disputed Kashmir border, after exchanging fire hundreds of times over past months.

Since the video went viral, Mobeen said she has been inundated with acting and modelling offers, along with requests for product endorsements. Instead, she says she aspires to join Pakistan's foreign services.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - The leader of Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang (KMT) said on Tuesday he is in no rush to travel to China to meet President Xi Jinping, and that Beijing's proposals to get Taiwan to accept Communist rule had ""no market"" on the island.
The KMT ruled China before retreating to Taiwan at the end of a civil war with the Communists in 1949. While ties across the Taiwan Strait have improved dramatically in the last three decades, Beijing continues to claim Taiwan as its own territory.
The KMT was trounced in presidential and parliamentary elections last year, unable to shake accusations by the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party that they were Beijing's lackey. 
Johnny Chiang, elected as leader following the party's defeat, told Reuters that he was in no hurry to follow his predecessors footsteps and visit Beijing to meet old adversary the Communist Party, and its leader Xi.
""We can wait, for a better timing. There's no insistence for it. It's not just a meeting for a meetings sake, but it needs to be meaningful, respectful,"" he said at party headquarters in central Taipei, adding the pandemic also made travel hard now.
""The timing needs to be right, but more importantly there needs to be the precondition of equality and dignity, and it has to be beneficial for Taiwan.""
Chiang said they were maintaining routine contacts with the Communist Party, but there had been no high level communication. 
Xi met then-President Ma Ying-jeou in Singapore in 2015 in a landmark meeting, shortly before current President Tsai Ing-wen first won power. That meeting was cast as a meeting between the heads of the Communist Party and the KMT rather than one between heads of state.
But political trust has ""collapsed"" since then, with small issues turning into slanging matches between Taipei and Beijing, said Chiang. 
He faces an uphill struggle to win back voter support at a time when Chinese pressure on Taiwan is unrelenting and many electors view the KMT - whose name literally translates as Chinese Nationalist Party - as not properly Taiwanese.
In July he faces re-election as party leader, though he reiterated he has no interest in running for president and would rather serve as a ""kingmaker"" in choosing its candidate for elections in 2024. 
But being firm with autocratic China will be an important test of whether the KMT can get back into power - Chiang described China as the major threat Taiwan faces.
Chiang said that China's offer of using ""one country, two systems"" to entice Taiwan with a high degree of autonomy, like how Beijing is supposed to run unrest-hit Hong Kong, has ""no market"" on the island, where people like their freedoms.

""We are already used to this kind of lifestyle. If you want Taiwan's people to change it - impossible.""

PARIS (Reuters) - Lawyers representing survivors of a chemical weapons attack in 2013 in Syria have filed a criminal complaint against Syrian officials whom they blame for the deaths of hundreds of civilians in a rebel-held area.
France is home to thousands of Syrian refugees, and its investigating judges have a mandate to determine whether crimes against humanity were committed anywhere in the world.
The case, which about a dozen people have joined, follows a similar one opened in Germany last year. It offers a rare legal avenue for action against the government of President Bashar al-Assad.
Attempts by Western powers to set up an international tribunal for Syria have been blocked by Russia and China at the U.N. Security Council.
""This is important so that the victims have the possibility to see those responsible being brought to justice and held accountable,"" Mazen Darwish, who heads the Paris-based Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM), told Reuters. 
The SCM filed the complaint along with two other NGOs: the Open Society Foundation’s Justice Initiative and Syrian Archive.
France's intelligence services concluded in 2013 that a sarin gas attack on the Eastern Ghouta region just south east of Damascas that killed 1,400 people had been carried out by Syrian government forces.
The Syrian government denies it has used chemical weapons against its own civilians.
The complaint is based on what the lawyers say is the most comprehensive body of evidence on the use of substances such as sarin gas in Syria.
They include testimonies from survivors and defectors, an analysis of the Syrian military chain of command, and hundreds of items of documentary evidence, including photos and videos.
""We have compiled extensive evidence establishing exactly who is responsible for these attacks on Douma and Eastern Ghouta, whose horrific effects continue to impact survivors,"" said Hadi al Khatib, founder and director of Syrian Archive. 
A U.N.-commissioned investigation to identify those behind chemical weapons attacks in Syria concluded in 2016 that Syrian government forces had used chlorine and sarin gas.

Darwish said he expected another case to be opened in Sweden in the coming months.

The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which oversees a system for countries to share recognition of patents, said China filed 68,720 applications last year while the United States filed 59,230.
The rate of increase was higher for China with a 16.1% year-on-year increase versus 3% for the United States, it added. China first knocked the United States from the top spot in 2019.
Daren Tang, WIPO director-general, said the rise in Chinese filings was part of a longer-term trend for higher applications from Asia more broadly, with South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia all submitting more applications last year. 
""It's not as if filings from the traditional parts of the world like the U.S. or Europe have decreased, it's just that the rate, the acceleration, has become a lot stronger in Asia,"" he told journalists.
The region accounted for more than half of all filings via WIPO's system known as the Patent Cooperation Treaty versus just over a third ten years ago.
Unlike after the 2008 financial crisis when filings fell sharply, overall filings via WIPO's system were up 4% overall in 2020 to a new record despite the COVID-19-induced slowdown, it said.
""The trend is that innovation remains resilient and the sense is that the world needs more innovation ... during a crisis,"" said Tang.
The biggest single filer under this system last year was China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for the fourth consecutive year and second was South Korea's Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd, WIPO said.

Singapore's Tang began his term in October and received strong support from Western countries including the United States in a highly politicised race against a Chinese candidate for the top job last year.

The Southeast Asian nation has been mulling the idea of so-called ""vaccine passports"", but no target date has been set and tourism operators have complained about lost revenue.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said Thailand will proceed with caution, waiting to see how effective vaccines are first in preventing the spread of COVID-19. 
""I have already ordered the study so we can be prepared, but it's also important that we proceed in line with other countries,"" Prayuth said in a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Tuesday. 
People in Thailand who are vaccinated would be given certificates, which could be used for international travel, he said. 
Thai authorities will meet next week to discuss procedures to obtain such certificates, as well as quarantine arrangements for tourists with ""vaccine passports"" entering Thailand. 
Previously, officials have said vaccinated visitors could have mandatory quarantine cut from two weeks to three days or waived entirely. 
The global vaccine rollout has given hope to the pandemic-hit tourism industry, which makes up about 11% of Southeast Asia's second-largest economy. 
In 2020, Thailand's tourism revenue slumped to 332 billion baht ($10.94 billion) from 1.91 trillion baht a year earlier, as visitor numbers plunged by 83%.

1319,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 03:36AM ET</span>",Clergy lead a rare Christian revival in Iraqi town welcoming pope,"By Charlotte Bruneau
QARAQOSH, Iraq (Reuters) - As Islamic State fighters advanced across northern Iraq in 2014, Mazen Shemes' nine-year-old son was killed by a mortar. The family had to bury him quickly before fleeing the same night, along with thousands of other Christian families.
Five years later the 47-year-old farmer returned to the town of Qaraqosh, part of a wave of people who, supported by church leaders, re-populated its empty streets and rebuilt homes left in ruins by extremist militants and the fighting that ousted them.
""This is our land. We can't just abandon it and leave,"" said Shemes, standing in his garden where young trees are growing.
About half of the Christian enclave of Qaraqosh has come back since Islamic State was defeated in 2017, a rare sign of hope for a community devastated by Iraq's descent into Islamist violence after the U.S. invasion in 2003.
Iraq's Christian population of 1.5 million some 20 years ago stands at 300,000, and many of those want to leave because they see few prospects in a war-torn country where Shi'ite militias and sleeper militant cells still pose a threat.
Pope Francis will visit the town's restored Grand Immaculate Church - Iraq's largest - on Sunday as part of a four-day tour of the country designed to boost morale and highlight the difficulties some Christian communities face.
For the Catholic clergy who led the reconstruction work and helped families return to the town near Mosul - Islamic State's de-facto capital - his trip is a source of huge pride.
""We try to do as much as we can,"" said Father Ammar Yako, a local Syriac Catholic priest who has been supervising the renovation of the Grand Immaculate Church in Qaraqosh since 2019. ""But then, God remains the one who decides what will happen to us.""
REBUILD, REVIVE
Among the first to return to the town, the main centre of Hamdaniya district, after liberation from Islamic State were the clergy.
Embedded with security forces just after they retook Qaraqosh, Father Ammar recalled his shock at seeing the destruction.
""Over 2,000 houses were burned,"" he said. Others were torn apart by airstrikes against the militants. There was no water or electricity.
The imposing Grand Immaculate Church had been desecrated by the militants and ravaged by fire. But Father Ammar was thankful that it was, at least, still standing.    ""I started thinking that maybe we would be able to rebuild it.""
Local church leaders from different denominations devised a plan to encourage families to come back to the town of 50,000 people, raising funds mainly from foreign Christian non-governmental organisations.
""We decided to start by rebuilding houses so that people would come home,"" said Syriac Catholic Archbishop of Mosul Yohanna Petros Mouche, adding that churches would come next. Father Georges Jahola was put in charge.
    With a team of around 20, Father Georges started to map the city, assess the damage and allocate funds to support families who began to trickle back. Over half the damaged homes have been restored.
But reconstruction funds have dried up, preventing Father Georges from completing the work. Some 2,000 houses in the town remain empty, and church leaders are opposed to the idea of allowing Iraqis from other areas to move in.
""If we lose our land, we lose our identity,"" Father Georges explained, poring over a map showing the Christian enclave of Qaraqosh surrounded by land allocated to other religious groups that locals feel could endanger their town's identity.
Father Ammar hopes worshippers will soon be able to pray again regularly in the Grand Immaculate Church, a grey and yellow stone building with a distinct red roof that stands out among the surrounding houses.

Volunteers were recently cleaning and decorating the building ahead of the pope's visit. Traces of burning inside the church were left untouched, a reminder of the fragility of the Christian community in Iraq.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 03:30AM ET</span>",China's electoral reform 'earthquake' set to upend Hong Kong politics,"By James Pomfret and Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's plan to dramatically reform Hong Kong's electoral system, expected to be unveiled in a parliamentary session in Beijing starting this week, will upend the territory's political scene, according to more than a dozen politicians from across the spectrum.
The proposed reform will put further pressure on pro-democracy activists, who are already the subject of a crackdown on dissent, and has ruffled the feathers of some pro-Beijing loyalists, some of whom may find themselves swept aside by a new and ambitious crop of loyalists, the people said.
""It will be an earthquake shaking up local political interests,"" said one person briefed on the impending changes.
The measures will be introduced at the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament, which starts on Friday, according to media reports.
The plan was signalled last week by senior Chinese official Xia Baolong, who said Beijing would introduce systemic changes to only allow what he called ""patriots"" to hold public office in Hong Kong.
In a full transcript of his remarks published this week by the pro-Beijing Bauhinia Magazine, Xia said Hong Kong's electoral system had to be ""designed"" to fit with the city's situation and shut out what he called non-patriots, some of whom he described as ""anti-China agitators"" that would bring destruction and terror to the city - a reference to pro-democracy campaigners who took to the streets in sometimes violent demonstrations in 2019. 
Xia did not announce any specifics, but the plan will likely include changes to how the 70-seat Hong Kong legislature is elected, and the composition of a committee that will select Hong Kong's next leader, according to the person briefed on the plan and local media reports.
Veteran democrats have been quick to condemn the plan.
""It totally destroys any hope for democracy in the future,"" said Lee Cheuk-yan, a pro-democracy former member of Hong Kong’s legislature. ""The whole concept of Xia Baolong is that the Communist Party rules Hong Kong and only those that support the party can have any role.""
Lee learned of the impending reform last week, in the middle of his trial, along with a group of eight other pro-democracy activists, for unlawful assembly charges related to a protest in August 2019. 
""It's no longer for people to decide,"" Lee told Reuters on a lunch break from the trial last week. ""It's one party rule, completely.""
The prospect of further bending the electoral process to China’s liking has also worried some pro-Beijing figures, who think it may be going too far and ultimately hurt Hong Kong.
""Don't go too far and kill the patient,"" Shiu Sin-por, a pro-Beijing politician and former head of Hong Kong's Central Policy Unit, told reporters after a briefing session with Xia on the matter. The opposition camp has already been neutralised by last year’s national security law, Shiu said, allowing the government to ""push forward policies smoothly.""
China's main liaison office in Hong Kong, and China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, did not respond to requests for comment.
The Hong Kong government said in a statement that it was prioritising the implementation of the principle of ""patriots ruling Hong Kong"" and improving the electoral system, and that it will continue to listen to views on the matter.
POLITICAL MATHEMATICS
Electoral reform is the latest political tremor to hit Hong Kong, a former colony that Britain handed back to China in 1997, which retains some autonomy from Beijing and whose status as a global financial hub was built on the rule of law and civil liberties not allowed in mainland China.
The city’s atmosphere has changed radically in the past 18 months. Mass street protests in 2019 against China's intensifying control prompted Beijing to impose a sweeping national security law last June, which authorities have used to jail activists and stifle dissent.
On Sunday, Hong Kong police charged 47 pro-democracy campaigners and activists with conspiracy to commit subversion for their roles in organising and participating in an unofficial primary election last July, the biggest single crackdown under the new law.
Even though such arrests have already marginalised the pro-democracy camp, China wants to exert greater control over a voting process largely unchanged since 1997, and is still afraid of democrats winning a majority in the legislature at the next election, said the person briefed on the electoral reform plan.
""They did the mathematics and it was seen as too risky to do nothing,"" said the person.
Two senior pro-Beijing politicians told Reuters the electoral reform plan, coming on top of the broader crackdown that has already provoked international criticism, would ultimately damage Hong Kong, potentially destroying its unique character, pluralism and attractiveness for investors.
""It's really sad that Hong Kong has degenerated to this stage,"" said one of the politicians, on the electoral reform. ""We're handing Hong Kong over to the next generation in a worse state than we inherited it.""
The two pro-Beijing politicians spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, due to the sensitivity of the matter. It is rare for pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong to voice any doubt about China’s moves, even anonymously.   
""Nothing is normal anymore,” said the second pro-Beijing politician. “It's a new abnormal.""
One faction that appears ready to benefit from electoral reform is the new Bauhinia Party, formed in May by Charles Wong and two other mainland-born, pro-Beijing businessmen, pushing policies that Wong says will help revive Hong Kong and its leadership. 
""They (Beijing) never really have any opposition to what we do,"" Wong told Reuters in his 12th-floor seafront office last week. 
Wong, 56, was born in mainland China but came to Hong Kong as a youth and speaks fluent Cantonese, the local dialect. Describing himself as a ""patriot,"" Wong embodies China's declared wish to have Hong Kong run at all levels by people with closer ties and sympathy with the mainland. 

""We are Hong Kong people,"" he told Reuters. ""We love Hong Kong.""

1321,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 03:05AM ET</span>",South Korea says up to medical personnel to extract extra doses of COVID vaccine from vial,"By Sangmi Cha
SEOUL (Reuters) - A decision by South Korean health authorities to allow more doses to be extracted from coronavirus vaccine vials sparked controversy on Tuesday as the country ramped up its vaccinations of healthcare workers and the elderly.
The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) had allowed healthcare workers to use the remaining doses if they can squeeze more out of each vial with low dead space syringes, which minimize the amount of vaccine left in the syringe after use.
While offering discretion over the use of remaining doses, KDCA made clear the authorities will not make the extraction of the extra doses a new standard or mandatory as it can burden the healthcare workers on site.
Experts were divided about the decision for permitting up to seven doses to be extracted from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccine vials which are made to contain only six using the low dead space syringes, and up to 12 doses from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine, which would otherwise inoculate 10 people with normal syringes.
Eom Joong-sik, professor of infectious diseases at Gachon University Gil Medical Center, warned of the risk of contamination during inaccurate extraction of the extra seventh dose.
A worker trying to combine leftovers from two vials to make a full dose could lead to such problems, Eom said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
The government hasn't made it mandatory to squeeze extra dose out of a vial and there is a designated person in charge of extraction in large medical centres, which makes it easier for them to draw an extra dose safely, said Ki Mo-ran, professor of cancer control and population health at National Cancer Center.
KDCA said 23,086 people were given first doses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer shots by Monday midnight. 

South Korea has reported 344 new cases on Monday, adding to the total tally of 90,372, with 1,606 deaths.

Zhong Nanshan, a coronavirus expert who helped shape China's COVID-19 response, said on Monday the current ratio of vaccine doses administered per 100 people in China is 3.56, much lower than those in Israel, United Arab Emirates and the United States.
In an online forum held by China's Tsinghua University and the Washington-based Brookings Institution on Monday, Zhong said the target was 40% by the end of June, citing his contacts at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
However, in a phone call with Reuters on Tuesday, Zhong clarified that 40% target would be hit in July, after taking into account the proportion of people who do not want to be vaccinated.
The 40% by the end of July would include people who have received either one dose or two doses, Zhong said. Three Chinese-made vaccines require two shots, while another one requires a single dose.
China, which has approved four locally developed coronavirus vaccines for use on the general public, had administered 50.52 million doses as of Feb. 28, Zhong said.
Authorities had aimed to vaccinate 50 million people before the Lunar New Year in February, official media outlet Global Times reported in January.

Sinovac Biotech's vaccine has been used in mass vaccination drives in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. CanSino Biologics Inc has agreed to supply millions of doses to Mexico.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 01:50AM ET</span>",Boeing to base U.S. Air Force prototype on Australian pilotless combat jet,"By Jamie Freed
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co will use a pilotless, fighter-like jet developed in Australia as the basis for its U.S. Air Force Skyborg prototype, an executive at the plane maker said on Tuesday.
The ""Loyal Wingman"", the first military aircraft to be designed and manufactured in Australia in more than 50 years, made its first flight on Saturday under the supervision of a Boeing test pilot monitoring it from a ground control station in South Australia. 
Boeing's Loyal Wingman is 38 feet long (11.6 metres), has a 2,000 nautical mile (3,704 km) range and a nose that can be outfitted with various payloads. The plane can also carry weapons and act as a shield to help protect more expensive manned fighter jets.
The U.S. Air Force in December awarded multi-million dollar contracts to Boeing, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems and Kratos Defense (NASDAQ:KTOS) and Security Solutions to produce unmanned aerial prototypes that can team with crewed jets. 
""The airpower teaming system is the basis for our Skyborg bid,"" Boeing airpower teaming programme director Shane Arnott told reporters. ""Obviously the U.S. market is a big market. That is a focus for us, achieving some sort of contract or programme of record in the United States.""
Defence contractors are investing increasingly in autonomous technology as militaries around the world look for cheaper and safer ways to maximise their resources.
Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, is home to Boeing's largest footprint outside the United States and has vast airspace with relatively low traffic for flight testing.
The Australian government said on Tuesday it would invest a further A$115 million ($89 million) to acquire three more Loyal Wingman aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) to develop tactics for using the jets with crewed planes, on top of its initial investment of A$40 million. 
""Our aim with Boeing is to understand how we can get these aircraft to team with our existing aircraft to be a force multiplier in the future,"" RAAF Air-Vice Marshal and head of air force capability Cath Roberts said.
Britain in January signed a GBP 30 million ($42 million) contract with the Belfast unit of Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR) for a similar type of pilotless aircraft to have a trial flight in the next three years.
During the test flight in Australia, the Loyal Wingman took off under its own power before flying a pre-determined route at different speeds and altitudes to verify its functionality and demonstrate the performance of the design.
Arnott said that three Loyal Wingman aircraft would be used for teaming flights this year and that the Australian government's order would take the number available to six.
Boeing has said up to 16 Loyal Wingman jets could be teamed with a crewed aircraft for missions.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The proceedings for 47 Hong Kong democracy activists charged with conspiracy to commit subversion resume on Tuesday, following a marathon hearing that extended well past midnight before it was adjourned after one of the defendants fainted.
Lawyers for the defendants are challenging a prosecution bid to deny them bail and keep them in custody for up to three months while police investigate.
Democrat and district councillor Clarisse Yeung fainted in the courtroom after midnight and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. Her condition was not immediately disclosed.
Local media reported three other defendants fainted after the hearings were adjourned.
On Monday, about 1,000 supporters gathered outside the West Kowloon courthouse as the defendants, charged under the Chinese-ruled city's contentious national security law, faced charges after their arrest over the weekend.
The crowd chanted slogans such as ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"" and with many dressed in black, the images were reminiscent of scenes during anti-government demonstrations that roiled the city in 2019.
The activists are accused of organising and participating in an unofficial primary poll last July aimed at selecting the strongest candidates for a legislative council election that the government later postponed, citing the coronavirus. 
Authorities said the informal poll was part of a plan to ""overthrow"" the government, stoking concerns alarm that Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn since Beijing imposed the security law on the former British colony in June.
The detentions have drawn international condemnation and accusations that the governments in Hong Kong and Beijing are using the law to crush dissent and stifle the opposition.
U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Monday Washington called on Hong Kong authorities to release those still held and drop charges against them.

Beijing has said the security legislation, which punishes what it broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, is necessary to restore stability in Hong Kong.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australian police said on Tuesday an investigation into a rape allegation against an unidentified cabinet minister was closed after authorities concluded there was insufficient evidence.
Several opposition Australian lawmakers said late last week they had received a letter detailing an allegation of rape against a male cabinet minister before he entered parliament.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the allegation had been referred to the Australian Federal Police (AFP), although the minister had ""vigorously rejected"" the allegation in a conversation with him.
On Tuesday, the AFP said it would not investigate as it did not have jurisdiction and police in New South Wales (NSW) - where the alleged crime is reported to have occurred in 1988 - also ruled out an investigation.
""AFP's role is to liaise and support and provide whatever advice those jurisdictions need in this matter,"" AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw told Australia's Channel 9.
NSW Police said they had concluded there was insufficient evidence.
""NSW Police Force has determined the matter is now closed,"" it said in an e-mail.
It said also the alleged victim did not make a formal statement to them detailing her account before she committed suicide last year.
NSW Police did obtain a ""personal document"" purportedly made by the woman, but had been legally advised this was insufficient to proceed with an investigation, it said.
While the ruling means Morrison will not have to suspend the minister as directed by parliamentary rules, it does little to ease pressure on his government.
Three former staff members of the ruling Liberal party said last month they had been raped by an unidentified colleague.
One victim who went public with her allegations has made an official police complaint.
Morrison's government said on Tuesday it had established an independent and confidential 24/7 telephone service for current and former parliamentary employees to report allegations of improper conduct.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's Mount Sinabung volcano sent a cloud of hot ash as high as 5 km (3.1 miles) on Tuesday, in its first big eruption since August last year, the country's volcanology centre said.
Mount Sinabung's activity has increased since last year and the alert for the volcano in North Sumatra province has been placed at the second-highest level.
No casualties were reported, but an official had earlier urged people to stay at least 3 km from the crater, Indonesia's Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Centre said.
Videos on social media showed little panic among residents over the eruption, which sent a column of white ash into the blue sky.

Indonesia straddles the so-called ""Pacific Ring of Fire"", a highly seismically active zone, where different plates on the earth's crust meet and create a large number of earthquakes and volcanoes.
Indonesia has nearly 130 active volcanoes, more than any other country.

Sinabung had been inactive for centuries before it erupted again in 2010.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is expected to impose sanctions to punish Russia for the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny as early as Tuesday, two sources familiar with the matter said.
President Joe Biden's decision to impose sanctions for Navalny's poisoning reflects a harder stance than taken by his predecessor, Donald Trump, who let the incident last August pass without punitive U.S. action.
Navalny fell ill on a flight in Siberia in August and was airlifted to Germany, where doctors concluded he had been poisoned with a nerve agent. The Kremlin has denied any role in his illness and said it had seen no proof he was poisoned.
The sources said on Monday on condition of anonymity that the United States was expected to act under two executive orders: 13661, which was issued after Russia's invasion of Crimea but provides broad authority to target Russian officials, and 13382, issued in 2005 to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Both orders let the United States freeze the U.S. assets of those targeted and effectively bar U.S. companies and individuals from dealing with them.
The sources said the Biden administration also planned to act under the U.S. Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, which provides a menu of punitive measures.
The sources said some individuals would be targeted in the sanctions to be announced as early as Tuesday, but declined to name them or say what other sanctions may be imposed.
They added, however, that Washington would maintain waivers allowing foreign aid and certain export licenses for Russia.
The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the possibility of sanctions.
A third source said the U.S. action may be coordinated with sanctions the European Union could apply as soon as Tuesday.
EU foreign ministers agreed on Feb. 22 to impose sanctions on four senior Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin in a mainly symbolic response to Navalny's jailing. The EU was expected to formally approve those in early March.
In the case of Navalny, Trump, whose term ended in January, did nothing to punish Russia. Top U.N. human rights experts said on Monday that Moscow was to blame for attempting to kill Navalny as part of a pattern of attacks on critics to quash dissent.
After his medical treatment in Germany, Navalny, 44, returned to Russia in January. He was arrested and later sentenced to more than 2-1/2 years in jail for parole violations he said were trumped up. 
Biden last month called the jailing of Navalny ""politically motivated"" and called for his release. He has pledged a new and tough approach toward Moscow, saying the United States would no longer be ""rolling over"" in the face of aggressive action by Russia.

Washington and Moscow disagree on a wide range of issues on top of Navalny, such as Russia's military ambitions in Ukraine and Georgia, as well as a cyberattack on U.S. government agencies last year that Washington blames on Russia. Moscow has denied responsibility for the hacking campaign.

Venezuelan law states that pretrial detention cannot last more than two years, Penal Forum's directors Alfredo Romero and Gonzalo Himiob told reporters, noting that 49 of the 323 individuals they consider political prisoners have been detained for longer than that amount of time. 
""They are arbitrarily keeping them longer,"" Romero said, adding that 74% of those 323 detainees ""have not even had their trial begin, which is to say, they have not even had one hearing.""
Rights groups, Venezuela's opposition, and Western democracies including the United States have long argued that President Nicolas Maduro's government uses the justice system to quash political dissent. 
Maduro frequently accuses opponents of ""terrorism"" or seeking to oust him in coups. The government denies that Venezuela holds political prisoners.
Neither Venezuela's information ministry nor the country's Chief Prosecutor's office immediately responded to requests for comment on Monday. 
Romero said that 10 of the prisoners monitored by Penal Forum have spent four years behind bars, and four have been awaiting trial for six years. He said 20% of the detainees have had their trials begin, while 6% have pled guilty.
""These people are being used to set an example in criminal procedures that go on forever, making them a tool of political persecution,"" Himiob said. 
The group of 323 prisoners includes 23 women, while the rest are men. At least 123 of the detainees are members of the military. 

Romero added that at least 9,000 people who have been detained since 2014 on political charges are still restricted by probationary measures, including regular court appearances or bans on leaving the country.

Last Tuesday's riots, which left an additional 19 people wounded, were among the bloodiest incidents in the history of the Andean country's penitentiary system and underscored the problems of overcrowding and underfunding that plagued the system.
Authorities initially attributed the riots to rivalries between local gangs. Testifying in front of the National Assembly, Interior Minister Patricio Pazmino said on Monday that those rivalries were linked to international groups disputing for control over Ecuador's drug trade. 
""We are not talking about a simple fight between criminal groups in prisons,"" Pazmino said. ""We are talking about a confrontation between criminal groups with international contacts over illegal markets in the country.""
Without naming specific groups, Pazmino said rivalries between local groups took on an increasingly international dimension in 2017, after the demobilization of the FARC rebel group in neighboring Colombia through a peace deal with the government put an end to decades of civil war. 
Authorities said there have been new attempted riots in the jails since last week's incidents. The most recent took place on Monday morning in the central city of Latacunga, where prisoners held five guards hostage, but the SNAI prison authority said the situation was controlled several hours later. 
""The situation is still tense and complicated,"" Edmundo Moncayo, SNAI's director of social rehabilitation. 
Authorities over the weekend temporarily transferred some prisoners to other facilities due to the risks they could be victims of violent acts in the future. 

The government has said that jails are overcrowded by some 30%, and that a lack of resources and staff has contributed to confrontations between the country's 38,693 inmates.

The two stolen dogs were turned in to police unharmed on Friday but two men suspected of stealing them remain at large.
""I am still in recovery from a very close call with death,"" Fischer, 30, wrote on Instagram alongside pictures of him in a hospital bed, including one that showed him connected to a ventilator.
Describing the episode, Fischer said he let out panicked screams as blood poured from his body from a gunshot wound. Kidnappers had taken two of Gaga's three dogs - Koji and Gustav - but a third, Asia, remained with Fischer. 
""I cradled Asia as best I could, thanked her for all the incredible adventures we'd been on together, apologized that I couldn't defend her brothers, and then resolved that I would still try to save them ... and myself,"" Fischer wrote.
Koji and Gustav were returned unharmed to police on Friday by an unidentified woman and reunited with Gaga's representatives. Gaga had offered a $500,000 reward for her dogs' return.
To Gaga, Fischer said: ""Your babies are back and the family is whole ... we did it! You have shown so much support throughout this whole crisis to both me and my family.""

""A lot of healing still needs to happen,"" Fischer added, ""but I look forward to the future and the moment when I get bombarded with kisses and licks (and maybe even an excitement pee?) from Asia, Koji, and Gustav.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is focused on ""future conduct"" of Saudi Arabia and will expect Riyadh to improve its human rights record, a U.S. spokesman said on Monday, after Washington imposed sanctions on some Saudis for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi but fell short of sanctions against Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The United States on Friday declassified a report that said the crown prince approved an operation in 2018 to capture or kill Khashoggi and issued some sanctions against Saudi nationals and entities.
Washington's failure to penalize the crown prince has been criticized by rights groups and others, raising questions about accountability and the Biden administration's pledge to make human rights a foreign policy priority. 
Prince Mohammed, the 35-year old de facto ruler, has denied any involvement in Khashoggi’s killing, for which eight people were jailed in Saudi Arabia last year, but has said he bears ultimate responsibility because it happened on his watch.
""We are very focused on future conduct and that is part of why we have cast this not as a rupture, but as a recalibration"" of U.S.-Saudi relations, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said at a press briefing.
""We are trying to get to the systemic issues underlying the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi,"" Price said.
The United States welcomed the recent release of two human rights activists in Saudi Arabia, Price said, but asked Riyadh to do more by lifting the travel ban on them.
""We are urging Saudi Arabia to take additional steps – to lift travel bans on those released, to commute sentences and resolve cases such as those women’s rights activists and others,"" he said.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Monday that the United States reserved the right to sanction Mohammed bin Salman.
Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who wrote opinion columns for the Washington Post critical of the crown prince's policies, was killed and dismembered by a team of operatives linked to the prince in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.
On Friday, the United States singled out the Rapid Intervention Force, or RIF, a unit of the Saudi royal guard that has engaged in counter dissident operations. It also issued visa bans on 76 Saudis.

Price said he could not disclose the names of the 76 people and declined to say whether or not Mohammed bin Salman was among them. The United States has urged Saudi Arabia to disband the RIF, Price added.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said on Monday she hopes to use Washington's presidency of the United Nations Security Council in March to push for more ""intense discussions"" on Myanmar. 
Myanmar's elected civilian government was ousted in a military coup on Feb. 1. Myanmar's U.N. Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun appealed to the United Nations on Friday ""to use any means necessary to take action against the Myanmar military"" to restore democracy to the Southeast Asian country.
""I hope to use our time as president of the council to push for more intense discussions,"" Thomas-Greenfield told reporters, adding that she planned to have a Security Council discussion on Myanmar ""sooner rather than later.""
The Security Council voiced concern - in a statement last month - over a state of emergency imposed by the Myanmar military for one year, but stopped short of condemning the coup due to opposition by Russia and China.
Police in Myanmar have dispersed protests against the coup with tear gas, stun grenades and rubber bullets. On Sunday, police fired on crowds in several places, killing 18 people, the U.N. human rights office said.
Thomas-Greenfield said Washington was ready to use its renewed engagement at the United Nations and internationally ""to press the military to reverse its actions and restore a democratically elected government.""
""But the violence we're seeing happening now does not indicate that they're ready to make what I would consider an easy decision for them to make,"" she said. ""So we do have to ramp up the pressure.""
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has pledged to mobilize global pressure ""to make sure that this coup fails."" 
Myanmar state television announced on Saturday that Kyaw Moe Tun had been fired for betraying the country. He told Reuters: ""I decided to fight back as long as I can.""
The United Nations does not officially recognize the junta as Myanmar's new government as it has received no official notification of any change in government or U.N. representation. 

""We have not received any communication concerning changes in the representation of Myanmar here at the U.N. in New York,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Monday. ""And nor have our colleagues in protocol received any information from the Permanent Mission in Myanmar on any changes in the government.""

""The report .. is based on could've, should've and would've and does not rise to anywhere close to proving the accusation beyond reasonable doubt,"" ambassador Abdallah Al-Mouallimi said in a Twitter post.
""The Prince courageously accepted moral responsibility, presented the accused to the justice system, and pledged to reform the intelligence organizations. Case closed!,"" he added.
Prince Mohammed has denied any involvement in Khashoggi’s killing, for which eight people were jailed in Saudi Arabia last year, but has said he bears ultimate responsibility because it happened on his watch.
The U.S. report released on Friday based its assessment that Prince Mohammed approved an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi on the prince's control of decision-making, direct involvement of a key adviser and his own protective detail, and his ""support for using violent measures to silence dissidents abroad, including Khashoggi.""

The Saudi government has rejected the report's findings and repeating its previous statements that Khashoggi's killing was a heinous crime by a rogue group.

The letter, dated Feb. 26 and made public on Monday, notes that NATO ally Turkey has long been an important U.S. partner but says the administration of President Tayyip Erdogan has strained the relationship.
""Strategic issues have rightfully received significant attention in our bilateral relationship, but the gross violation of human rights and democratic backsliding taking place in Turkey are also of significant concern,"" said the letter, whose signers included Representatives Greg Meeks, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Mike McCaul, the panel's ranking Republican member.
Erdogan said on Feb. 20 that the common interests of Turkey and the United States outweigh their differences and Turkey wants improved cooperation with Washington.
But relations have frayed over a host of issues, including Turkey's purchase of a Russian missile defense system and U.S. support for the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria.

Washington has also expressed repeated concern over rights and freedoms. The lawmakers' letter said Erdogan and his party have weakened Turkey's judiciary, installed political allies in key military and intelligence positions, and wrongfully imprisoned political opponents, journalists and members of minority groups.

Agnes Callamard, special rapporteur on summary executions who led a U.N. investigation into Khashoggi's 2018 murder, reiterated her call for sanctions targeting Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's assets and his international engagements.
He approved an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, according to a declassified U.S. intelligence released on Friday as the United States imposed sanctions on some of those involved but spared the crown prince himself in an effort to preserve relations with the kingdom.
Callamard told a Geneva news conference that what had been declassified from the report ""appears to be very little indeed and that's disappointing"" and she would have expected more material evidence to have been released.
""It is extremely problematic, in my view, if not dangerous, to acknowledge someone's culpability and then to tell that someone 'but we won't do anything, please proceed as if have we have said nothing',"" she said. ""That to me is an extremely dangerous move on the part of the USA.""
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Monday that the United States reserves the right to sanction the crown prince in the future if necessary.
""Of course we reserve the right to take any action at a time and manner of our choosing,"" Psaki told reporters, adding that ""Historically, the United States through Democratic and Republican presidents has not typically sanctioned government leaders of countries where we have diplomatic relations.""
U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday said his administration would make an announcement on Saudi Arabia on Monday, but a White House official suggested no significant new steps were expected.

""There are many things that the U.S. government can do. The one thing it cannot do - it cannot do - is to be silent and take no action on their findings,"" Callamard said.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Former pope Benedict has chided conservative Roman Catholics who have not accepted his decision to resign as ""fanatical"", telling them that there is only one pope and it is Francis.
Benedict, now 93, in 2013 became the first pope in more than 600 years to resign instead of ruling for life, saying he no longer had the strength to govern the 1.3 billion-member Church.
Some hardline conservatives unhappy with the more liberal Pope Francis have often voiced doubts about whether Benedict stepped down willingly, even though he has said several times in the past eight years that he did.
""It was a difficult decision. But it was a fully conscious choice and I think I did well (to resign),"" he told Italy's Corriere della Sera in a interview published on Monday.
""Some of my more fanatical friends are still upset, they have not accepted my choice.""
Benedict, who lives in a house in the Vatican gardens, said those who refuse to accept his resignation nursed ""conspiracy theories"" that he had been forced to quit because of scandals such as the leaking of some of his documents by his butler.
""They don't want to believe that it was a conscious choice,"" he said. ""My conscience is clear.""
Apparently addressing those who still look up to him as the real pope and are hostile to Francis, Benedict said: ""There is only one pope.""
The interviewer said Benedict had emphasised the point by thumping the armrest of his chair.
The presence in the Vatican of both a pope and a former pontiff with the title ""pope emeritus"", also wearing white, has irritated some Catholics.

Leading Church figures have called for new rules stipulating that popes who resign resume the lower office of cardinal, do not wear white, and do not make pronouncements on doctrine.

The country's ""Law of Return"" grants Israeli citizenship to any Jew from anywhere in the world, though there have been disputes when it comes to those who have converted to Judaism.
More observant groups in Israel demand a strict Orthodox conversion while the less stringent conservative and reformed movements say they offer a valid alternative.
Until now conservative and reformed conversions carried out overseas were recognized for Israeli citizenship and those done locally were not.
The Supreme Court, saying it was concluding a 15-year legal battle after the government chose to sidestep the issue, ruled that non-Orthodox conversions in Israel would be sufficient for citizenship as well. It did not say how many of such conversions were typically carried out each year.
The ruling only interprets the existing law, the court said, while parliament ""at any time can set a different arrangement in the law"".
Interior Minister Arye Deri, who is an ultra-Orthodox rabbi, called the court decision ""very unfortunate"" and said he would work to amend the law so it only allows conversions done according to strict Jewish law.

Opposition leader Yair Lapid welcomed the ruling, saying, ""We all need to live here in mutual tolerance and respect.""

1343,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 01:05PM ET</span>",France's Sarkozy convicted of corruption but likely to avoid jail,"By Tangi Salaün
PARIS (Reuters) - Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy was found guilty of corruption on Monday and sentenced to three years in prison, a stunning fall from grace for a man who for five years bestrode the national and global stage.
A Paris court found that Sarkozy, 66, had tried to bribe a judge after leaving office, and to peddle influence in exchange for confidential information about an investigation into his 2007 campaign finances.
""He took advantage of his status and the relationships he had formed,"" presiding judge Christine Mee said.
Sarkozy served as president from 2007 to 2012 and retains influence among conservatives, even after retiring. He is the second head of state in modern-day France to be convicted of corruption.
He may not spend any time in prison, however. Two years of his sentence were suspended, and Mee said she was open to him staying out of prison tagged with an electronic bracelet for the remaining year, although that decision rests with another judge.
The court found that Sarkozy had offered to secure a plum job in Monaco for a judge, Gilbert Azibert, in return for inside information about an inquiry into allegations that he had accepted illegal payments from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt for his 2007 presidential campaign.
Sarkozy left the court without speaking, but his lawyer said he would appeal, and prove his innocence.
""This ruling is extremely severe and wholly unjustified,"" Jacqueline Laffont told reporters.
ANOTHER TRIAL LOOMS
Sarkozy had burst onto the world stage as a reformer full of ideas who wanted to break with France’s stagnant past on the domestic front and restore the birthplace of human rights to a place of prominence in international affairs.
He earned himself the nickname of the ""Gallic Thatcher"", undertaking market-driven reforms such as raising the retirement age, loosening the 35-hour work week and adjusting the tax system to encourage overtime.
Outside France, he brokered a ceasefire to the Russia-Georgia war in 2008, and in 2011 championed a NATO-led military intervention in Libya to support an uprising against its autocratic leader, Muammar Gaddafi.
Investigators had been wiretapping conversations between Sarkozy and his lawyer Thierry Herzog from 2013 as they delved into allegations of Libyan financing of Sarkozy's 2007 campaign.
As they did, they learned that Sarkozy and his lawyer were communicating using mobile phones registered under false names.
Sarkozy said he had become the victim of a witch-hunt by financial prosecutors who had used excessive means to snoop on him.
Herzog and Azibert, who were on trial alongside him, were also found guilty of corruption and influence-peddling.
""Such behaviour can only seriously undermine the legitimate trust that the public must have in the justice system,"" Mee said. 
Sarkozy and his centre-right party Les Republicains have long said the investigations against him are politically motivated.
The only other president of the Fifth Republic to be convicted by a court was Sarkozy's conservative predecessor, the late Jacques Chirac, who was found guilty of corruption in 2011.
Sarkozy is due in court again later this month, on charges of violating campaign financing rules during his failed 2012 re-election bid. 
Prosecutors are also investigating allegations that Gaddafi provided Sarkozy’s 2007 campaign with millions of euros shipped to Paris in suitcases.

Sarkozy denies both allegations.

Police fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse hundreds of protesters in the main city of Yangon on Monday, witnesses said. They later combed through side streets firing rubber bullets and at least one person was hurt, media reported.
In an evening address on state television, army chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing said protest leaders and ""instigators"" would be punished. The army was also investigating financial abuse by the civilian government, he said. 
Suu Kyi, 75, looked in good health during her appearance before a court in the capital Naypyidaw, one of her lawyers said. Two more charges were added to those filed against her after the coup, she said.
""I saw Amay on the video, she looks healthy,"" lawyer Min Min Soe told Reuters, using an affectionate term meaning ""mother"" to refer to Suu Kyi. ""She asked to meet her lawyer.""
The Nobel Peace laureate, who leads the National League for Democracy (NLD), has not been seen in public since her government was toppled and she was detained along with other party leaders.
She was initially charged with illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios. Later, a charge of violating a natural disaster law by breaching coronavirus protocols was added.
On Monday, two more charges were added, one under a section of a colonial-era penal code banning publication of information that may ""cause fear or alarm"", the other under a telecommunications law stipulating licences for equipment, the lawyer said.
The next hearing will be on March 15. Critics of the coup say the charges were trumped up.
'SEVERE ACTION'
Myanmar has been in chaos since the military seized power after alleging fraud in a November election that the NLD won in a landslide, with daily protests getting increasingly violent as police and troops try to stamp them out.
In his speech, read out by a newsreader on state-run MRTV, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing said action would be taken against civil servants refusing to work for the junta. 
He said the military was investigating what he called corruption by the civilian government, accusing the authorities of misusing money meant for COVID-19 prevention efforts.
""The respective ministries are working to find out such financial abuse,"" he said, adding that action would be taken against organizations where foreign currency funds were found. 
He said a committee formed by ousted lawmakers from the civilian government, which has announced the formation of a government-in-exile, was illegal and anyone associated with it would be punished.
The junta has promised a new election but not set a date. 
On Monday, the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, whose name uses the Burmese word for the Myanmar parliament, declared the junta a terrorist group and condemned the violence against protesters as a ""declaration of war on unarmed civilians"".
On Sunday, police fired on crowds in several places, killing 18 people, the United Nations human rights office said. A committee representing lawmakers elected last year said 26 people were killed but Reuters was unable to verify that.
""We have to continue the protest no matter what,"" Thar Nge said after tear gas volleys from the police forced him and others to abandon a barricade in a Yangon street.
The military has not commented on Sunday's violence and police and military spokesmen did not answer calls. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper warned that ""severe action will be inevitably taken"" against ""anarchic mobs"".
Demonstrators marched on Monday in the northwestern town of Kale holding up pictures of Suu Kyi, and live video on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) showed a crowd in the northeastern town of Lashio, chanting slogans. Police and soldiers later raided a church in the town and detained 11 people, a church group said.
After nightfall, a journalist for the Democratic Voice of Burma live-streamed security forces outside his apartment in the coastal town of Myeik, where he had been filming protests. ""They are shooting,"" he cries out, appealing to neighbours for help as sounds of broken glass can be heard and smoke seen. 
It was not clear whether the journalist had been detained.
'ABHORRENT'
The coup brought a halt to Myanmar's tentative steps towards democracy after nearly 50 years of military rule, and has drawn condemnation from the United States and other Western countries, and growing concern among its neighbours.
Foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Myanmar is a member, will hold a video meeting on Myanmar on Tuesday and listen to representatives of the Myanmar military, Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said.
Balakrishnan called for the security forces to desist from the use of lethal force, for Suu Kyi's release, and for talks on solutions and a way back to democratic transition.
Tom Andrews, a U.N. special rapporteur, said it was clear the junta's assault would continue so the international community should ratchet up its response.

He proposed a global arms embargo, more sanctions on those behind the coup and on military businesses and a U.N. Security Council referral to the International Criminal Court.

The armed men took the girls from a boarding school in the increasingly lawless northwestern part of Nigeria early on Feb. 26, the region's second school kidnapping in a week.
Zamfara Information Commissioner Sulaiman Tanau Anka told Reuters via phone that officials knew where the girls were being held and who had them, but would not send in armed security forces for fear of harming the girls. 
Education Commissioner Ibrahim Abdullahi confirmed the talks. 
""Negotiations at high level (are) ongoing and we are hoping for a favourable outcome very soon,"" Abdullahi said.
Zamfara police have worked alongside the army in a search-and-rescue operation since Friday, after the students were taken from the Government Girls Science Secondary School in the town of Jangebe.
Anka added that ""repentant"" bandits who had participated in a state government amnesty programme were serving as interlocutors between the kidnappers and the government. 
""Bandit"" is a catch-all term for groups of armed men who kidnap for ransom, raid villages and russle cattle, rather than for any ideological or political aim. 
On Sunday, two Reuters' correspondents saw a heavy military presence in Zamfara state capital Gusau, with army trucks moving in convoy and police checkpoints on major roads. 

Schools in the region have become targets for mass kidnappings for ransom. Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday urged state governments not to reward bandits with money or vehicles. Zamfara's governor ordered all boarding schools to close immediately after the kidnapping.

1347,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 12:05PM ET</span>","As pandemic eases elsewhere, some Caribbean states face worst outbreaks yet","By Kate Chappell and Sarah Marsh
KINGSTON (Reuters) - In Jamaica, which won praise for containing its coronavirus outbreak last year, patients now overflow into corridors on chairs and stretchers in some hospitals, prompting the Caribbean nation to open three emergency field hospitals.
While global new infections start to decline, a handful of countries across the Caribbean, including the larger islands of Jamaica and Cuba, are suffering their worst outbreaks since the start of the pandemic following social gatherings over year-end, quarantine violations by visitors and growing complacency.
The number of total confirmed cases has almost doubled in the first two months of the year in Jamaica. It has risen around fourfold in Cuba, eightfold in Barbados and around tenfold in St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, according to Oxford University’s Our World in Data database.
In one of the most tourism-dependent regions of the world, authorities have had to reimpose lockdowns and curfews, while reducing flights and hiking quarantine restrictions, further delaying a revival of their fragile economies. 
Some Caribbean nations have started inoculating citizens - thanks, in particular, to an Indian donation of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine - yet broad coverage still looks far off. Cuba is launching late phase trials of two of its own vaccine candidates this month.
""Once the capacity of the health system becomes threatened, we could see a spike not only in the numbers infected but also in those dying from the disease,"" Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness warned in a broadcast address to the nation on Sunday.
The effect of COVID-19 in Caribbean countries has been mixed. In Jamaica, deaths have risen 1.4 times since the end of the year and now stand at 422. Cuba's death toll of 324 is well under the world average per capital - a statistic the government largely puts down to a good healthcare system and experimental treatments - but the number of deaths has doubled there so far in 2021. 
Tiny St Vincent and Grenadines registered its first COVID-19 death this year and has now had eight fatal victims.
While most the Caribbean islands still have adequate hospital capacity to deal with the crisis, in Jamaica, all beds dedicated to COVID-19 isolation were full as of Feb. 26, according to the health ministry.
Holness announced more capacity was being added and lockdown restrictions tightened, including a new stay-at-home order for those aged 60 and above and a ban on access to beaches.
""We are not coping. We are physically and emotionally drained,"" said a nurse who did not want to be named for fear of losing her job. 
SLOW VACCINE ROLLOUT
Caribbean leaders have complained about difficulty accessing vaccines and hoarding by rich nations amid a slow rollout of vaccines by the United Nations-backed COVAX alliance created to ensure poor countries across the world are not left behind.
Jamaica, which has nearly 3 million inhabitants, will receive a donation from India of 50,000 vaccine doses on or before Thursday, Health minister Christopher Tufton said on Sunday at the briefing alongside Holness. 
The island nation should also start receiving its 124,800 doses via the COVAX facility this month, and 1.8 million via the African Medical Supply Platform from April.
But depending on which vaccine is secured, Jamaica still needed to source up to an extra 1.5 million doses to fulfill its aim of inoculating at least 65 % of the population by March 2022, Tufton said.
The prospects for an immediate economic recovery in the face of a slow vaccine roll-out are dim, said Therese Turner-Jones, general manager of the Caribbean Country Department for the Inter-American Development Bank. 
""It's going to be another difficult two years ahead,"" Turner-Jones said. ""Absent a healthy environment, there is not much you are going to do that will get back to business as usual.""
The Caribbean Development Bank said last Thursday it projected growth of 3.8% in its 19 borrowing member countries this year after a contraction of 12.8% last year, with vaccine availability one risk to that forecast.
Still, Cuba could hold a ray of light. It already came through for the Caribbean in terms of sending doctors to neighboring islands throughout the pandemic.
Now, the regional biotech heavyweight says it is already mass producing two of its four vaccine candidates in order to launch late phase trials in March. 

Should its vaccine candidates triumph - becoming the first Latin American homegrown COVID vaccines to be approved - then its neighbors and regional allies could benefit.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide the legality of a decades-old congressional decision to exclude Puerto Rico from a federal program that provides benefits to low-income elderly, blind and disabled people.
The justices took up a U.S. government appeal originally filed by Republican former President Donald Trump's administration of a lower court ruling that found the exclusion unlawful. 
Many Puerto Ricans have long complained that the Caribbean island's residents are treated worse than other Americans despite being U.S. citizens. Puerto Rico, which is not a state, is the most-populous of the U.S. territories, with about 3 million people.
The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year in favor of a Puerto Rican resident named Jose Luis Vaello-Madero who had previously received Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits when he lived in New York but lost eligibility when he moved to Puerto Rico in 2013. 
The 1st Circuit decided that Puerto Rico's exclusion from the program violated a provision of the U.S. Constitution that requires that laws apply equally to everyone.
Vaello-Madero, who is 66 years old and disabled, mounted his constitutional challenge after the government sued him in federal court in Washington in 2017 seeking more than $28,000 for payments it had made to him after he moved to Puerto Rico.
The SSI benefits are available to any U.S. citizen living in any of the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the Northern Mariana Islands, but not the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam.
The decision not to include Puerto Rico was made by Congress when it enacted the program in 1972. The Justice Department, in urging the justices to hear the government's appeal, said the Supreme Court had twice previously upheld the program.
Puerto Ricans are eligible for a different program, called Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled, that allows for more local control but not as much federal funding, the Justice Department said in court papers. 
After Democratic President Joe Biden took office in January, some religious groups urged his administration to drop the appeal. [L1N2KM1J8]
Puerto Rico asked the Supreme Court to uphold the 1st Circuit ruling.
""United States citizens who reside in Puerto Rico enjoy much lesser rights than those who reside in the States merely because of Puerto Rico's status as a territory,"" Puerto Rico's government said in court papers. ""This inequality is both unconstitutional and unacceptable.""

The court is likely to hear and decide the case in its next term, which starts in October and ends in June 2022.

Mumbai police were investigating further after a preliminary report pointed to possible evidence of 14 ""Trojan horse"" programmes incorporated in the city's power system, Anil Deshmukh, a minister for Maharashtra state, told a news conference.
Deshmukh was speaking a day after a New York Times report said that the power outage on October 12 last year was part of a Chinese cyber campaign against India, even as the two countries were locked in a fierce border battle.
A Chinese embassy spokesperson denied the allegations in the New York Times report, in response to request for comment from Reuters.
""Speculation & fabrication have no role to play on the issue of cyber attacks. Highly irresponsible to accuse a particular party with no sufficient evidence around,"" a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in India tweeted late Monday in response to Reuters' request for comments.
Millions were left without power, trains were stranded and online college exams and mobile telephone services collapsed after a grid failure that affected all of Mumbai and lasted for more than 12 hours in some parts of the city.
At the time, local authorities said the failure was caused due to ""technical problems"", but an inquiry was ordered into the incident.
""The preliminary report was handed over to the power ministry. We will investigate it further,"" Deshmukh said at Monday's news conference. 

Relations between nuclear-armed neighbours China and India soured last June when 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed in a Himalayan border fight. Recent talks have eased tension.

OSLO (Reuters) - Some 329 nominations have been received for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, likely reflecting the profusion of pressing human rights issues around the world, the secretary of the committee which awards the prize said on Monday.
""It is the third highest ever total number,"" Norwegian Nobel Committee Secretary Olav Njoelstad told Reuters. The record was 376 candidates, reached in 2016.
Of this year's total, some 234 are for individuals and 95 are for organisations.
""It reflects a lot of international interest in the Nobel Peace Prize,"" he said. ""It probably also reflects that there are a number of unsolved conflicts, wars and human rights problems around the world.""
The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not comment on who is nominated, but nominators, who range from members of parliaments worldwide to former winners, can choose to reveal their picks.
Russia's Alexei Navalny, the World Health Organization and Sweden's Greta Thunberg are among those nominated for this year's award, according to a Reuters survey of Norwegian lawmakers whose nominations have won in recent years.
The COVAX programme to secure fair access to COVID-19 vaccines for poor countries is also named, as is U.S. rights activist Stacey Abrams and Belarusian dissidents Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Maria Kolesnikova and Veronika Tsepkalo.
Reporters without Borders, the International Fact-Checking Network and the Committee to Protect Journalists are nominated too.
Also on the list are former U.S. president Donald Trump, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Kushner's White House deputy, Avi Berkowitz, for their roles in brokering deals normalising relations between Israel and several Arab nations.

The five-strong committee held its first meeting on Friday, Njoelstad said. They will meet roughly once a month to discuss candidates before the 2021 laureate is announced in October.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Top U.N. human rights experts said on Monday that Russia was to blame for attempting to kill Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, and called for an international investigation into his poisoning last year.
The attempt to kill Navalny was part of a pattern of attacks on critics at home and abroad, and intended send a ""sinister warning"" to quash dissent, Agnes Callamard, U.N. special rapporteur on summary killings, and Irene Khan, U.N. expert on freedom of opinion and expression, said in a statement.
""It is our conclusion that Russia is responsible for the attempted poisoning of Mr Navalny,"" Callamard told a news conference, announcing the preliminary findings.
Navalny fell ill in Siberia last August and was flown to Germany, which says it found evidence he had been poisoned with Novichok, a banned nerve agent. 
Russia denies any role in his illness and says it has not seen proof he was poisoned. In a statement, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russia hoped the U.N. rapporteurs' intervention would prompt Germany to release data which Moscow has accused Berlin of withholding.
""We share the interest in finding out the truth of this incident,"" Zakharova said in a statement to Reuters.
After recuperating for five months in Germany, Navalny, 44, returned to Russia in January. He was arrested on arrival and sentenced to 2 1/2 years prison for parole violations.
""Given the inadequate response of the domestic authorities, the use of prohibited chemical weapons, and the apparent pattern of attempted targeted killings, we believe that an international investigation should be carried out as a matter of urgency in order to establish the facts and clarify all the circumstances concerning Mr. Navalny's poisoning,"" the U.N. experts said.
“The use of Novichok violates Russia’s commitments under the Chemical Weapons Convention. It was meant to kill Mr Navalny and as such constitutes a violation of the prohibition against arbitrary killings.""

Callamard and Khan also released the text of a Dec. 30 letter to Russian authorities which said that if allegations were confirmed, Russian officials may be subject to criminal liability for ordering attempted murder.

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 10:50AM ET</span>","Yemenis reel from poverty, hunger as U.N. pleads for funds and war's end","SANAA (Reuters) - Unable to find work, Ahmed Farea has sold everything including his wife's gold to feed and house two young daughters in one small room. 
Elsewhere in Yemen's capital Sanaa, widow Mona Muhammad has work but struggles to buy anything more nutritious than rice for her four children amid high prices.
And in a nearby hospital, severely malnourished children receive lifesaving nutritional drinks. 
Across the country Yemenis are exhausting their coping mechanisms, and children are starving, amid the world's largest humanitarian crisis.
On Monday the United Nations hopes to raise $3.85 billion at a virtual pledging event to avert what the U.N. aid chief has said would be a large-scale ""man-made"" famine, the worst the world will have seen for decades.
""I want the war to stop so we can go back to how we were ... We could buy what we wanted and could feed our children,"" said Muhammad. 
Yemen was a poor country with a child malnutrition problem even before the six-year war disrupted imports, inflated the currency, displaced people, collapsed government services and destroyed incomes. Then COVID-19 hammered remittances from abroad that many families relied on. 
'UNIMAGINABLY CRUEL'
""Since the war and the blockade started, and work stopped, I can't buy anything anymore. Where am I supposed to get it from?"" said Farea, who wheels his barrow daily to collect water in cans from a neighbourhood tank provided for poor people.
""I sleep all morning and then have lunch at noon from whatever God supplies and that covers the rest of the day."" 
His work in construction declined in the wake of the political upheaval caused by Yemen's 2011 uprising, he said. He then sold fruit but rising prices after war broke out in late 2014 made this unprofitable.
As needs have risen in the past year, funding of the aid response has dropped, leading the U.N. and other aid agencies to scale down or close various assistance programmes. 
Famine has never been officially declared in Yemen but pockets of famine-like conditions have appeared for the first time in two years, the U.N. has said. 
In 2018 and 2019, the U.N. prevented famine due to a well-funded aid appeal. But in 2020 the world body only received just over half the $3.4 billion it needed.
""What is happening to the people of Yemen is unimaginably cruel. Aid groups are catastrophically underfunded and overstretched. The parties to this senseless war specialize in producing suffering and the weapon of choice is hunger,"" said Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, on a visit to Yemen. 

There has been a recent renewed push by the U.N. and the United States for a negotiated end to the war, widely seen as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran. New U.S. President Joe Biden has said Yemen is a priority, declaring a halt to U.S. support for the Saudi-led military campaign.

1353,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 09:56AM ET</span>",Refugees' frustration drives renewed Western Sahara conflict,"TINDOUF, Algeria (Reuters) - Generations of young Sahrawis have grown up in Algeria's remote desert refugee camps largely forgotten by the outside world and now see no prospect of an independent homeland in Western Sahara except through a new war their leaders say has already begun.
Their fears that the quest for statehood had become a lost cause grew when U.S. administration of former president Donald Trump recognised Morocco's claims to the vast, sparsely populated territory in December.
""We have not received any peaceful results,"" said Brahim, a Sahrawi man taking part in a recent parade by the group's Polisario Front independence movement in Tindouf, close to Algeria's border with Western Sahara.
""It's why we must return to the armed struggle.""
In November, the movement said it was quitting a three-decade ceasefire with Rabat and has announced frequent attacks since then on Moroccan forces along the desert frontier. 
Morocco has said the Polisario attacks, in remote areas where it is hard to verify either side's claims, have caused it no casualties and done only limited damage. 
The Sahrawi government-in-exile based in Tindouf has called on U.S. President Joe Biden to reverse his predecessor's decision to accept Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. 
""Years of peace have not worked. Now it is time to return to war and we women of Western Sahara will sacrifice our children for the cause,"" said Mbaraka, 65, in the Awserd camp in Tindouf.
The dispute dates to the time when the territory, rich in phosphates and fishing grounds, was a Spanish colony, resisted by the Polisario Front with Algerian backing but also claimed by Morocco. 
When Spain quit in 1975, Moroccan troops marched in and the Polisario, with Algerian support, turned its guns on what it saw as a continuation of colonial rule by a different country. 
Its limited guerrilla successes were curtailed in the 1980s when Morocco built a long sand wall in the desert enclosing about four fifths of the territory within its own control and leaving tens of thousands of refugees on the other side. 
The two agreed a ceasefire in 1991 but, as the conflict froze and negotiations over a permanent settlement stalled, the refugees stayed in the camps. 
Morocco regards the region as part of its territory and is prepared to offer nothing beyond limited autonomy. The Polisario and its government in exile seek independence. 
Tindouf, deep in the Sahara and farther from Algiers than Paris, is home to several camps housing more than 165,000 refugees. They live in windswept concrete or mud shelters with few jobs and little to hope for. 

""The solution is fire and struggle to liberate the land,"" said Mohamed Salem, another Sahrawi man in the parade.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Philip, the 99-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth, was transferred to a different hospital in central London on Monday to have tests for a pre-existing heart condition and receive treatment for an infection.
Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, was admitted to London's private King Edward VII hospital two weeks ago for treatment for an unspecified infection that is not related to COVID-19.
On Monday, Buckingham Palace said he had been moved to St Bartholomew's Hospital, which is a centre of excellence for cardiac care, for further treatment and observation.
""The Duke remains comfortable and is responding to treatment but is expected to remain in hospital until at least the end of the week,"" the palace said in a statement.
Photographers and TV crews at the King Edward hospital had earlier seen a patient being moved into an ambulance, shielded from watching media outside by staff with umbrellas and police, although there was no confirmation this was the prince.
Since being admitted to hospital after feeling unwell on Feb. 16, the duke has been publicly visited only by his son and heir Prince Charles.
The queen, 94, has remained at Windsor Castle west of London, where the couple have been staying during the coronavirus lockdown, and last week continued to carry out her official duties by video. She and Philip have received their first COVID-19 vaccine dose. 
Greek-born Philip, who turns 100 in June, has required hospital treatment a number of times in the last decade for a recurrence of a bladder infection. At Christmas in 2011 he had an operation to clear a blocked artery in his heart after being rushed to hospital with chest pains.
Philip's royal role has been in the spotlight since the start of the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) drama ""The Crown"", which has provided an account of their marriage, Elizabeth's earlier-than-expected inheritance of the British throne, and their family life.

Philip, who has been at the queen's side throughout her 69-year reign, retired from public life in 2017.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Britain, France and Germany are pressing ahead with a U.S.-backed plan for a resolution by the U.N. nuclear watchdog's board criticising Iran for curbing cooperation with the agency, despite Russian and Iranian warnings of serious consequences.
The International Atomic Energy Agency's 35-nation Board of Governors is holding a quarterly meeting this week against the backdrop of faltering efforts to revive Iran's nuclear deal with major powers now that U.S. President Joe Biden is in office.
Iran has recently accelerated its violations of the 2015 deal in an apparent bid to raise pressure on Biden, as each side insists the other must move first. 
Tehran's breaches are a response to the U.S. withdrawal from the deal in 2018 and the reimposition of U.S. sanctions that had been lifted under it.
The latest breach was to scale back cooperation with the IAEA last week, ending extra inspection and monitoring measures introduced by the deal, including the power given to the IAEA to carry out snap inspections at facilities not declared by Iran.
The three European powers, all parties to the 2015 deal, circulated a draft resolution for the Vienna meeting voicing ""serious concern"" at Iran's reduced cooperation and urging Iran to reverse its steps. 
The draft, sent to IAEA board members and obtained by Reuters, also expresses ""deep concern"" at Iran's failure to explain uranium particles found at three old sites, including two that the IAEA first reported on last week.
Iran has bristled at the prospect of such criticism, threatening to cancel a deal struck a week ago with the IAEA to temporarily continue many of the monitoring measures it had decided to end - a black-box-type arrangement valid for up to three months and aimed at creating a window for diplomacy.
Diplomacy, however, is making limited progress. Iran said on Sunday it would not take up a European Union proposal to hold a meeting with other parties to the deal and the United States.
It is unclear how many countries would support a resolution. In a position paper obtained by Reuters before Iran's announcement, Russia warned that a resolution could hurt efforts to revive the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and that it would oppose it.
""Adoption of the resolution will not help the political process of returning to the normal comprehensive implementation of the JCPOA,"" Russia's note to member states said.
""On the contrary it will hugely complicate those efforts undermining the prospects for the restoration of the JCPOA and for normal cooperation between Iran and the Agency.""
Asked about the tussle, IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said he did not want anything to jeopardise his inspectors' work in the Islamic Republic.
""What I hope is that the work of the agency will be preserved. This is essential,"" he told a news conference, before taking an apparent swipe at Iran over its threat.

""The inspection work of the IAEA should not be put in the middle of a negotiating table as a bargaining chip.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Monday appealed for a mystery individual infected with a highly transmissible Brazilian variant of the novel coronavirus to come forward, more than two weeks after they tested positive but failed to give proper contact details.
Britain said six cases had been detected of the ""P.1"" variant identified in the Brazilian city of Manaus, against which current vaccines appear to be less effective. Two were in South Gloucestershire in England and three in Scotland.
But a sixth individual in England, one of more than a million people tested on Feb. 12-13, had yet to be identified.
""If you've had a test on the 12th or 13th of February, (and) haven't had your results back, please get in touch,"" vaccination minister Nadhim Zahawi told Times Radio. ""We are working with the postal system to try and locate them.""
The P.1 variant shares significant mutations with a variant first detected in South Africa known as B.1.351, which has raised similar concerns.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson told broadcasters: ""We don't have any reason at the present time to think that our vaccines are ineffective against these new variants of all types.""
But Adam Finn, of the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, told the BBC: ""The evidence we have suggests that certainly the South African variant and potentially this Brazilian variant, which is somewhat similar - the vaccines we have at the moment are less effective at reducing at least mild disease and possibly transmission. 
""We are optimistic that the vaccines will continue to prevent severe disease, but the evidence for that is still fairly limited.""
Manufacturers are working on measures to adapt their vaccines to mutations of the virus.
Johnson said the government would continue with a ""cautious but irreversible"" relaxing of lockdown restrictions. 
One of the cases in the household in South Gloucestershire had flown from Brazil via Zurich to London, arriving on Feb. 10.
All three Scottish cases were identified as people who had flown from Brazil to Aberdeen via Paris and London and had self-isolated for the required 10 days.

By Sunday, over 20 million people in Britain had been given a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine - just over 30% of the population - while around 800,000 had had a second dose.

""My mission here is to foster and develop this relationship...and we hope this will bring peace and prosperity to the people in the Middle East,"" he said.

China announced the ban last week, citing ""harmful creatures"" it said could come with the fruit, threatening China's own agriculture.
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, says there is nothing wrong with its pineapples and that Beijing is using the fruit as another way to coerce the island.
China's Taiwan Affairs Office said the decision was ""totally rational and necessary"" and that customs had a responsibility to prevent diseases carried by plants from entering the country.
""The Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) authorities have deliberately misrepresented and maliciously interpreted technical issues, taking the opportunity to attack and discredit the mainland,"" it said, referring to Taiwan's ruling party.
The DPP has neither the will nor the ability to solve practical problems, and they can only evade their own responsibility by ""slandering the mainland"", it added.
While Taiwan is best known internationally for exporting semiconductors, the sub-tropical island has a thriving fruit industry developed when it was a Japanese colony, and last year more than 90% of its exported pineapples went to China.
Politicians have rallied behind pineapple farmers, posting pictures of themselves in fields with farmers and tucking into the fruit on their social media pages, encouraging domestic consumers to pick up the slack.
The government has also been asking Taiwanese companies to make bulk purchases, and looking for alternative export markets.
President Tsai Ing-wen on Sunday visited a pineapple farm in southern Taiwan, where the bulk of the fruit is grown and where the DPP traditionally enjoys strong support.

China has ramped up pressure to get Taiwan to accept Chinese sovereignty, including regularly flying fighter jets and bombers near Taiwan or into its air defence identification zone.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A Chinese state-backed hacking group has in recent weeks targeted the IT systems of two Indian vaccine makers whose coronavirus shots are being used in the country's immunisation campaign, cyber intelligence firm Cyfirma told Reuters.
Rivals China and India have both sold or gifted COVID-19 shots to many countries. India produces more than 60% of all vaccines sold in the world.
Goldman Sachs-backed Cyfirma, based in Singapore and Tokyo, said Chinese hacking group APT10, also known as Stone Panda, had identified gaps and vulnerabilities in the IT infrastructure and supply chain software of Bharat Biotech and the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker.
""The real motivation here is actually exfiltrating intellectual property and getting competitive advantage over Indian pharmaceutical companies,"" said Cyfirma Chief Executive Kumar Ritesh, formerly a top cyber official with British foreign intelligence agency MI6.
He said APT10 was actively targeting SII, which is making the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine for many countries and will soon start bulk-manufacturing  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) shots.
""In the case of Serum Institute, they have found a number of their public servers running weak web servers, these are vulnerable web servers,"" Ritesh said, referring to the hackers.
""They have spoken about weak web application, they are also talking about weak content-management system. It's quite alarming.""
China's foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
SII and Bharat Biotech declined to comment. The government-run Indian Computer Emergency Response Team, with whom Cyfirma said it had shared its findings, had no immediate comment.
The U.S. Department of Justice said in 2018 that APT10 had acted in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security. (https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/11/13/health-care-cyberattacks-covid-19-paris-peace-forum in November that it had detected cyber attacks from Russia and North Korea targeting COVID-19 vaccine companies in India, Canada, France, South Korea and the United States. North Korean hackers also tried to break into the systems of British drugmaker AstraZeneca, Reuters https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-coronavirus-astrazeneca-no-idUSKBN2871A2 has reported.
Ritesh, whose firm follows the activities of some 750 cyber criminals and monitors nearly 2,000 hacking campaigns using a tool called decipher, said it was not yet clear what vaccine-related information APT10 may have accessed from the Indian companies.
Bharat Biotech's COVAXIN shot, developed with the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research, will be exported to many countries, including Brazil.
U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and its German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) said in December that documents related to development of their COVID-19 vaccine had been ""unlawfully accessed"" in a cyberattack on Europe's medicines regulator.

After a long campaign that was derailed in the latter stages by a Trump administration veto, the 66-year-old Nigerian was confirmed as boss last month, pledging to ""forget business as usual"" at the body which is struggling to strike new deals and whose arbitration functions are paralysed. [L1N2KL1GE]
""It feels great. I am coming into one of the most important institutions in the world and we have a lot of work to do. I feel ready to go,"" Okonjo-Iweala told a reporter on arrival at the WTO's lakeside Geneva headquarters.
The first day with the former finance and foreign minister at the helm of the WTO coincides with a meeting of its top decision-making body, the General Council. Its 164 member states will discuss topics such as trade rules on COVID-19 vaccine distribution which Okonjo-Iweala has identified as a priority.
Also on the agenda is the date and venue for its major ministerial conference which was due to be held in Kazakhstan last year but was delayed by the pandemic. 
Okonjo-Iweala said she was hopeful of clinching a deal on cutting fisheries subsidies this year after 20 years of talks.
""Things are not easy when members are negotiating and there are still a lot of critical issues that need to be sorted out. But we are hopeful,"" she said, speaking next to an ice statue of fish erected by environmental groups outside the WTO.
Her predecessor, Brazilian Roberto Azevedo, stepped down on Aug. 31, a year early. 

Since the director-general role holds few executive powers, some analysts question Okonjo-Iweala's ability to revive the body in the face of so many challenges including persistent U.S.-China trade tensions and growing protectionism heightened by the pandemic.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said on Monday the United States should lift sanctions first if it wants to hold talks with Tehran to salvage the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that former President Donald Trump abandoned.
President Joe Biden has said Washington is ready for talks about both nations resuming compliance with the pact, under which Tehran secured an easing of sanctions by limiting its nuclear work. But each side wants the other to move first.
The West fears Iran wants to build nuclear weapons, while Tehran says that has never been its goal.
""President Joe Biden's administration should change Trump's maximum pressure policy towards Tehran ... If they want talks with Iran, first they should lift sanctions,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said.
Washington said on Sunday it was disappointed by Tehran's refusal to hold talks but was ready to ""re-engage in meaningful diplomacy"" and would consult with major powers.
While Iran has been demanding the lifting of U.S. sanctions first, Washington says Tehran must return to compliance with the deal, which Iran has been progressively breaching since 2019.
""The new U.S. administration's refusal to return to the deal is a historic mistake,"" Khatibzadeh said, saying Tehran would continue to work with the U.N. nuclear watchdog despite scaling back cooperation.
Iran's foreign minister urged the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) 35-nation Board of Governors not to ""create a mess"" by endorse a U.S.-led push to adopt a resolution against Tehran's decision to scale back its cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog. 
""Europeans, with the backing of the United States, have initiated a wrong path in the IAEA's board ... we believe this move will lead to a mess,"" Iranian media quoted Mohammad Javad Zarif as saying on Monday. ""We have solutions for all scenarios."" 
In a position paper seen by Reuters and sent to other IAEA member states before the board's quarterly meeting this week, Tehran threatens to end a deal struck with the IAEA a week ago temporarily maintaining some monitoring of its activities. 

However, diplomats said it was unclear whether the board would adopt a resolution.

It said the U.S. diplomats would also visit other regional capitals as part of a mission aimed at working toward ""a just and durable political settlement and permanent and comprehensive ceasefire"".
It did not provide dates or other details of where they intended to go, though Pakistan is a neighbour with keen interest in how the Afghan conflict plays out.
On Monday, Khalilzad discussed the peace process with Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of Afghanistan's High Council for National Reconciliation, and he was also expected to meet other Afghan officials.
""Development of the peace process, accelerating the process and the assessment of the Doha peace agreement by the U.S. new administration were main topics of the discussion,"" said Fraidoon Khwazoon, a spokesman for Abdullah.
President Joe Biden's administration is conducting a review of a February 2020 deal struck between the Trump administration and the Taliban to determine whether to stick by a deadline to withdraw the remaining 2,500 U.S. troops from Afghanistan, and end America's longest war.
The Taliban's deputy leader Sirajuddin Haqqani made a speech on Friday, broadcast on the group's media channel with excerpts posted on Twitter, warning the United States against going back on a commitment to withdraw.
""Today ....we have the technology to use drones, we have our own missiles. This time if the Mujahideen resume fighting the enemies, it would be something they have never seen before. They will wish the battlefield was like in the past,"" he said, referring to Taliban fighters.
U.S. and European officials have said the Taliban has not fulfilled commitments it made in an accord reached with the United States in Doha a year ago, that set up the move towards peace talks involving the Afghan government.

The Taliban has largely denied responsibility for a rash of attacks in Afghanistan since beginning talks with the government in September.

Investigators suspect a police major in St Petersburg of accessing an official database and selling air passenger data of a flight from the Siberian city of Tomsk to Moscow last August that Navalny was on board the day he was poisoned. 
Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, collapsed on the flight in a near-fatal poisoning in Siberia with what many Western nations said was a nerve agent. 
The policeman, who was not named in Kommersant's article, is suspected of abuse of power, which carries a punishment of up to ten years in jail. It did not say if anyone had been arrested.
Citing flight records and other data, investigative website Bellingcat and media outlet The Insider said in December that they had identified assassins from Russia's FSB security service as Navalny's would-be killers.
The criminal investigation against the St Petersburg policeman is at least the second such case reported by Russian media. 
In January, the RBC business daily reported that a police officer in the city of Samara had been put under house arrest on the same charge for leaking other confidential information that could have helped identify Navalny's alleged poisoners.

Navalny accuses Putin of ordering his murder. The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected any suggestion that Russian authorities tried to kill him.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Protest slogans rang out as about 1,000 people gathered outside a Hong Kong court on Monday for the hearing of 47 democracy activists charged with conspiracy to commit subversion, as authorities intensify a crackdown on the opposition.
Security was tight, with more than 100 police officers deployed outside the West Kowloon court, in the largest rally this year despite social-distancing rules to curb the spread of coronavirus. 
The activists are accused of organising and participating in an unofficial primary poll last July aimed at selecting the strongest candidates for a legislative council election that the government later postponed, citing the coronavirus. 
Authorities said the informal poll was part of a plan to ""overthrow"" the government, further raising alarm that Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn since Beijing imposed a national security law on its freest city last June.
""This is the most ridiculous arrest in the history of Hong Kong,"" said Herbert Chow, 57, who was queuing outside the court and wearing a black face mask. ""But I have confidence in our judicial system to restore justice. It’s the last line of defence."" 
Many were dressed in black, the colour associated with the 2019 anti-government protests, while some chanted: ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"" and ""Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,"" popular slogans during the unrest. 
Others raised the three-finger salute that has become the symbol of protest against authoritarian rule in Myanmar. 
The activists - 39 men and eight women, ages 23-64 - were charged on Sunday under the national security law, which punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
The queue to enter the court stretched several hundred metres, nearly reaching around the entire block.
'FULL FAITH'
Several foreign diplomats also queued. 
Jonathan Williams (NYSE:WMB), a British diplomat at the U.K. consulate in the city, said: ""It’s clear that the use of the national security law is going much broader than the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities promised."" 
He added, however, that the UK government had ""full faith in the independent judiciary,"" to deal with the defendants fairly and impartially without political pressure.
As crowds swelled outside the court building, some held up large yellow banners that said: ""Release all political prisoners now.""
Authorities have said that campaigning to win a majority in Hong Kong's 70-seat Legislative Council, with the purpose of blocking government proposals to ramp up pressure for democratic reforms, could be seen as subversive.
Among those charged were the organiser of the primary election and former law professor Benny Tai, as well as prominent activists Lester Shum, Joshua Wong and Owen Chow.
The charges are the latest blow to the city's pro-democracy movement. Since the security legislation was imposed on the city last June, some elected legislators have been disqualified, scores of activists arrested and others have fled overseas. 
The crackdown on dissent comes as Chinese officials prepare to unveil electoral reforms that will most likely further diminish the role and influence of opposition forces in public office.
As Beijing consolidates its hold over Hong Kong, concern is mounting in the West over freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and which underpin its role as a global financial centre.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for the 47 to be released immediately.
""Political participation and freedom of expression should not be crimes,"" Blinken said on Twitter. ""The U.S. stands with the people of Hong Kong.""

On Sunday, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described the charges as ""deeply disturbing.""

For the third year in a row, no journalists told the group that working conditions had improved, the FCCC said in an annual report based on 150 responses to a survey of correspondents and interviews with bureau chiefs.
""All arms of state power - including surveillance systems introduced to curb coronavirus - were used to harass and intimidate journalists, their Chinese colleagues, and those whom the foreign press sought to interview,"" it said.
Authorities cited public health concerns to deny reporters access to sensitive areas and threatened them with enforced quarantine, it added. Visa (NYSE:V) restrictions were also used to put pressure on reporting.
At least 13 correspondents were given press credentials valid for 6 months or less, the FCCC said. Foreign reporters based in China typically receive one-year visas and must renew them annually.
Journalists were also used as ""pawns"" in China's diplomatic disputes, it added.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Monday that the report's claims were ""baseless"".
""We always welcome media and journalists from all countries to cover news in China according to the law ... what we oppose is ideological bias against China and fake news in the name of press freedom,"" he said, at a daily news briefing.
China expelled more than a dozen foreign journalists at U.S. media organizations in 2020, amid a series of tit-for-tat actions between the countries. Washington also slashed the number of journalists permitted to work in the United States at four major Chinese state-owned media outlets.
In September, Australia helped two of its foreign correspondents leave China after they were questioned by the country's state security ministry.
Journalists reporting from far western Xinjiang, where China has been accused of large-scale human rights abuses, encountered especially intense harassment, the report said. 
Last year Chinese authorities detained Cheng Lei, an Australian citizen working for Chinese state media, and later Haze Fan, a Chinese national working for Bloomberg News, both on suspicion of endangering national security.
Both remain in detention.

Some Reuters journalists are members of the FCCC.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Iran on Monday for an explosion aboard an Israeli-owned ship in the Gulf of Oman last week, an accusation rejected by Tehran.
The vehicle-carrier MV Helios Ray was hit between Thursday night and Friday morning by a blast above the water line that a U.S official said ripped holes in both sides of its hull. An Israeli official said limpet mines were used. 
""This was indeed an operation by Iran. That is clear,"" Netanyahu told Kan radio. 
Asked if Israel would retaliate, he said: ""You know my policy. Iran is Israel's biggest enemy. I am determined to fend it off. We are striking at it all over the region.""
Iran denied involvement. ""We strongly reject this accusation,"" Saeed Khatibzadeh, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Tehran, told a news conference. ""The security of the Persian Gulf is extremely important for Iran."" 
Kan said the Netanyahu interview was pre-recorded on Sunday night, before Syria accused Israel of carrying out missile strikes around southern Damascus. 
Israel did not confirm carrying out those strikes, but has previously said it was launching frequent military actions against Iranian deployment or arms handovers within Syria.
Yoav Galant, a minister in Netanyahu's security cabinet and a former navy admiral, said pictures of the Helios Ray showed each hole resulted from ""a mine affixed to the exterior, apparently in a nighttime navy commando operation"".
The perpetrators would have known about the ship's Israeli ownership from open-source material, and the incident took place close to Iranian-controlled coastline, Galant told Ynet TV - adding that a formal investigation had confirmed his observations.
Iran said in November it would make a ""calculated"" response to the killing of its top nuclear scientist, which it blamed on Israel. Israel has not responded to that accusation. 

Tensions have risen in the Gulf region since the United States reimposed sanctions on Iran in 2018 after then-president Donald Trump withdrew Washington from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major powers.

Police also used tear gas and water cannon against protesters who marched on a military base in Bangkok, calling for King Maha Vajiralongkorn to give up direct command of the army unit housed there.
Protesters threw bottles at police near barricades.
""It was the first time rubber bullets were used,"" Bangkok police chief Pakapong Pongpetra told reporters on Monday, claiming their use had been necessary to prevent the violence from escalating. 
The youth-led political movement is demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and has broken taboos by calling for reform of the powerful monarchy.
The Royal Palace has declined to directly comment on the protests.
Police said 22 protesters were arrested on Sunday and charged with violating an emergency decree, enforced since last year to curb the spread of COVID-19, and for obstructing authorities. 
Ten protesters and 26 police officers were injured in the clash, Bangkok's Erawan Emergency Medical Centre said in a statement. 
A Thai government spokesman said a police officer had also died due to a heart attack.
Prayuth said tougher measures had been employed because protesters initiated violence. 
""Police had to use measures according to international standards,"" he told reporters at the Government House on Monday. 
Jutatip Sirikhan, a prominent Thai protester, denied that protesters started the violence.
""The violence only started when authorities cracked down on protesters,"" she told Reuters.

""Police should be facilitating people's political expression, not firing bullets at them.""

Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who wrote opinion columns for the Washington Post criticising Saudi policies, was killed and dismembered by a team linked to the crown prince in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. 
A U.S. intelligence report on Friday found the prince had approved the killing, and Washington imposed sanctions on some of those involved - but not Prince Mohammed himself. The Saudi government, which has denied any involvement by the crown prince, rejected the report's findings.
""It is essential that the crown prince... should be punished without delay,"" Hatice Cengiz said on Twitter. ""If the crown prince is not punished, it will forever signal that the main culprit can get away with murder which will endanger us all and be a stain on our humanity.""
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration on Friday imposed a visa ban on some Saudis believed involved in the Khashoggi killing and placed sanctions on others that would freeze their U.S. assets and generally bar Americans from dealing with them.
Asked about criticism of Washington for not sanctioning Prince Mohammed directly, Biden said an announcement would be made on Monday, but did not provide details, while a White House official suggested no new steps were expected.

""Starting with the Biden administration, it is vital for all world leaders to ask themselves if they are prepared to shake hands with a person whose culpability as a murderer has been proven,"" Cengiz said.

KOLKATA, India (Reuters) - Human Rights Watch and Rohingya Muslim refugees in India urged the government on Monday to provide refuge to 81 Rohingya people whose boat has been drifting in the Andaman Sea for over two weeks.
Since last month, India has been providing food, medical and technical aid to Rohingya crammed on a fishing boat that was found drifting in international waters after it left southern Bangladesh. The Rohingya had hoped to reach Malaysia but the boat's engine developed technical snags.
Eight people on board the boat have died and many of the 81 survivors are sick and suffering from extreme dehydration, having run out of food and water four days into their journey. 
India's coast guard has repaired the vessel but was not permitting it to enter Indian waters, and instead wanted it to return to Bangladesh. 
""We are begging Indian authorities to bring our people to land, how can all countries refuse to accept 81 lives stranded in international waters?"" said Sabber Kyaw Min, director of Rohingya Human Rights Initiative (RHRI) in India.
""Eight are already dead, we have a right to receive their bodies,"" Min said adding he and about 16,000 Rohingya refugees living in India were urging the government to accept the distressed refugees.
Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said India should uphold its obligations under international law and protect the refugees.
""The Rohingya have been so persecuted, and for so long, they are desperate to find a place where they can be safe and made to feel welcome. And yet, no country in the world, even those that sympathise with them, are willing,"" Ganguly said.
India's foreign ministry did not respond to questions on whether the 81 Rohingya will be allowed to enter India, and neither did it provide an update on talks with Bangladesh on the issue. 
New Delhi has not signed the 1951 Refugee Convention, which spells out refugee rights and state responsibilities to protect them and nor does it have a law protecting refugees.
But Bangladesh foreign minister A.K. Abdul Momen last week told Reuters that his government expects India, the closest country, or Myanmar, the Rohingyas' country of origin, to accept the 81 survivors.
More than 1 million Rohingya refugees from Buddhist-majority Myanmar are living in teeming camps in predominantly Muslim Bangladesh. Many of them fled their country after Myanmar's military conducted a deadly crackdown in 2017.
Myanmar doesn't recognise the Rohingya as an ethnic group and insists that they are Bangladeshi migrants living illegally in the country.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday an unidentified cabinet minister accused of rape has ""vigorously rejected"" the allegation during talks with him.
Several opposition lawmakers said late last week they received a letter detailing an allegation of rape by a male cabinet minister before he entered parliament. 
Morrison said his office also received a letter detailing the allegation.
Australia's Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said earlier on Monday the alleged crime had been referred to Australian Federal Police for a fresh investigation. A previous investigation by New South Wales police was suspended after the alleged victim committed suicide last year.
According to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, the rape happened in Sydney in 1988. 
""The individual involved here has vigorously rejected these allegations. And so, it's a matter for the police,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney.
Australian Federal Police confirmed they had received the complaint but declined any further comment.
Morrison said the minister would keep his cabinet position, pending the outcome of the police investigation.
Opposition lawmakers have called on Morrison to suspend the minister pending an investigation.
The allegation comes as Morrison's government is under public pressure after three former staff members of his ruling Liberal party said they had been raped by an unidentified colleague.
One victim who went public with her allegations has made an official police complaint.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Rockets have hit Iraqi cities and COVID-19 has flared,yet, barring last-minute changes, Pope Francis will embark on a whirlwind four-day trip starting on Friday to show solidarity with the country's devastated Christian community.
Keen to get on the road again after the pandemic put paid to several planned trips, he convinced some perplexed Vatican aides that it is worth the risk and that, in any case, his mind was made up, three Vatican sources said.
""He is itching to get back out on the road after such a long period,"" said one Vatican official. ""Despite some misgivings, the general mood in here is that all systems are go.""
The March 5-8 trip will be Francis' first outside Italy since November 2019, when he visited Thailand and Japan. Four trips planned for 2020 were cancelled because of COVID-19.
""He really feels that need to reach out to people on their home ground,"" said the official, a Vatican prelate who is familiar with Iraq and who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Vatican officials and local Church leaders say they are satisfied that Iraqi forces will be able to provide adequate security for the pope and his entourage.
""The pope knows where he is going. He is deliberately coming to an area marked by war and violence to bring a message of peace,"" Archbishop Bashar Warda of Erbil told reporters on a recent conference call.
""The authorities are taking the pope's security very seriously, with 10,000 security personnel deployed for the purpose,"" he said.
TRIP ELUDED OTHER POPES
Conflict in Iraq, birthplace of the Prophet Abraham - who is revered by Christians, Muslims and Jews - made a trip by Francis' predecessors elusive.
But while wars have ended, violence continues.
A twin suicide attack in Baghdad killed at least 32 people in January. The pope condemned the bombings.
Last Monday, rockets hit Baghdad's fortified Green Zone, which hosts government buildings and foreign embassies. There were no casualties.
Another shadow hanging over the trip is the coronavirus pandemic, which, along with security measures, will drastically limit the number of people who will see the pope in person.
Officials banned most travel within provinces after more than 4,000 new cases were detected on Thursday, for a total of more than 600,000 cases so far.
Francis, 84, has said it is important to make the trip even if most Iraqi Christians will see him only on television.
""They will see the pope is there in their country,"" he told Catholic News Service last month, adding: ""I am the pastor of people who are suffering,""
Several Vatican and Iraqi Church officials say they are doing everything possible to ensure that papal appearances do not turn out to be super-spreader events.
The pope and his entourage, including the accompanying press corps, have been vaccinated. But most people who will attend papal events have not. A first batch of 50,000 doses is due to arrive in Iraq from China on Monday.
SOCIALLY DISTANCED GATHERINGS
Two gatherings at churches in Baghdad will be limited to about 100 people each, with social distancing and masks required.
Up to 10,000 people will have numbered seats for a papal Mass in a stadium in Erbil that has a capacity of 30,000, and contact tracing will be possible if there is an outbreak, Warda said.
Vatican and Iraqi planners of the trip got a sobering reminder of the spread of coronavirus in Iraq on Saturday when Archbishop Mitja Leskovar, the Vatican's ambassador there, said he had tested positive and had gone into self-isolation.
Leskovar has been the key planner of the trip and he had been due to be at the pope's side throughout the visit.
""This is not going to influence the pope’s program, which is going on as planned,"" Leskovar told Reuters.

For security reasons and so as not to draw crowds, the pope will use a closed car and not a popemobile on the streets, a Vatican source said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tepco, the operator of Japan's wrecked Fukushima atomic plant, said it had successfully removed spent uranium fuel from a damaged reactor building in a key step in its clean up of the site after a nuclear disaster a decade ago.
Formally known as Tokyo Electric Power, Tepco said it had transferred around 170 tonnes of spent uranium fuel from high up in the building to a safer location -- the second successful operation of its kind and the first to be carried out by remote control, due to the high radiation in the reactor building.
It comes as Japan prepares to mark the tenth anniversary of the March 11, 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disasters. It will provide Tepco with important experience and data for the much tougher and time consuming task of extracting melted reactor cores and debris in the coming decades.
At 13:59 local time (0459 GMT) on Sunday the last six of 566 used fuel assemblies were removed from the spent fuel pool by a crane operated by a team located about 500 metres (550 yards) away, Tepco said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Monday.
The transfer from the No. 3 building started in April 2019 following the safe removal of more than 1,300 fuel rods from the badly damaged reactor No. 4 building in 2014. 
The work on the No. 3 unit required the removal of huge pieces of damaged equipment that fell into the pool during the explosions that rocked the nuclear site in Fukushima, in the days after an earthquake and tsunami knocked out power and emergency cooling.
Three overheated reactors melted down in the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.
In the decade since, Tepco has had to contend with huge amounts of contaminated water building up at the site due to the nature of its ad hoc cooling system used to keep the melted fuel in a safe state. 

The utility has also been criticised by regulators on multiple occasions for safety breaches and other failings.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China, under growing global pressure over its treatment of a Muslim minority in its far west, is mounting an unprecedented and aggressive campaign to push back, including explicit attacks on women who have made claims of abuse.
As allegations of human rights violations in Xinjiang mount, with a growing number of Western lawmakers accusing China of genocide, Beijing is focussing on discrediting the female Uighur witnesses behind recent reports of abuse.
Chinese officials have named women, disclosed what they say is private medical data and information on the women's fertility, and accused some of having affairs and one of having a sexually transmitted disease. The officials said the information was evidence of bad character, invalidating the women's accounts of abuse in Xinjiang.
""To rebuke some media's disgusting acts, we have taken a series of measures,"" Xu Guixiang, the deputy head of Xinjiang's publicity department, told a December news conference that was part of China's pushback campaign. It includes hours-long briefings, with footage of Xinjiang residents and family members reading monologues.
A Reuters review of dozens of hours of presentations from recent months and hundreds of pages of literature, as well as interviews with experts, shows a meticulous and wide-reaching campaign that hints at China's fears that it is losing control of the Xinjiang narrative.
""One reason that the Communist Party is so concerned about these testimonies from women is because it undermines their initial premise for what they're doing there, which is anti-terrorism"", said James Millward, a professor of Chinese history at Georgetown University and expert in Xinjiang policy.
""The fact that there are so many women in the camps ... who don't have the faintest appearance of being violent people, this just shows how this has nothing to do with terrorism.""
Uighurs make up most of the 1 million people that a United Nations estimate says have been detained in Xinjiang camps under what the central government calls a campaign against terrorism. Accusations by activists and some Western politicians include torture, forced labour and sterilisations. 
In rare U.S. bipartisan agreement, the top diplomats of the former administration of Donald Trump and the new one of Joe Biden have called China's treatment of the Uighurs genocide, a stance adopted last week by the Canadian and Dutch parliaments. 
China faces sanctions such as a ban on U.S purchases of Xinjiang cotton and tomatoes, and calls by some Western lawmakers to boycott the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. The government denies accusations of abuse at the ""vocational training centres"" in the remote western region, and says claims of systematic sexual abuse are unfounded.
Beijing has rejected calls for an independent U.N. investigation into Xinjiang's internment program. Journalists and diplomats have not been permitted access to the camps outside of tightly controlled government tours. Uighurs in Xinjiang have told Reuters they fear reprisals for speaking to press while in China
'LIES AND SLANDER'
China's tightly controlled, invitation-only media events on Xinjiang require journalists to submit questions days or weeks in advance. They include pre-recorded videos and prepared testimony by former camp inmates and religious figures.
Beijing has packaged content from the events in two volumes titled, ""The Truth About Xinjiang: Exposing the US-Led Lies and Slanders About Xinjiang.""
In January, the Twitter account of China's U.S. embassy was suspended for a tweet that said Uighur women had been ""baby-making machines"" before Beijing instituted its system of camps.
""The biological, the reproductive, the gendered aspect of this is particularly horrifying to the world,"" said Georgetown's Millward. China ""seems to have recognised that... You now see them trying in this clumsy way to respond.""
During a regular daily press briefing last week, foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin held up images of witnesses who had described sexual abuse in Xinjiang. The account of one of them, he said, was ""lies and rumours"" because she had not recounted the experience in previous interviews. He gave medical details about the woman's fertility.
Xinjiang officials in January said a woman who had spoken to foreign media had syphilis, and they showed images of medical records - unsolicited information that was not directly related to her account.
A Xinjiang government official said of another witness last month: ""Everyone knows about her inferior character. She's lazy and likes comfort, her private life is chaotic, her neighbours say that she committed adultery while in China.""
Last week, the top spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry, Hua Chunying, tweeted images of four named witnesses, saying they had ""raked their brains for lies"", adding ""they will never succeed.""

China has declined to provide data on the number of people in the camps. Beijing initially denied the camps existed but now says they are vocational and education centres and that all the people have ""graduated"".

People above 60, and those who are 45 or more and suffering from certain medical conditions, are now eligible for the vaccinations.
India, which has reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world after the United States, has so far vaccinated more than 12 million health and front-line workers.
""Remarkable how our doctors and scientists have worked in quick time to strengthen the global fight against COVID-19,"" Modi said on Twitter, posting a picture of him getting the shot at a government hospital in New Delhi.
""I appeal to all those who are eligible to take the vaccine. Together, let us make India COVID-19 free!""
The government said last week it would let people choose their vaccination centres, effectively letting beneficiaries pick either the home-grown COVAXIN shot or the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine, unlike earlier.
The inoculation campaign has progressed slower than expected due to a reluctance of health and front-line workers to take COVAXIN, which was approved without late-stage efficacy data. Only about 11% of vaccinated people have opted for the product developed by Bharat Biotech and the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research.
Bharat Biotech has said efficacy data from a late-stage trial on nearly 26,000 volunteers who took COVAXIN will be out soon. The company, along with India's drug regulator, says COVAXIN is safe and effective, based on early and intermediate studies.

India has reported more than 11 million coronavirus infections and over 157,000 deaths.

More than 30 other people were wounded when soldiers and police fired live ammunition into crowds in six cities across Myanmar on Sunday, UN Human Rights Office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said in a statement. Myanmar’s government said 12 people died.
The U.S., which has announced sanctions targeting Myanmar’s military leaders and called for a return to democracy, signaled that it plans to respond with further measures.
“To that end, we are preparing additional actions to impose further costs on those responsible for this latest outbreak of violence and the recent coup,” Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, said in a statement. “We will have more to share in the coming days.”
The rising death toll may increase pressure on governments around the world to take more action against Myanmar’s generals, who refused to recognize a landslide election victory by Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party in November. A court in Myanmar’s capital Naypyidaw is set to hear cases against Suu Kyi and former President Win Myint later on Monday, Mizzima News reported.
“In shooting against unarmed citizens, the security forces have shown a blatant disregard for international law, and must be held to account,” said Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs. “Violence will not give legitimacy to the illegal over-throwing of the democratically-elected government.”
Prior to this weekend, only three protesters had died among hundreds of thousands that have protested almost daily across the country. Yet the country has become increasingly ungovernable as more people join the protest movement, leaving hospitals understaffed, containers stacking up at ports and bank ATMs running out of cash.
The Myanmar Police Force said that 571 protesters had been detained in 11 provinces on Sunday, after the UN Human Rights Office said more than 1,000 people had been “arbitrarily arrested” since the coup.
On Sunday night, Myanmar’s Foreign Ministry repeated that the military takeover was constitutional and said some foreign countries were “wrongly misinterpreting it as a coup and anti-dictatorship protests.” It added that the government was “ensuring minimal use of force by avoiding a violent crackdown.”
With the mass civil disobedience movement disrupting normal banking operations, the Central Bank of Myanmar began limiting cash withdrawals on Monday. Individuals will not be allowed to withdraw more than 2 million kyat ($1,406) from their bank accounts while businesses will be allowed to withdraw up to 20 million kyat a week, according to a directive signed by central bank Deputy Governor Than Than Swe.
The protests and work stoppages also took a toll on industrial activity in the country, with the purchasing managers’ index for manufacturers plunging more than 20 points to a record low of 27.7 in February, IHS Markit said Monday. That’s well below the 50 level that divides between expansion and contraction territory.
The junta fired Myanmar’s UN envoy Kyaw Moe Tun on Saturday after he urged the international community a day earlier not to accept the military regime and instead recognize the results of the November general election.
Parallel Government
Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy plans to put together a parallel government that could engage with the international community, the Financial Times reported, citing a party official who is on the run.
How Myanmar Coup Puts Democracy on Back Burner Again: QuickTake
Southeast Asian foreign ministers are making arrangements to meet this week to discuss the situation, Japan’s Kyodo news agency reported on Saturday. It said most members of the 10-nation group have expressed a willingness to join, and Myanmar has been asked to participate, according to Kyodo.
Five journalists were arrested on Saturday for reporting on anti-coup protests, according to Myanmar Journalists Network. One of them is reported to be a photojournalist with the Associated Press, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a rights group.
Myanmar’s violent crackdown is “outrageous and unacceptable, and must be immediately halted,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch. “Live ammunition should not be used to control or disperse protests and lethal force can only be used to protect life or prevent serious injury.”

1377,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2021 10:55PM ET</span>","South Korea's Moon says Olympics may be chance for North Korea, U.S. talks","By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said on Monday that the Tokyo Olympics could provide a chance to reopen talks between North Korea and the United States, North Korea and Japan, and the two Koreas. 
Speaking at a ceremony marking the 102nd anniversary of the March 1 Independence Movement Day in Seoul, Moon also said South Korea will work with Japan for the success of the Tokyo Olympics, which could help the two countries recover from the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Moon's speech came as North Korea's relations with South Korea and Japan have soured after its denuclearisation negotiations with the United States fell apart in 2019. 
Seeking to take a page from its 2018 Winter Olympics, Seoul is pinning high hopes on the Tokyo Olympics to revitalise diplomacy with North Korea despite uncertainty over the coronavirus pandemic and Pyongyang's cutoff of exchanges with the outside world. 
""The Games scheduled for this year may serve as an opportunity for dialogue between South Korea and Japan, South and North Korea, North Korea and Japan, and North Korea and the United States,"" Moon said at a public park in Seoul where independence fighters declared the country's freedom in 1919 from Japanese colonial rule. 
""I hope that both Korea and Japan will be able to revive our economies, which were hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, and jointly create a new order in the post-COIVD-19 era."" 
Japan's 1910-45 colonisation of the Korean peninsula continues to dog bilateral ties. 
In January, a Seoul court for the first time ordered Japan to compensate 12 former ""comfort women"" who were forced to work in its wartime brothels, following a 2018 ruling by South Korea's Supreme Court that two Japanese firms should compensate some wartime forced labourers.
Both rulings drew a rebuke from Tokyo, which says the women and labour issues were settled under a 2015 deal and 1965 treaty, respectively. 
Moon said he was ""ready to sit down"" for talks with Japanese officials on those issues while seeking ""wise solutions based on a victim-centred approach."" 

""We must not let the past hold us back,"" he said. ""I am confident that if we put our heads together ... we will also be able to wisely resolve issues of the past.""

OAKLAND, Calif./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. national security commission is recommending that American universities take steps to prevent sensitive technology from being stolen by the Chinese military, a sign of growing concerns over the security of academic research.
The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), led by former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) chairman Eric Schmidt, is set to vote Monday on its final report to Congress. A new section on university research was added to a recently published final draft, which also features numerous recommendations in areas including competition in artificial intelligence and the semiconductor supply chain.
The fresh recommendations come as the United States pushes ahead with the prosecution of at least five Chinese researchers arrested last year in various cities across the U.S. on charges of visa fraud for not disclosing ties to the Chinese military.
Among those arrested was Chen Song, a former Stanford University visiting scholar in neurology who faces charges including obstruction of justice, destruction of records, and making false statements to a government agency. She pleaded not guilty at an arraignment last week in the United States District Court Northern District of California.
""Dr. Song is a physician. She was here to do medical research that would have benefited stroke victims in the United States had she been allowed to complete her work,"" her lawyer, Ed Swanson, said in an e-mail. 
Other cases involve Juan Tang, a visiting researcher at UC Davis School of Medicine; Xin Wang a visiting researcher at UC San Francisco who was working on projects related to metabolism and obesity; Kaikai Zhao a PhD student studying AI and machine learning at Indiana University in Bloomington; and Lei Guan, who worked as a researcher at UCLA's mathematics department.
Stanford, UCSF, and UC Davis all said they are cooperating with the authorities on the investigations. University of Indiana did not reply to request for comment and UCLA was not immediately available.
China has denied allegations it was trying to steal U.S. research.
The cases are part of the U.S. Department of Justice's so-called ""China initiative"" launched in 2018 to counter China’s national security threats.
The NSCAI recommendations would require more disclosure on research funding and partnerships at universities. It also proposes creating a database of individuals and entities to flag risks in advance.
Gilman Louie, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and NSCAI commissioner, said a database could help avoid unilateral bans based on affiliations and instead allow the U.S. to judge individual cases. Louie said the commission wanted to avoid a ""sledgehammer approach."" 
The lack of guidance so far has meant that some nervous university presidents have kept Chinese nationals away from any research projects, said Louie. ""That somebody simply looks at you and determines because you're ethnically Chinese that you can no longer be trusted on programs in the US, that's a big issue with me."" 
Tobin Smith, vice president for science policy and global affairs at the Association of American Universities said universities have struggled with assessing risk and welcomed the blueprint.
""The issue is most of the time universities don't have the resources to be aware that something's been stolen from them until it becomes a national security issue and it's a front page headline somewhere,"" said Jason Jardine a patent lawyer at Knobbe Martens Olson & Bear who works with universities on patent theft. 
Emily Weinstein, an analyst at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, said the challenge will be to define which Chinese entities are defense-affiliated. While some universities in China are clearly tied to the military, the links aren't always clear-cut.

""On paper, these measures seem fine,"" said Qiaojing Ella Zheng, a partner at Sanford Heisler Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) who is also president of the Chinese American Lawyers of the Bay Area. ""The problem always occurs during the implementation and enforcement. The entire Asian American community here in the U.S. and abroad will be watching closely how this action plan unfolds in practice.""

The CBS broadcast network released two brief clips from Winfrey's interview of the couple, which is scheduled to air on March 7. It is the first TV interview the couple, formally known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have given since making their homes in California last year.
""My biggest concern was history repeating itself,"" Harry said, apparently referring to his mother Princess Diana, who was hounded by the British press and died at age 36 in a car crash in Paris after her divorce from Prince Charles.
Harry, 36, was seated next to Meghan, 39, and holding her hand. The couple announced this month that they are expecting their second child.
""I'm just really relieved and happy to be sitting her talking to you with my wife by my side,"" Harry said. ""Because I can't imagine what it must have been like for her (Diana), going through this process by herself all those years ago.
""It's been unbelievably tough for the two of us, but at least we had each other,"" Harry added.
In the clips, Winfrey said that no subject was off limits and at one point tells the couple ""you have said some pretty shocking things here,"" including that their situation had been ""almost unsurvivable.""
Before they moved to California, the couple had complained about the British tabloids' treatment of Meghan, whose father is white and mother is African-American, some of which they said amounted to bullying or racism.

Earlier this month, Buckingham Palace announced that the couple would not be returning to their lives as working members of the royal family.

(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's office cleared the way on Sunday for an independent attorney with subpoena powers to investigate allegations against him of sexual misconduct. 
The governor's office backtracked on its original plan to choose its own investigator after widespread criticism from fellow Democrats. 
""We will hire a law firm, deputize them as attorneys of our office, and oversee a rigorous and independent investigation,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. 
Cuomo, one of the nation's most well-known Democratic politicians whose popularity soared during the early months of the pandemic, has been accused by two former aides of sexual misconduct, sparking criticism from fellow Democrats that ranged from calls for his resignation to appeals for an independent investigation into his behavior. 
Responding to the latest allegations that emerged on Saturday, the governor denied making any sexual advances and initially ordered what he said would be a ""full and thorough outside review"" led by a former federal judge, Barbara Jones. 
But following sharp rebukes from Democrats, Cuomo reversed that decision - and issued a statement late on Sunday saying he ""never intended to offend anyone or cause harm."" 
Cuomo said he is often jocular around the office and in public, citing his frequent press conferences that included plenty of banter with members of the media.
""I now understand that my interactions may have been insensitive or too personal and that some of my comments, given my position, made others feel in ways I never intended,"" Cuomo said in a statement. 
'PAINFUL TO READ'
Cuomo on Saturday ordered what he said would be a ""full and thorough outside review"" led by Jones. But that move was quickly rejected by leading Democratic figures including U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who said she found the accounts of Cuomo's former aides Lindsey Boylan and Charlotte Bennett ""extremely serious and painful to read.""
There were also demands for an independent probe from several other Democrats. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told CNN's State of the Union that President Joe Biden supported such an investigation. Others, including New York State Senator Alessandra Biaggi and New York City Councilman Carlos Menchaca, went further, echoing Republican calls for Cuomo to resign. 
In the latest misconduct allegations, Bennett, who worked for the governor as an executive assistant and policy advisor for nearly two years until November 2020, told the New York Times that he had asked her about her sex life, including whether she was monogamous in her relationships and if she had ever had sex with older men.
Her account was published days after Boylan, another former aide, wrote in an online essay that the governor made several ""inappropriate gestures"" toward her while she worked for the state government from 2015 to 2018, including sending her a rose on Valentine's Day and kissing her on the mouth. 
Cuomo has denied wrongdoing in both cases. Reuters could not independently verify the women's accounts. Attempts to reach both women have been unsuccessful.
Cuomo rose to national prominence for his daily televised briefings early on during the coronavirus pandemic, when New York was the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States.
The allegations of sexual misconduct follow a report issued in January by James' office that cast doubt on his administration's handling of the coronavirus crisis in nursing homes. It said the state health department significantly undercounted the death toll and implemented policies that may have contributed to it.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Sunday that there now needed to be two independent investigations, one into Cuomo's conduct and another into the nursing home deaths. 

""Questions of this magnitude cannot hang over the heads of New Yorkers as we fight off a pandemic and economic crisis,"" de Blasio said in a statement.

1381,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2021 05:45PM ET</span>",Iran dismisses idea of talks with EU and U.S. to revive 2015 nuclear deal,"By Parisa Hafezi
DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran on Sunday ruled out holding an informal meeting with the United States and other major powers to discuss ways to salvage the unravelling 2015 nuclear deal, insisting Washington must first lift all its unilateral sanctions.
""Considering the recent actions and statements by the United States and three European powers, Iran does not consider this the time to hold an informal meeting with these countries, which was proposed by the EU foreign policy chief,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said, according to Iranian media.
The United States said it was disappointed but remained ready to ""re-engage in meaningful diplomacy"" and would consult with the other major powers to seek a way forward.
Iranian officials had said Tehran was studying a proposal by European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell to hold an informal meeting with other parties to the nuclear pact and the United States, which reimposed sanctions on Iran after then-President Donald Trump quit the deal in 2018.
The new administration of President Joe Biden has said it is ready to talk to Iran about both nations resuming compliance with the accord, which scrapped broad economic sanctions against Iran in return for curbs intended to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons - something Iran says it does not want.
But the parties cannot agree who should make the first move. Iran says the United States must lift sanctions, while Washington says Tehran must return to compliance with the deal, which Iran has been progressively breaching since 2019.
A White House spokeswoman said Washington remained keen to achieve a ""mutual return to compliance"" with the deal.
She said it would consult with the major powers that are also parties to the deal - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - on the best way forward.
NOT 'THE END OF THE ROAD'
One senior U.S. source said Iran's rejection was simply part of the diplomatic process.
Separately, a senior U.S. official said the United States was not wedded to any particular format for talks.
""We don't think that this is the end of the road. It's unfortunate ... that the Iranians said: 'No,' but we'll be open to other ideas,"" said the senior U.S. official. 
""If they want us to consider some other format, we're not going to be sticklers for format,"" he added.
Earlier, Iran's nuclear chief urged the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) 35-nation Board of Governors not to endorse a U.S.-led push to criticise Tehran's decision to scale back its cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog. 
""If the IAEA's Board of Governors adopts a resolution against Iran, we will show an appropriate reaction,"" Ali Akbar Salehi said, according to the Iranian state news agency, IRNA. 
In a position paper seen by Reuters and sent to other IAEA member states before the board's quarterly meeting this week, Tehran threatens to end a deal struck with the IAEA a week ago temporarily maintaining some monitoring of its activities.
Diplomats said it was unclear whether the board would adopt a resolution.
Last Tuesday, Tehran stopped implementing the so-called Additional Protocol, which had enabled the IAEA to carry out snap inspections at undeclared locations. 
But under the Feb. 21 agreement, Tehran agreed to maintain the recording of extra data as specified by the 2015 deal for up to three months, and to let the IAEA access it at the end if sanctions were lifted.

Khatibzadeh said there was no need for a ""negotiation or a resolution"" by the IAEA board of governors for the United States to ""end its illegal and unilateral sanctions and return to its commitments.""

The government of Prime Minister Igor Matovic released details of the new measures after several days of debates with experts as the country has ranked among the world's worst-hit by the recent wave of COVID-19 cases.
As of Wednesday, people will be allowed to travel from 8:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. only to work or to see a doctor, while all currently valid exceptions from the limits on movement will be effective only between 5:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. People who can work from home should do so.
As of March 8, more effective respirators of FFP 2 grade will be required for people in shops or on public transport.
Pre-schooling and the lower grades at elementary schools will be open only for children of parents whose work cannot be done from home.
If the tougher restrictions do not curb infections by March 21, the government will prepare even stricter limits on movement, including closure of companies and borders, local media reported.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's former Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, a technocrat who had previously refused any direct party affiliation, on Sunday took on the task of reviving the fortunes of the 5-Star Movement as it struggles to find a way out of a political crisis.
5-Star, the largest group in parliament thanks to its triumph at a 2018 election when it won 32.7% of the vote, has seen its support shrink steadily and is now polling at around 15%.
Its decision this month to support the new government of national unity led by former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi further divided and weakened it, triggering the defection of members who deemed it a betrayal of 5-Star's original anti-establishment identity.
""Giuseppe Conte has accepted the task ... of drawing up a project to refound the 5-Star Movement,"" the party said after a Rome meeting between Conte and 5-Star's top brass including its founder, former comedian Beppe Grillo.
It said Conte would lead ""a total restructuring"" of 5-Star, created by Grillo in 2009 as an anti-system protest movement.
Ecology and the fight against inequality and corruption will remain central planks of 5-Star's platform, the party said in a message on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), adding that it would work increasingly closely with associations and movements not directly involved in party politics.
Conte is one of Italy's most popular politicians and has always been close to 5-Star. A survey by the Ipsos agency in January gave him an approval rating of around 56%.
By tying his fortunes to 5-Star, Conte will lose his former status as a non-partisan mediator between 5-Star and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), the main backers of his government which collapsed in January due to a coalition rupture.
Nonetheless, he is expected to try to foster a stable alliance with the PD to try to compete with the rightist bloc of parties led by Matteo Salvini's League which currently lead in opinion polls. The next election is due in 2023.

After Sunday's development, it is expected that Conte will soon be formally named as the new 5-Star leader, replacing caretaker Vito Crimi. Alternatively, he may join a steering committee along with a small group of other senior members.

Dillo, who plans to run against President Idriss Deby in a presidential election in April, told Reuters he was attacked at home by members of the presidential guard and that five family members were killed, including his mother.
The government said in a statement that security forces went to Dillo's home to arrest him after he refused to respond to two judicial mandates and were met with armed resistance. It did not say what the mandates were concerning. 
Two people were killed and five wounded in the ensuing fight, including three policemen, it said. 
Internet has been cut in the capital N'Djamena since early Sunday morning, said a Reuters witness.
Internet monitor NetBlocks said Internet disruption in the central African country was ongoing. Real-time data showed national connectivity was down to 60% of ordinary levels since 9:30 am local time (0830 GMT). 
Dillo said his gate was crushed by an armoured vehicle and his house has been surrounded by government forces since the incident.
Videos shared on Twitter showed a Chadian military tank moving on a house, while a crowd pelted it with objects. Another video showed several similar armoured vehicles lining a street. Reuters has not verified the videos. 
Dillo is a formal rebel leader who fought against Deby in 2006 before joining his government and becoming a minister. More recently, he served as Chad's representative to the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).
He is one of 16 people who have announced they will run against Deby in April's election. 
Deby, who has been in power since 1990, pushed through a new constitution in 2018 that reinstated term limits but could let him stay in power until 2033. 
Hundreds took to the streets earlier this month to protest his candidacy in the upcoming election.
Deby has faced strikes and protests in recent years over economic woes caused by low oil prices and armed rebellions in the north, but has drawn on his effective control of state media and institutions to maintain political dominance.

Chad is a key ally of Western nations in the fight against Islamist militants in West and Central Africa.

The variant, which was first identified in Britain, started spreading in Oslo in January and now accounts for 50-70% of infections, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) said on Saturday. 
On Friday, Oslo registered a daily record of 245 new coronavirus infections. 
""We have to tighten the measures,"" Raymond Johansen, the governing mayor of Oslo, told a news conference. 
The infection numbers rose due to increased mobility, faster virus spread, as well as more testing, he added. 
In Oslo, all restaurants, except take-away services, and non-essential shops, except groceries, pharmacies and liquor stores, will have to close from Tuesday, while the ""red"" level is imposed at upper secondary schools, meaning that students, who were fully back at school, will now do some online learning.
All organised outdoor leisure activities for adults, as well as private gatherings and home visits should be avoided, except for kids, Johansen said.
The city also planned to start mass testing at schools later in March to better track the virus spread. 
Oslo has already closed shopping centres due to the spread of the more contagious variant in January.
As of Feb. 25, the nation of 5.4 million has vaccinated close to 320,000 people with a first dose, and nearly 150,000 have received two doses, according to data from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.

Norway's 14-day cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was at 70 in the week ending Feb. 21, the third-lowest in Europe behind Iceland and Liechtenstein, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control showed.

GUSAU, Nigeria (Reuters) - Relatives of more than 300 girls abducted by gunmen from their boarding school in northwest Nigeria endured an agonising wait for news amid rumours that they had been released, while security forces continued their search on Sunday. 
An armed gang kidnapped 317 girls from the Government Girls Science Secondary School in the town of Jangebe, in Zamfara state, at around 1 a.m. on Friday.
Two Reuters' correspondents saw a heavy military presence in state capital Gusau on Sunday, with army trucks moving in convoy and police checkpoints on major roads.
Zamfara police have worked alongside the army in a search-and-rescue operation since Friday. 
The raid in Zamfara state was the second such kidnapping in little over a week in the northwest of the country, where schools have become targets for mass kidnappings for ransom. Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday urged state governments not to reward ""bandits"" with money or vehicles.
School kidnappings were first carried out by jihadist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province but the tactic has now been adopted by other militants whose agenda is unclear.
On Saturday, gunmen released 27 teenage boys who had been kidnapped from their school on Feb. 17 in neighbouring Niger state. 
Parents in Zamfara are hopeful that they too will receive good news. 
Balarabe Kagara, whose two 14-year-old daughters are among those taken, said he was praying for their safe return and remained hopeful. 
""I will be very happy if I see my daughters,"" the 54-year-old farmer said, his voice cracking with emotion, while sitting on a mattress on the floor and gazing at pictures of the two girls.
Rumours circulated on social media on Sunday that the girls had been released. They prompted Zamfara state government to issue a statement in which it said the governor Bello Matawalle was unhappy that someone would ""try to further hurt the victims' parents"" with ""falsehood"". 
Abubakar Isa, whose 17-year-old daughter is among those missing, said his hopes and those of other parents were initially lifted by the rumour.
""We heard that they will be released today, so we gathered at the school premises to receive them but it turned out to be rumours,"" he told Reuters by telephone. 
Isa said Saturday's release of the boys taken in Niger gave him hope, but he remained fearful of the gunmen's motives. 
On Friday, Zamfara's governor ordered all boarding schools to close immediately. 
At his home in Gusau, Kagara said he was unsure about whether children would eventually return to school. 
""If there is enough security, I believe people will return their children to school,"" he said. ""But if there is no security, nobody will think of taking their children to school again.""

POKROV, Russia (Reuters) - Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny has been transferred to a penal colony outside Moscow to serve his prison sentence, a public commission said on Sunday, weeks after he returned to Russia after being poisoned.
Navalny's whereabouts had been unknown since Thursday when his allies learned that he was transferred out of one of Moscow's most infamous jails to an undisclosed location. 
Navalny, 44, was arrested on his return from Germany last month and has been sentenced to more than 2-1/2 years for parole violations that he said were trumped up. 
He has been transferred to a penal colony in the Vladimir region, the Moscow Public Monitoring Commission that defends the rights of prisoners and has access to people in custody, said on its website.
The state news agency TASS specified that Navalny will serve his term in penal colony number 2 in the town of Pokrov, about 100 km (60 miles) east of Moscow. 
Reuters pictures showed metallic grey buildings behind a grey fence and barbed wire inside the colony, as well as the gold domes of a church. A guard at the gate asked reporters to keep a distance of at least 100 metres (yards) if they wanted to film it. 
Ruslan Vakhapov, a local activist of the prisoners' rights group Jailed Russia, described conditions as particularly severe.
""In short, it's a bad colony,"" Ruslan Vakhapov told Reuters by phone. 
Many prisoners cooperate with the colony administration and help them to control other inmates closely, abusing them if they violate a strict daily schedule, Vakhapov said.
""If there is a need to prevent Navalny from communicating with others, nobody would talk to him,"" the activist said.
""(If anything happens), he wouldn't be able to ask for help until his lawyer arrives,"" he added.
A duty officer who took a call at the prison declined to answer questions about Navalny.
Navalny will be quarantined as a precaution against the spread of coronavirus before joining other prisoners in the colony, the monitoring commission said, according to the RIA news agency.
Earlier on Sunday a Navalny ally, Leonid Volkov, called on Twitter for authorities to provide official information about his whereabouts and access to him by his lawyers.
Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, suffered a near-fatal poisoning in Siberia in August with what many Western nations said was a nerve agent. Navalny accuses Putin of ordering his attempted murder. 

Putin has dismissed that, alleging Navalny is part of a U.S.-backed dirty tricks campaign to discredit him.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - COVID-19 curbs have curtailed celebrations of the Jewish costume festival of Purim, with Israeli police preventing parties and some rabbis urging people not to drink too much so social distancing is maintained.
Drawn from the biblical Book of Esther's account of how the Jews were spared genocide in ancient Persia, Purim is commemorated with the wearing of all kinds of fancy dress costumes, donating food for feasts - and drinking to excess.
But this year, Israel, which began emerging from its third national lockdown on Feb. 21, reimposed night curfews for the long Purim weekend and limited access to Jerusalem.
Purim parties were banned, with fines for anyone hosting them. That led to spontaneous street parties in Tel Aviv. Police commander Ziv Saguy said they were giving out 200 fines an hour.
Long traffic jams formed on the road to Jerusalem as police tried to stop large groups of reaching the holy city for the festival. Some people ditched their vehicles and walked up the highway instead.
Excessive drinking is a key part of the festival but several ultra-Orthodox Jewish leaders took out a front-page ad in a community newspaper urging a more abstemious Purim this year.
""He who gets drunk loses his clarity of mind and is liable not to conduct himself with the necessary caution to safeguard his health"", the ad read, according to the Arutz 7 news site.
Israel's tight-knit ultra-Orthodox community has been especially hard-hit by COVID-19. According to one Health Ministry official, they make up about 15% of the population but have at times accounted for as much as 35% of coronavirus cases. 
Some ultra-Orthodox have also defied state-ordered closures of schools and synagogues, touching off clashes with police.
As Purim festivities wound down on Sunday, one such confrontation flared up in Mea Shearim, an ultra-Orthodox district of Jerusalem, when costumed celebrants put up an effigy of the national police chief, a Reuters photographer said.

Riot police in surgical masks closed in, removing the effigy and scattering the celebrants, some of whom yelled abuse at the officers while others danced. Saguy said two men were arrested.

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2021 10:15AM ET</span>",'How many dead bodies?' asked Myanmar protester killed on bloodiest day,"(Reuters) - The day before he was killed, internet network engineer Nyi Nyi Aung Htet Naing had posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) about the increasingly violent military crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Myanmar.
""#How_Many_Dead_Bodies_UN_Need_To_Take_Action,” he wrote, in reference to the United Nations.
He was among the first shot dead in Myanmar's biggest city of Yangon on Sunday, the bloodiest day since the Feb. 1 coup prompted daily protests against the junta and to demand the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
The United Nations Human Rights Office said at least 18 people had been killed and 30 wounded on Sunday, bringing the total number of protesters killed since the coup to at least 21. The army says one policeman has died in the unrest. 
Authorities did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday's violence. 
The state-run Global New Light Of Myanmar said the army had previously shown restraint, but could not ignore ""anarchic mobs"". It said ""severe action will be inevitably taken"" against ""riotous protesters.""
With daily protests and strikes paralysing a country where the army had promised to bring order, soldiers and police intensified their crackdown at the weekend.
Nyi Nyi Aung Htet Naing was shot a few hundred metres (yards) from Hledan Junction, a regular protest gathering point.
Video from an apartment above records the sound of gunshots as Nyi Nyi lies slumped outside the gate of the Kamaryut township high school - dressed in a check shirt and with a builder's white hard hat, his phone in his hand.
Several protesters sprint past the body before five gain courage to carry him away, crouching as they run, the video from website Myanmar Now that was republished by Reuters shows.
It was too late to save him.
A U.N official speaking on condition of anonymity said Nyi Nyi was one of at least five killed people in Yangon. One had been shot in the eye. A middle school teacher died of a suspected heart attack from a stun grenade blast, her colleagues said.
The teachers tried to assemble early, but police threw stun grenades and charged in to break up the protest.
""Many were wounded. I have no weapon. I just came here to protest peacefully. Whatever they do, we just have to take it,"" said teacher Hayman May Hninsi.
FACE-OFF 
Across the country, protesters wearing plastic work helmets and with makeshift shields faced off against police and soldiers in battle gear, including some from units notorious for tough crackdowns on ethnic rebel groups in Myanmar's border regions.
In the coastal town of Dawei, security forces opened fire on demonstrators in the middle of the road, witnesses said.
Video footage shared on social media shows a protester clad in jeans and flip flops lying motionless after the crowd scatters. Soldiers walk past the body and begin beating another protester.
In Myanmar's second city of Mandalay, a man was shot dead as he rode his motorbike. Protesters carried his lifeless body to an ambulance. The bullet pierced his red helmet, leaving it drenched in blood, images on social media showed.
The live video and photos shared on social media, not all of which were verified by Reuters, showed medics rushing to retrieve the dead and injured, carrying them away on stretchers, stuffing cotton wool into gaping wounds.
One front-line reporter posted on Facebook that police had told people they were not shooting because they had been ordered to.
""We shoot because we want to. Get inside your homes if you don't want to die,"" she quoted one as shouting.
Yangon echoed to the sound of stun grenades and rubber bullets and the occasional zip of a live round.
Despite the crackdown, protesters moved to different districts, setting up roadblocks with wheeled garbage bins, lighting poles and concrete blocks.
Some held riot shields homemade from tin sheet and stencilled with the word ""PEOPLE"" to contrast with those labelled ""POLICE"".
Protesters wrote their blood group and a contact number for next of kin on their forearms in case they were wounded.
Until nightfall, demonstrations flared and subsided.

""Young people are resisting state oppression with anything they have,"" said youth activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi. ""We won't let military rule us again. Never again.""

1390,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2021 10:01AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Biden in no rush to lift Venezuela sanctions, seeks 'serious steps' by Maduro","By Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden’s administration is in “no rush” to lift U.S. sanctions on Venezuela but would consider easing them if President Nicolas Maduro takes confidence-building steps showing he is ready to negotiate seriously with the opposition, a White House official told Reuters.
Signaling that the new U.S. president may be unlikely to loosen the screws on Venezuela anytime soon, the official emphasized that existing sanctions have enough special provisions to allow for humanitarian aid shipments to help Venezuelans cope with economic hardships and the COVID-19 pandemic.
But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Maduro’s Socialist government has been “actively preventing the delivery of humanitarian assistance.”
This suggests that for now Biden is prepared to stick with the specific sanctions, including crippling oil-sector penalties, imposed by former President Donald Trump on the OPEC nation, despite the failure to force Maduro from power.
But Biden, by contrast, intends to move away from the mostly unilateral approach of Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign and enlist more countries to help seek a diplomatic solution, the official said in an interview.
Biden’s administration has made clear it will continue to recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president. Dozens of countries have backed Guaido’s claim following Maduro’s re-election in 2018 in a vote Western governments called a sham, though cracks recently have appeared in Guaido's international support. 
“We’re in no rush to lift sanctions,” the official said. “If the regime undertakes confidence-building measures that show that they're ready and willing to engage in real conversations with the opposition ... if they're ready to take serious steps, then we will consider the alleviation of sanctions.""
The official did not specify what steps Maduro would need to make but said he could not be allowed to use negotiations as a “delaying tactic” to consolidate power and divide the opposition, as he has been accused of doing in the past.
Maduro, who calls Guaido a U.S. puppet, has shown no signs of giving ground. Having retained support of the military as well as Russia, China, Cuba and Iran, he has rejected or ignored previous demands for such concessions.
The Biden administration also appears to have little sense of urgency for major gestures toward Cuba despite hopes for a softer approach after Trump, often citing its support for Maduro, rolled back historic Obama-era détente with Havana.
Some Biden advisers had suggested earlier that he could start by loosening up the flow of remittances from Cuban Americans and ease restrictions on family travel to the Communist-ruled island.
But while acknowledging such changes could have a positive impact, the official said a Cuba policy shift was not currently among Biden’s top priorities, which include the coronavirus pandemic, economic recovery and rebuilding alliances abroad.
“Frankly, first things first,” the official said.

There has also been no sign of any immediate plans to rescind Cuba’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, though Biden officials have said Trump’s last-minute decision to return Havana to the U.S. blacklist is under review.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan's interior and justice ministers were fired on Sunday for attending a dinner party at a restaurant that violated the coronavirus restrictions that their own ministries are supposed to enforce.
Prime Minister Bisher al Khasawneh accepted the resignation of Interior Minister Samir Mobeideen and Justice Minister Bassam Talhouni, days after the announcement of new rules intended to stem a month-old surge of infections driven by a more contagious variant of the virus.
Their appearance in a public banqueting room, disregarding social distancing rules, added to widespread outrage at the hefty fines slapped on ordinary people while officials go unpunished for attending functions with far more than the 20 guests allowed.
Police have arrested dozens of people for breaking stay-at-home orders in recent weeks and shut hundreds of shops and businesses in one of the toughest crackdowns in a year of lockdowns and restrictions.
The government has also deployed more military personnel at hundreds of checkpoints to enforce last Thursday's decision to bring forward a curfew from midnight to 10 p.m.
Officials say the latest wave of infections has been driven by people flouting restrictions on movement.
Under the new rules, anyone not wearing a face mask in public can be fined up to 100 dinars ($140), a punitive sum in a relatively poor country where the pandemic has pushed unemployment to record levels.

The kingdom, with a population of around 10 million, has recorded 380,268 coronavirus infections and 4,627 deaths.

1392,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2021 09:27AM ET</span>",At least 18 killed in Myanmar on bloodiest day of protests against coup,"(Reuters) - Myanmar police fired on protesters around the country on Sunday in the bloodiest day of weeks of demonstrations against a military coup and at least 18 people were killed, the U.N. human rights office said.
Police were out in force early and opened fire in different parts of the biggest city of Yangon after stun grenades, tear gas and shots in the air failed to break up crowds. Soldiers also reinforced police.
Several wounded people were hauled away by fellow protesters, leaving bloody smears on pavements, media images showed. One man died after being brought to a hospital with a bullet in the chest, said a doctor who asked not to be identified.
""Police and military forces have confronted peaceful demonstrations, using lethal force and less-than-lethal force that – according to credible information received by the UN Human Rights Office – has left at least 18 people dead and over 30 wounded,"" the U.N. human rights office said.
Myanmar has been in chaos since the army seized power and detained elected government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and much of her party leadership on Feb. 1, alleging fraud in a November election her party won in a landslide.
The coup, which brought a halt to tentative steps towards democracy after nearly 50 years of military rule, has drawn hundreds of thousands onto the streets and the condemnation of Western countries.
Among the dead were three people in Dawei in the south, politician Kyaw Min Htike told Reuters from the town. 
The Myanmar Now media outlet reported two people had been killed in a protest in the second city of Mandalay. Security forces fired again later in the day and one woman was killed, Mandalay resident Sai Tun told Reuters.
""The medical team checked her and confirmed she didn't make it. She was shot in the head,"" Sai Tun said.
Police and the spokesman for the ruling military council did not respond to phone calls seeking comment.
The dead in Yangon included a teacher, Tin New Yee, who died after police swooped to disperse a teachers' protest with stun grenades, sending the crowd fleeing, her daughter and a fellow teacher said.
Police also hurled stun grenades outside a Yangon medical school, sending doctors and students in white lab coats scattering. A group called the Whitecoat Alliance of medics said more than 50 medical staff had been arrested.
Police broke up protests in other towns, including Lashio in the northeast, Myeik in the deep south and Hpa-An in the east, residents and media said.
'OUTRAGEOUS' 
Junta leader General Min Aung Hlaing said last week authorities were using minimal force to deal with the protests.
Nevertheless, at least 21 protesters have now died in the turmoil. The army said a policeman has been killed.
The crackdown would appear to indicate determination by the military to impose its authority in the face of defiance, not just on the streets but more broadly in the civil service, municipal administration, the judiciary, the education and health sectors and the media.
""The Myanmar security forces' clear escalation in use of lethal force in multiple towns and cities ... is outrageous and unacceptable,"" Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.
The Canadian Embassy said it was ""appalled by a trend of increased violence and use of force against protesters"" and Indonesia, which has taken the lead within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in efforts to resolve the turmoil, said it was deeply concerned.
State-run MRTV television said more than 470 people had been arrested on Saturday when police launched the nationwide crackdown. It was not clear how many were detained on Sunday.
'INSTIL FEAR'
Youth activist Esther Ze Naw said people were battling the fear they had lived with under military rule.
""It's obvious they're trying to instil fear in us by making us run and hide,"" she said. ""We can't accept that.""
State television announced on Saturday that Myanmar's U.N. envoy had been fired for betraying the country, after he urged the United Nations to use ""any means necessary"" to reverse the coup.
The ambassador, Kyaw Moe Tun, remained defiant. ""I decided to fight back as long as I can,"" he told Reuters in New York.
While Western countries have condemned the coup and some have imposed limited sanctions, the generals have traditionally shrugged off diplomatic pressure. They have promised to hold a new election but not set a date.
Suu Kyi's party and supporters said the result of the November vote must be respected.

Suu Kyi, 75, who spent nearly 15 years under house arrest, faces charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios and of violating a natural disaster law by breaching coronavirus protocols. The next hearing in her case is on Monday.

Protesters threw bottles at police and marched right up to a barricade of shipping containers and barbed wire at the entrance to the base of the 1st Infantry Regiment in Bangkok, one of several army units that government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha transferred to the king's control in 2019.
The Thai youth-led political movement rose up last year to demand Prayuth's resignation and broke taboos by calling for reforms of the monarchy.
Protesters also showed support for anti-coup demonstrations in Myanmar, which has been in chaos since the army seized power and detained elected government leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Prince Mohammed, de facto ruler of the U.S.-allied Gulf powerhouse, has denied any involvement in the 2018 murder of Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. 
The U.S. administration on Friday imposed sanctions on some of those involved, but spared the prince. Washington released an intelligence report saying the crown prince had approved an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi.
""America does not have the right to bully a strategic regional ally and it is not in its interest to let domestic differences harm its regional interests and those of its partners,"" Khaled al-Malik wrote in local Al Jazirah newspaper.
President Joe Biden's decision to publish the report withheld by his Republican predecessor Donald Trump, who enjoyed strong ties with Prince Mohammed, brings with it a refocusing of Washington's stance on dealing with the kingdom, on its human rights record, and on its lucrative arms purchases.
Malik said Saudi Arabia, which has relied on the United States for its defence including during the first Gulf War and after 2019 attacks on its massive oil infrastructure, could look to China and Russia for weapons.
""But the kingdom prefers America due to their historic and strategic ties and common goals,"" he said, referring to Iran.
Biden, who has ordered a review of Saudi arms sales, said his administration would make an announcement on Saudi Arabia on Monday.
Abdullah al-Otaibi, writing in London-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper which is Saudi-owned, said the kingdom, Washington's oldest Arab ally, was ""not a banana republic to be shaken by threats"".
The Saudi government has repeated previous statements that Khashoggi's killing was a heinous crime by a rogue group, for which a Saudi court jailed eight people last year. 
""We want to strengthen deep-rooted ties (with the U.S.) but not at the expense of our sovereignty. Our judiciary and our decisions are a red line,"" Fahim al-Hamid wrote in Okaz newspaper.
Since the U.S. report was released, many Saudis have flooded Twitter with the hashtag ""We are all Mohammed bin Salman"".

Saudi Arabia's highest religious authority issued a statement on Sunday rejecting the report as ""false and unacceptable"". The head of the kingdom's morality police tweeted that it was a duty under Islam to defend the kingdom and its leaders.

The MV Helios Ray, a vehicle-carrier ship, was hit overnight between Thursday and Friday by a blast above the water line that a U.S. defence official said ripped holes in both sides of its hull.
Israel's defence minister on Saturday said that an initial assessment had found that Iran was responsible for the explosion. There was no immediate comment from Iranian officials.
The blue and white ship is now berthed in Dubai's Port Rashid, having sailed from its position off the coast of Omani capital Muscat, where the explosion occurred. 
The Gulf of Oman links to Gulf waters via the strategically important Hormuz Strait, a narrow passage between Iran and Oman through which almost a fifth of the world's oil passes. 
An Israeli delegation was en route to Dubai to investigate the incident, Israeli Channel 13 News reported Saturday.
A spokesman for Dubai state port operator DP World, which owns and operates the dry docks, had said earlier on Sunday that the ship was due to arrive on Monday for assessment. 
The MV Helios Ray is owned by Tel Aviv-based Ray Shipping Ltd through a company registered in the Isle of Man, a U.N. shipping database shows.
Tensions have risen in the Gulf region since the United States reimposed sanctions on Iran in 2018 after then-President Donald Trump withdrew from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers.

Since then Washington has blamed Iran for a number of attacks on shipping in Gulf waters, including two Saudi oil tankers. Iran distanced itself from those attacks.

1396,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2021 05:21AM ET</span>",Arrival of 'sticky bombs' in Indian Kashmir sets off alarm bells,"By Fayaz Bukhari and Devjyot Ghoshal
SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Security forces battling a decades-long insurgency in Indian-controlled Kashmir are alarmed by the recent arrival in the disputed region of small, magnetic bombs that have wreaked havoc in Afghanistan.
""Sticky bombs"", which can be attached to vehicles and detonated remotely, have been seized during raids in recent months in the federally administered region of Jammu and Kashmir, three senior security officials told Reuters.
""These are small IEDs and quite powerful,"" said Kashmir Valley police chief Vijay Kumar, referring to improvised explosive devices. ""It will certainly impact the present security scenario as volume and frequency of vehicular movements of police and security forces are high in Kashmir Valley.""
The Indian government flooded Kashmir, already one of the world's most militarised regions, with more troops in August 2019, when it split the country's only Muslim-majority state into two federally administered territories.
The arrival of the sticky bombs in India-controlled Kashmir - including 15 seized in a February raid - raises concerns that an unnerving tactic attributed to the Taliban insurgents in nearby Afghanistan could be spreading to the India-Pakistan conflict.
Afghanistan in recent months has seen a series of sticky-bomb attacks targeting security forces, judges, government officials, civil society activists and journalists. The attacks - some as victims sat in traffic - have sown fear, while avoiding substantial civilian casualties.
None of the devices seized in Kashmir was produced there, a senior security official said, suggesting they were being smuggled from Pakistan. ""All of them have come via drone drops and tunnels,"" he said, asking not to be named.
Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan, which each claim all of the Himalayan region but rule only parts of it.
India accuses Pakistan of backing the insurgency in Kashmir, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives since the 1990s. Pakistan denies the charge, saying it gives only moral and diplomatic support to Kashmiri people fighting for self-determination.
New Delhi has attempted to maintain a tight grip over the Kashmir Valley, where high-speed mobile internet was suspended for 18 months until earlier in February, but the insurgency has simmered on.
Officials said the bombs are particularly worrying because they can be easily attached to vehicles using magnets, potentially allowing militants to carry out assassinations or target military convoys that regularly criss-cross the valley.
In February 2019, a suicide bomber drove a car laden with explosives into a convoy in Kashmir's Pulwama, killing 40 soldiers - the deadliest attack on Indian forces in the region - bringing India and Pakistan to the brink of another war.
Police chief Kumar said that security forces were changing protocols to deal with the new threat. The measures included increasing the distance between private and military traffic, installing more cameras on vehicles and using drones to monitor convoys.
A difference between militants in Kashmir and Afghanistan is that the Taliban have tremendous ability to move around in urban and rural areas, which, along with the easier availability of explosives, make the bombs a potent threat.
The Taliban, which initially said it was behind some of the attacks, has since denied any involvement in the attacks.
""The Taliban has targets, can reach them, and kill them with impunity. The whole structure of the attack - and its endless repetition - is what makes the bomb effective,"" said Avinash Paliwal, a senior lecturer in international relations at SOAS University of London. 

""In Kashmir, the space for such ability to manoeuvre with ease is limited.""

The Ailuromania Cat Cafe, which was the Middle East's first cat cafe when it opened in 2015, hopes the relaxing properties of its 25 rescue and shelter cats will help find them their forever homes.
""Anyone who is stressed just has to find a cat. All your stress will go away,"" said Omnia Fareed, whose two cat-loving sisters Allaa and Iman started the cafe after university, taking inspiration from similar establishments in Korea and London. 
The cafe's original residents were strays taken in by the family over the years. Now Ailuromania hosts cats from a government-run animal shelter in the neighbouring emirate of Ras al Khaimah, hoping to increase adoptions. 
The cafe's name Ailuromania is a play on the Greek-derived English word for a lover of cats: ailurophile.
The cafe has regular customers who come seeking relaxation from the stresses of life, or because they cannot keep a cat at home.
""They are so cute, they love playing,"" said visitor Shaasthra. She said she appreciates how the cafe looks after the cats' welfare by advising people not to hold them or wake them up.
Another regular visitor, a street cat who would stare in through the window, was also invited and eventually adopted. 
Since Dubai began lifting coronavirus lockdown measures last summer, the cafe re-opened with capacity and sanitisation restrictions.
Dubai has a large number of stray cats, with many abandoned on the streets by their owners. In 2018 UAE authorities made it illegal to abandon animals, but animal welfare activists in Dubai have for years called for a large-scale trap-neuter-release scheme and feeding programmes to bring numbers down humanely.

In August, Dubai municipality issued a circular restating a policy of fining anyone caught feeding strays, saying it increases the spread of diseases.

WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is expected to ask President Joe Biden to consider sharing part of the U.S. coronavirus vaccine supply with its poorer southern neighbor when the two leaders hold a virtual summit on Monday, U.S. and Mexican officials said.
    Biden is open to discussing the matter as part of a broader regional effort to cooperate in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic but will maintain as his “number one priority” the need to first vaccinate as many Americans as possible, a White House official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Lopez Obrador has been one of the most vocal leaders in the developing world pressing the richest countries to improve poorer nations’ access to the vaccines. He has called the current distribution system “totally unfair.”
“We fully expect that to come up,” the White House official said when asked whether Lopez Obrador was likely to raise a request for shared vaccines when the leaders hold their first virtual meeting since Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration.
A Mexican official said Lopez Obrador would ask for a loan of the U.S. vaccine supplies, to be paid back when vaccines that Mexico has contracts for are delivered later in the year.
Lopez Obrador’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Mexican media outlet Proceso, Lopez Obrador raised the issue with Biden in a January call shortly after his swearing-in.
The agenda for the summit, to be held virtually due to COVID-19 concerns, is also expected to include migration, the thorniest bilateral issue, together with law enforcement cooperation and economic development plans for southern Mexico and Central America, the U.S. official said.
Mexico had a testy relationship with Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, though Lopez Obrador, an often abrasive leftist, forged a mutually beneficial partnership with the Republican president as they worked to stem migration from impoverished Central America.
Biden has been undoing what his White House has called “draconian” Trump-era immigration policies that closed off routes to asylum in the United States, while trying to curb an increasing flow of new undocumented arrivals until the system for legal migration is overhauled.
Seeking to turn the page on Trump, the White House official said Biden was determined to move away from the former president’s “governing by tweet” and re-establish more traditional contacts.
The official made clear that while Biden is focused on “getting jabs in the arms” of Americans, the United States recognizes the need to forge a strategy to assist its neighbors since national borders cannot seal it off from the pandemic.
“Once we actually get the pandemic under control, the economic recovery is one where we're going to have to eventually open our borders,” the U.S. official said. “But we cannot open our borders if Canada and Mexico have not similarly addressed the pandemic. So collaboration with Mexico is a top priority.”
While Biden has increased funding for international efforts to combat COVID-19, he could face political fallout if he moves too fast to ship vaccines to other countries when the United States is ramping up but still struggling to meet domestic needs.
Mexico's inoculation program has been delayed by slow shipments, despite agreements with international drugmakers meant to purchase doses for the country's 126 million people.
With  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) deliveries running behind schedule, Mexico has scrambled to fill the gap, landing initial deliveries of Russia's Sputnik V and China's Sinovac.
The government has given a first shot to just over 1.8 million people, or 1.4% of the population. Mexico has had more than 185,000 COVID-19 deaths and more than 2 million coronavirus infections.
Another source of U.S.-Mexican tension was a now-dropped U.S. drug investigation into former Mexican defense minister Salvador Cienfuegos. The U.S. arrest of Cienfuegos in October ruffled feathers in Mexico, which retaliated with restrictions on U.S. drug enforcement operations.
Asked whether Mexico had reduced security cooperation, the White House official said: “What we have found is that our collaboration and communication with Mexican law enforcement continues.""
Lopez Obrador has also told the United States not to meddle in Mexican energy policy, reflecting a view that the new U.S. administration would seek to defend investor interests as Mexico moves to change rules in favor of state power and oil companies.

Despite some investors’ view that the policy shift could violate the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal, the White House official said “it’s not clear whether there’s been a violation of USMCA” while insisting any differences could be worked out “within a context of respect.”

The ruling Nur Otan party has dominated the political scene in the former Soviet republic for almost three decades while opposition movements, sidelined and with no seats in parliament, mostly make themselves heard through public protests.
Supporters of two separate opposition groups rallied in different locations in Kazakhstan's biggest city, Almaty, and a few other big cities on Sunday to demand political reforms and the release of people they described as political prisoners.
A Reuters reporter saw police detain at least 50 people near a park in central Almaty. Dozens of people who rallied in another location could be seen completely surrounded by police in black balaclavas and riot gear.
""Nazarbayev, go away,"" chanted some protesters, referring to Kazakhstan's influential ex-President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has retained sweeping powers after resigning almost two years ago and helped to ensure the election of a hand-picked successor.

The authorities have issued a pre-emptive warning that Sunday's protests would be illegal, saying that the organisers failed to observe required legal procedures.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Forty-seven Hong Kong democrats and activists were charged on Sunday with conspiracy to commit subversion, in the largest single crackdown on the democratic opposition under a China-imposed national security law.
Sam Cheung, a young activist and a participant in an unofficial primary election last summer, was charged after reporting to a local police station, dressed in a black mask and accompanied by his wife. 
""Hong Kongers have a really tough time these days,"" he told reporters before entering the station. ""I hope everyone won't give up on Hong Kong ... (and) fight on.""
Cheung was arrested in a dawn raid along with more than 50 other democrats on Jan. 6 in the largest national security operation since the law's passage last June. 
They were accused of organising and participating in an unofficial ""primary election"" last July aimed at selecting the strongest candidates for a legislative council election.
The Hong Kong police said in a statement they had laid a charge against 47 persons with the single count. They will appear in court tomorrow morning, the statement added.
The democrats were detained at the time, questioned, and some had their mobile phones and computers confiscated, then released pending further investigations.
""My chance of bail won't be too great,"" wrote Benny Tai in an earlier social media post. He was also charged and accused by Chinese authorities of being a key tactician for the pro-democracy movement in the former British colony.
Those also called in by Hong Kong police include a group of younger ""resistance camp"" democratic activists including Lester Shum, Sam Cheung, Ventus Lau and Fergus Leung.
The democrats denounced the arrests as political persecution for the informal, peaceful poll that drew 600,000 votes in a city of 7.5 million.
A rights advocacy group, ""Power for Democracy"", that co-organised the primary elections, said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post it had disbanded.
The Hong Kong police say 99 individuals have been arrested for suspected violations of the security laws so far. 
Some of these have been denied bail, including media mogul and prominent China critic Jimmy Lai, despite protracted legal appeals.

The sweeping national security laws - seen by critics as a threat to Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy - punish acts of subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorism with possible life imprisonment.

Today, all four churches are either damaged or destroyed after Islamic State militants occupied the city from 2014-2017, desecrated many of the buildings and used them to run its administration, including as a jail and a court.
Air strikes as Iraqi forces tried to dislodge the extremist group in fierce fighting did the rest. Those walls still standing are scarred with bullet and shrapnel holes.
""It used to be a bit like the Jerusalem of the Nineveh plains,"" said Mosul and Akra's Chaldean Archbishop Najeeb Michaeel of ""Church Square"", the name given to the site that Pope Francis will visit on March 7 during his historic trip to Iraq.
Michaeel fondly recalled how, before the U.S. invasion in 2003, Iraqi Christians from different denominations would attend each other's services on religious festivals.
Those days are gone. Today just one of Mosul's surviving churches offers a weekly Sunday service to a Christian population that has dwindled to just a few dozen families from about 50,000 people.
Tolerated by former President Saddam Hussein but persecuted by al Qaeda and then Islamic State, Iraq's Christians number around 300,000, one fifth of the total before 2003.
Some are trickling back after Islamic State's defeat, but others still see little prospect in staying in Iraq and are looking to settle overseas.
MINES AND MEMORIES
A Syriac Catholic, Syriac Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox and Chaldean Catholic church are situated cheek-by-jowl in and around the dusty square. Now the area lies in ruins, as do other parts of the city.
The pope is due to hold prayers for the victims of war at Hosh al-Bieaa, known as Church Square in English, as part of a four-day trip starting on March 5, a visit Archbishop Michaeel described as highly symbolic and a message of hope.
""Where stones fell because of violence, there will always be life,"" he said.
Workmen have been busy cleaning up the site before Pope Francis arrives.
Funded by the United Arab Emirates, the restoration of the Syriac Catholic church of Al-Tahera is being carried out by UNESCO in collaboration with local partners and began in 2020.
Holding pictures of the church before its destruction, assistant site coordinator for UNESCO in Iraq, Anas Zeyad, pointed to delicate Syriac carvings on pieces of greyish alabaster stone referred to locally as ""Mosul marble"".
Damaged by Islamic State before its roof was shredded by air strikes, the church was used as a tribunal by the jihadist movement's religious police, Zeyad said.
The adjacent Armenian Orthodox church, distinguishable by its dome, remains closed off to the public.
""It has not been de-mined yet,"" Zeyad explained, pointing to the sealed door leading to the church that Islamic State commandeered as a prison.
""Nearly all churches in Mosul were used by Islamic State,"" Archbishop Michaeel said.
Standing next to a damaged piece of sculpted alabaster representing the Virgin Mary, Ali Salem, from Iraq's State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, said his team was reviewing many such artefacts to determine which could be repaired and used again.

""As a Muslim I am proud to help rebuild these churches,"" Zeyad said, adding that he hoped ""we see Christians come back to these places, so that we live together again as we have for centuries.""

Jalisco, where a former governor was shot dead in December, is one of the epicenters of Mexico's drug-related warfare, and home to the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG).
The state prosecutor's office said 10 men with gunshot wounds were found dead outside a home in Tonala, a municipality in the Guadalajara area, with another male body discovered inside. 
The injured woman and young man, who appeared to be a minor, were treated, the office said in a statement, but other details were not immediately known.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in late 2018 pledging to reduce entrenched violence, but he continues to grapple with mass killings and tens of thousands of homicides a year. 

In December, former Jalisco Governor Aristoteles Sandoval was shot dead in a restaurant in the beach town of Puerto Vallarta.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Exactly a year after New Zealand recorded its first coronavirus case, the biggest city of Auckland woke on Sunday to a second lockdown this month, as authorities try to rein in a cluster of the more contagious UK variant.
The seven-day lockdown of a population of nearly 2 million, announced late on Saturday by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, was prompted by the case of a person who had been infectious for a week but not in isolation.
""It is more than likely there will be additional cases in the community,"" Ardern told a televised news conference, although no new cases were recorded on Sunday. 
The move follows a three-day stay-at-home order in mid-February after the UK variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 emerged in New Zealand. About 14 cases are linked to the cluster.
""Despite our best efforts to date, recent cases have gone to work when they shouldn't have,"" Ardern said, promising police action over breaches of the rules on self-isolating.
Opposition leader Judith Collins urged tougher penalties for those who do not follow advice on isolation. ""No one wants to be yo-yoing in and out lockdown,"" Collins said in a statement. 
The new lockdown, part of Level 3 curbs, lets people leave home only for essential shopping and work, while public venues will stay shut. Curbs elsewhere in New Zealand are to be tightened to Level 2, setting limits on public gatherings.
The measures have disrupted several key events set for Auckland next week.
The America's Cup yacht race was postponed on Sunday and the Twenty20 International cricket match has been shifted to Wellington, to be played behind closed doors on Friday.
A popular Lantern Festival due to start next weekend has also been cancelled.
Social media users around the world expressed dismay at the lockdown of a large city over a single case, with one Twitter user writing, ""They are insane."" 
However, New Zealand's swift measures during the past year, combined with aggressive contact tracing and border closure, have been credited for its success in restraining the pandemic. 
With 5 million people, New Zealand has recorded just over 2,000 infections since the start of the pandemic, and 26 deaths.

1404,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2021 12:10AM ET</span>",El Salvador's Bukele poised for majority in mid-term votes,"By Nelson Renteria
SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - Salvadorans went to the polls on Sunday to vote in legislative and municipal elections that could give a broad victory to President Nayib Bukele's party, consolidating his overhaul of traditional politics. 
Opinion polls show that Bukele's party, New Ideas, could win more than half of the mayoral positions, and enough seats to hold at least a simple majority in Congress.
A two-thirds majority in Congress would let the party appoint high-level government officials, such as the attorney general and five of the 15 Supreme Court justices.
Bukele, a 39-year-old publicist and city mayor, took office in 2019 promising to root out corruption and upend the two-party politics - led by the Nationalist Republican Alliance and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front - that has dominated since the end of the civil war in 1992.
Despite garnering popularity by providing economic support during the pandemic and curbing homicides, Bukele has clashed with both the legislature and the Supreme Court, and rights groups say he has shown authoritarian tendencies.
Wilson Sandoval, coordinator of El Salvador's Anticorruption Legal Advisory Center, said it would be important to maintain a counterweight to the executive branch.
Voting Bukele would essentially take away an entity that can control the executive, Sandoval said, and so ""we are giving them a blank check so they can do whatever they want.""
Bukele has said his rivals are fearful because his policies threaten their privileges.

Polls opened at 7 a.m. (1300 GMT) and are slated to close at 5 p.m. (2300 GMT), with voters set to vote for 84 lawmakers and 262 mayors.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia received 300,000 doses of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC vaccine on Sunday, more than doubling the amount of all vaccines shipped to the country so far and allowing the government to ramp up its COVID-19 immunisation drive.
Mass vaccinations for Australia's 25 million people began on Monday after the arrival of a first batch of more than 142,000 doses of the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) vaccine.
""We will now be able to scale up the vaccination rollout to our priority groups, including our most vulnerable Australians and to our frontline border and health workers,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement. 
Up to 4 million Australians are expected to be inoculated by March, with Morrison being among a small group receiving the first round of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. 
Most people will be vaccinated with the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. The weekly number of administered doses is expected to reach 1 million by the end of March when CSL (OTC:CSLLY) Ltd begins to locally produce 50 million of the AstraZeneca doses. 
On Sunday, there were no new cases of the coronavirus recorded across Australia, the 30th such day so far in 2021. There have been no related deaths this year. 
Australia has fared better than most advanced economies thanks to swift border closures, high community compliance with public health measures and aggressive testing and tracing. It has reported fewer than 29,000 coronavirus infections and 909 COVID-19 deaths.
A February Ipsos poll conducted with the World Economic Forum in 15 countries showed that about three-quarters of Australians intend to take a COVID-19 vaccine.
On Saturday, about 200 people protested the vaccination drive in front of the office of Health Minister Greg Hunt. Hunt said on Sunday that some of the people opposing vaccinations were spreading ""false and clearly irresponsible"" views.

""Australians have put their shoulders to the cause,"" Hunt said about the people who got vaccinated. ""The enthusiasm with which it has been taken up is a tribute to Australians.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday called on the African Union and other international partners to help address a deepening crisis in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region as he condemned alleged atrocities in fighting there.
Blinken's statement suggested growing frustration with the response so far from Ethiopia and neighboring Eritrea to what America's top diplomat described as a ""worsening humanitarian crisis.""
His remarks came a day after Amnesty International released a report accusing Eritrean forces of killing hundreds of civilians in Tigray in a 24-hour period last year, an incident it described as a potential crime against humanity.
Eritrea rejected the accusations. 
""The United States is gravely concerned by reported atrocities and the overall deteriorating situation in the Tigray region of Ethiopia,"" Blinken said.
""We ask international partners, especially the African Union and regional partners, to work with us to address the crisis in Tigray, including through action at the U.N. and other relevant bodies.""
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's federal army ousted the former local ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), from the regional capital Mekelle in November, but low-level fighting has continued.
Thousands of people have died, hundreds of thousands have been forced from homes and there are shortages of food, water and medicine around the region of more than 5 million people.
Ethiopia and Eritrea have denied that Eritrean troops participated in the conflict, though dozens of witnesses, diplomats and an Ethiopian general have reported their presence.
Still, the state-run Ethiopian Human Rights Commission released a statement on Friday timed to coincide with the Amnesty report, saying preliminary investigations indicated that Eritrean soldiers had killed an unknown number of civilians in Axum, an ancient city in northern Ethiopia. It said the killings were in retaliation for an earlier attack by TPLF soldiers. 
Amnesty said Eritrean soldiers executed men and boys in the streets and engaged in extensive looting. 
Blinken noted Ethiopian commitments to full accountability, including international support for investigations into human rights abuses and to allowing unhindered humanitarian access. 
""The immediate withdrawal of Eritrean forces and Amhara regional forces from Tigray are essential first steps,"" Blinken said. 

""They should be accompanied by unilateral declarations of cessation of hostilities by all parties to the conflict and a commitment to permit unhindered delivery of assistance to those in Tigray.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Saturday said his administration would make an announcement on Saudi Arabia on Monday, following a U.S. intelligence report that found Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had approved the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The Biden administration has faced some criticism, notably an editorial in the Washington Post, that the president should have been tougher on the crown prince, who was not sanctioned despite being blamed for approving Khashoggi's murder.
Asked about punishing the crown prince, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, who is also known as MbS, Biden said: ""There will be an announcement on Monday as to what we are going to be doing with Saudi Arabia generally.""
Biden did not provide details.
But a White House official suggested no new significant steps were expected.
""The administration took a wide range of new actions on Friday. The president is referring to the fact that on Monday, the State Department will provide more details and elaborate on those announcements, not new announcements,"" the official said.
Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who wrote opinion columns for the Washington Post critical of MbS policies, was killed and dismembered by a team of operatives linked to the prince in the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.
The Saudi government, which has denied any involvement by the crown prince, on Friday issued a statement rejecting the U.S. report’s findings and repeating its previous statements that Khashoggi’s killing was a heinous crime by a rogue group.

Among the punitive steps the United States took on Friday was the imposition of a visa ban on some Saudis believed involved in the Khashoggi killing and sanctions on others, including a former deputy intelligence chief, which would freeze their U.S. assets and generally bar Americans from dealing with them.

Last week British Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out a phased plan to end England's latest COVID-19 lockdown, offering a ""cautious"" approach to try to prevent a return to wholesale restrictions that have hobbled the economy.
He said the first stage would prioritise schools returning on March 8 when only minimal socialising outdoors would be allowed.
The health ministry said rapid test kits would be made available to collect from Monday at more than 500 locations, or through workplace testing and local community testing services.
Secondary school and college students will be tested twice a week, receiving initial tests at school or college before moving to home testing.
Primary school children without symptoms will not be tested at school but parents will be encouraged to test their children at home.
“We know that one in three people with COVID-19 don’t have any symptoms, so targeted, regular testing will mean more positive cases are kept out of schools and colleges,” said health minister Matt Hancock.

The prevalence of COVID-19 infections in England is falling, with 1 in 145 people infected in the week ending Feb 19, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday.

""In a period of two years, we want to put an end to the serious problems of illegal immigration, drug trafficking and the movement of stolen vehicles,"" Abinader said in a presentation to Congress.
Construction of the border fence, whose cost has not been disclosed, will begin in the second half of 2021, Abinader said.
The barrier will include a double-fence in the ""most conflictive"" sections, along with motion sensors, facial recognition cameras and infrared systems, he added, speaking on the 177th anniversary of the country's independence from Haiti. 
According to government estimates, about 500,000 Haitian immigrants resided in the Dominican Republic as of 2018, along with tens of thousands of their children born in the Caribbean country. A large part of the Haitian community, which makes up about 5% of the total population, does not have residency permits. 

The announcement came a month after the government agreed to help Haiti provide identity documents to its citizens living in Dominican territory.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Myanmar's United Nations envoy in New York vowed to fight on Saturday after the junta fired him for urging countries to use ""any means necessary"" to reverse a Feb. 1 coup that ousted the nation's elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
""I decided to fight back as long as I can,"" Kyaw Moe Tun told Reuters on Saturday.
Myanmar state television announced on Saturday that Kyaw Moe Tun had been fired for betraying the country. 
However, the United Nations does not officially recognise the junta as Myanmar's new government as it has received no official notification of any change, said a U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, and so Kyaw Moe Tun remains Myanmar's U.N. ambassador, for now. 
""We have not received any communication concerning changes to the representation of Myanmar at the United Nations in New York,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, warned the 193-member U.N. General Assembly on Friday that no country should recognize or legitimize the Myanmar junta.
If the Myanmar junta, led by General Min Aung Hlaing, tries to seek international recognition by installing a new U.N. envoy it could set off a fight at the world body that could culminate with a vote at the General Assembly. 
The U.N. has previously had to address competing claims for representation at the world body.
In September 2011, the General Assembly approved a Libyan request to accredit envoys of the country's interim government. The move came after the United States, Russia, China and European nations had all recognized the new authorities. 
Kyaw Moe Tun told the United Nations on Friday that he was speaking for Suu Kyi's government and appealed for help to overturn ""the illegal and unconstitutional military coup."" Such an address - at odds with those in power in a country - is rare. 
Elected lawmakers ousted in the coup have formed a committee and Kyaw Moe Tun said that is the ""legitimate and duly elected government of Myanmar and must be recognized by the international community as such.""

Guterres has pledged to mobilize international pressure ""to make sure that this coup fails."" The Security Council has voiced concern over the state of emergency, but stopped short of condemning the coup due to opposition by Russia and China.

The New Haven Police Department said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Saturday that it had secured an arrest warrant charging Qinxuan Pan with murder, and that it would provide additional information on Monday. Pan remained at large, it said.
Kevin Jiang, a 26-year-old graduate student at the Yale School of the Environment, was shot and killed outside his car on Feb. 6, rattling the prestigious Ivy League school's campus, located about 80 miles (129 km) northeast of New York City.
Police had previously identified Pan, 29, as a ""person of interest"" and warned he could be armed and dangerous. He was enrolled in the electrical engineering and computer science department at MIT, itself an elite school not far from the suspect's last known address in Malden, Massachusetts.
The U.S. Marshals, which is assisting with the hunt for Pan, said on Feb. 11 that he was last seen that day in Brookhaven or Duluth, Georgia driving with family members.
Police have not disclosed a suspected motive in the killing. 
The murder took place near the apartment of Jiang's fiancee, Zion Perry, also a Yale graduate student, the New Haven Independent reported on Feb. 11.
Perry and Pan had crossed paths at MIT, where she earned her undergraduate degree, according to the newspaper, which published a photo of the two at a social gathering in March 2020. There is no evidence to suggest Perry and Pan had a romantic relationship, the Independent said. 
Perry did not immediately respond to an interview request.

Pablo Hasel, known for his anti-establishment lyrics, was arrested on Feb. 16 after failing to report to serve his sentence, prompting debate over freedom of expression and sparking sometimes violent protests in Barcelona and Madrid.
Hasel was convicted for lyrics and tweets that included references to Basque separatist group ETA, calling Spain's former king Juan Carlos a mafia boss and likening Spanish judges to Nazis. 
On Saturday evening police in Barcelona chased protesters after they hurled glass bottles, set fire to a police van and smashed the fronts of shops and banks. 
""Barricades and looting continue in the area of central Barcelona. For safety do not approach this area,"" Mossos d'Escuadra, the Catalan regional police, said on Twitter. 
Some ""hooded groups"" were looting along Barcelona's famous Rambla street, while firefighters were dealing with fires in shops and banks, police said, adding there were ""several banks with serious damage"". 
Ten people had been arrested for assaulting police officers, the Mossos d'Escuadra tweeted. 
Earlier, some 2,000 people wearing face masks and carrying banners marched through the city to call for Hasel's release. 
Hasel's case has put the spotlight on freedom of expression in Spain, prompting the government to announce it would relax free speech laws.

It has also highlighted the growing frustrations of many young Spaniards, from job insecurity to anger at Spain's political establishment.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania shipped its first donation of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine to neighbouring Moldova on Saturday to allow Moldova to start vaccinating frontline medical workers next week. 
Moldova and neighbouring Ukraine, two of Europe's poorest countries, have lagged behind the rest of the continent in the scramble for vaccines and welcomed donations from friendly governments.
In December, Romania's centrist president, Klaus Iohannis, said Bucharest would donate 200,000 doses of vaccine to Moldova, in a gesture of solidarity following the election of the pro-Western President Maia Sandu.
A former World Bank economist, Sandu defeated the pro-Moscow incumbent Igor Dodon in a presidential election, promising to fight endemic corruption and put Moldova's relations with the European Union back on track.
The eastern European country of 3.5 million, where the West and Russia vie for influence, has been rocked in recent years by instability and corruption scandals, including the disappearance of $1 billion from the banking system.
""Romania keeps its promise ... Today we deliver the first doses, 21,600 of AstraZeneca,"" Romania's Prime Minister Florin Citu wrote on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. ""It is the first batch of the 200,000 total that we offer as humanitarian aid. The rest will follow in the coming months.""
Sandu led a delegation to receive the vaccines at Chisinau airport as they arrived in a red air ambulance plane from Romania, which has close historical, linguistic and cultural ties to Moldova. 
""Thank you, Romania! Thank you, European Union!"" she wrote in a statement on Facebook.
Moldova's vaccine procurement has stirred a domestic political row as Dodon accused Sandu of trying to block the entry of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine. Sandu's office denied doing so. 

The government said this week it expects a first shipment of vaccines under the global COVAX scheme for poorer countries to arrive in Moldova by March 3.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli defence minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday his ""initial assessment"" was that Iran was responsible for an explosion on an Israeli-owned ship in the Gulf of Oman.
The ship, a vehicle-carrier named MV Helios Ray, suffered an explosion between Thursday and Friday morning. A U.S. defence official in Washington said the blast left holes above the waterline in both sides of the hull. The cause was not immediately clear and no casualties were reported.
""Iran is looking to hit Israeli infrastructure and Israeli citizens,"" Gantz told the public broadcaster Kan. ""The location of the ship in relative close proximity to Iran raises the notion, the assessment, that it is the Iranians."" 
""Right now, at an initial assessment level, given the proximity and the context - that is my assessment,"" Gantz said, adding a deeper investigation still had to be carried out. 
There was no immediate comment from Iranian officials.
The ship is owned by a Tel Aviv company called Ray Shipping through a company registered in the Isle of Man, according to a U.N. shipping database.
Israeli Channel 13 News said defence officials believed the Iranian navy had launched a precision strike to avoid casualties, firing two missiles at a part of the ship that if damaged would not have sunk the vessel. 
It added an Israeli delegation was en route to Dubai, where the ship was docked, to investigate. 
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the report. 
Kan named the owner as Rami Ungar and quoted him on Friday as saying: ""The damage is two holes, diameter approximately 1.5 metres, but it is not yet clear to us if this was caused by missile fire or mines that were attached to the ship.""
Iran said in November it would make a ""calculated"" response to the killing of its top nuclear scientist, which it blamed on Israel.
Tensions have risen in the Gulf region since the United States reimposed sanctions on Iran in 2018 after then-president Donald Trump withdrew Washington from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major powers.

Washington has blamed Iran for a number of attacks on shipping in strategic Gulf waters, notably on four vessels, including two Saudi oil tankers, in May 2019. Iran has denied carrying out those attacks.

1417,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2021 01:11PM ET</span>",Cuba approves animal welfare law after civil society pressure,"By Nelson Acosta
HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba has approved a long called-for decree on animal welfare in what some rights activists are hailing as an unusual triumph of civil society in the Communist-run country where animal sacrifice and cock and dog fighting remain commonplace. 
The move aims to prevent cruelty and raise awareness about the need to protect animals, marking a cultural advance in a nation where strays abound and the coast is strewn with chicken carcasses sacrificed in religious rituals.
Although details remain scarce, the new legislation will become clear within 90 days when it is published in the Official Gazette.
""Cuba was one of the few countries in Latin America that didn't have an animal welfare law so to have one now is an immense joy,"" Fernando Gispert, President of the Havana branch of the Cuban Association of Veterinary Medicine. 
The Agriculture Ministry said the decree, which regulates scientific experiments, the handling of strays and veterinarian practices amongst other matters, responded to concerns aired in a nationwide debate over the new constitution three years ago.
For decades though, animal rights activists have called for legislation on animal welfare, largely through official channels in the one-party state where public dissent is frowned upon. 
In recent years, frustrated with the slow pace of change, a younger generation has opted to exert pressure on authorities with marches, protests in public spaces and social media campaigns.
""This has set an example for all communities that want their voice to be heard,"" said Beatriz Batista, 23, who has become one of the leaders of the movement. ""You have to pressure, pressure.""
The approval of the decree underscores the extent to which Cuban civil society has strengthened of late, particularly thanks to the rollout of internet which has increased the flow of information and allowed citizens to better mobilize, analysts say.
In a country where demanding anything of the government outside official channels is frowned upon as weakening the common front against old Cold War foe the United States, it is unsurprising that a topic not deemed to be particularly sensitive should be the one to galvanize many Cubans, they say.
""While important, this decree law is a relatively low hanging fruit that both the government and civil society activists can celebrate as having picked in a tense collaboration/standoff,"" said Cuba expert Ted Henken at Baruch College in New York.
ANIMAL SACRIFICE
The growing voice of activists has led to a proliferation of citizen initiatives to rescue and sterilize strays and to clean the coasts and river beds of the remains of animal sacrifices.
""We are fighting for dead animals not to be left out in public spaces,"" said José Manuel Pérez, president of the officially recognized Yoruba Cultural Association of Cuba.
Perez said the blood of sacrificed animals had spiritual significance and sacrifices had increased of late due to a growth in believers but also due to malpractice.
The ministry said in a statement on its website that sacrifices would not be outlawed but the decree would stipulate they be conducted in a ""compassionate and rapid manner, avoiding pain and stress,"" establishing some broad criteria.
Supporters of cock fighting, often hosted in official arenas, say it is part of Cuban, and more broadly Caribbean, culture. Activists say it should at the very least be strictly regulated to avoid unnecessary cruelty. 

To those worrying the decree may not be far-reaching enough, Cuban independent journalist Monica Baro said in a widely shared Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post: ""It is better to have a minimal framework of legal protection than nothing.""

1418,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2021 01:00PM ET</span>","As Mexico's largest migrant camp empties, new tents spring up along border","By Dave Graham (NYSE:GHM), Mimi Dwyer and Ted Hesson
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities hope most of the asylum seekers living in a major encampment on the border will be allowed to enter the United States by the end of next week, according to a Mexican government source.
The migrant camp in Matamoros, Mexico, just across the river from Brownsville, Texas, is currently home to just under 700 migrants, according to the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR). The majority are asylum seekers who have been waiting in Mexico as their cases wind through U.S. courts under a program implemented by former President Donald Trump.
One week ago, President Joe Biden's administration began permitting members of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program to enter the United States to pursue their court cases.
UNHCR spokeswoman Silvia Garduño said 27 people crossed the border from Mexico on Thursday and 100 on Friday, and that the agency hopes to continue this pace in the coming days.
The agency, along with the International Organization for Migration, is in charge of the logistics of registering and transporting migrants from the camp to the United States.
The Mexican government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the goal was for 500 migrants in the Matamoros camp to enter the United States by the end of next week.
Mexican authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) referred Reuters to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) statement that said the registration process ""will be done as quickly as possible.""
In Matamoros, asylum seekers expressed optimism.
""We've just received news that tomorrow we're leaving!"" said Honduran asylum seeker Josue Cornejo in a video recorded inside the camp on Friday evening, which also shows his wife and daughters wiping away tears.
But as one tent city begins to empty in northeastern Mexico, another has sprung up on the other side of the country. In Tijuana, migrants encouraged by the news that some asylum seekers were being allowed to enter the United States have begun to camp out near the El Chaparral port of entry, across the border from San Diego, California. Advocates say about 50 tents have been put up in recent days.
Biden, a Democrat, is balancing pressure from immigration advocates to unwind the hardline immigration policies of his predecessor with concerns about rising numbers of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.
To handle an anticipated rise in crossings, CBP said in a statement on Friday that it planned to open a facility in Eagle Pass, Texas.
Plans for the new facility come after CBP announced on Feb. 9 the opening of another temporary facility in Donna, Texas, to handle border processing while the agency's permanent center in McAllen is renovated.
Under U.S. law, children who arrive at the border without parents or legal guardians have to be transferred quickly out of border patrol facilities and into government-run shelters overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
Separately, HHS is also scrambling to cope with the influx of new arrivals by opening emergency shelters and trying to speed releases of migrant kids to sponsors in the United States.
""There are no good choices here,"" Biden told reporters on Friday. ""The only other options are to send kids back, which is what the prior administration did.""

Most migrants caught at the border, including families and individual adult asylum seekers, are still being rapidly expelled at the border under a Trump-era health rule in place since last March.

1419,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2021 12:55PM ET</span>",Spanish government says all cattle on pariah ship should be killed,"MADRID (Reuters) - More than 850 cows that have spent months on a ship in the Mediterranean are no longer fit for transport and should be killed, Spain's Agriculure Ministry said on Saturday, confirming an earlier Reuters report. 
The cows were kept in what an animal rights activist called ""hellish"" conditions on the Karim Allah, which docked in the southeastern Spanish port of Cartagena on Thursday after struggling to find a buyer for the cattle during the past two months.
The animals were rejected by several countries over fears they had bovine bluetongue virus. The insect-borne virus causes lameness and haemorrhaging among cattle. Bluetongue does not affect humans. 
A confidential veterinarians' report seen by Reuters on Friday concluded that the animals had suffered from the lengthy journey and euthanasia would be the best solution for their health and welfare (nL1N2KW3EG). 
The report did not say if the cattle had bluetongue disease.
In a statement on Saturday the Agriculture Ministry confirmed the report's findings and said the ship's owners should kill the cattle. 
""They should proceed to isolate and slaughter the animals in accordance with the applicable regulations and, in the case of not doing so, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will do it in a subsidiary way.""
Miquel Masramon, a lawyer representing the ship owner Talia Shipping Line, called for samples taken from the animals and impounded by authorities on Thursday to be returned so they could be tested for bluetongue. 
""It (the report) does not mention any serious diseases that explain why these animals must be destroyed,"" he said. 
The vessel originally left Cartagena to deliver the cattle to Turkey. But authorities there blocked the shipment and suspended live animal imports from Spain, fearing bluetongue infection. 

That rejection turned the ship, registered in Lebanon, into an international pariah, as several more countries refused it entry.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2021 12:50PM ET</span>",Analysis: U.S. seeks to put Saudi crown prince in his place - for now,"By Aziz El Yaakoubi and Marwa Rashad
DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may have been spared direct punishment after a U.S. intelligence report implicated him in the killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but he has not emerged unscathed.
The declassified report, based on CIA intelligence, concludes that the prince approved an operation to ""capture or kill"" Khashoggi, who was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.
President Joe Biden's decision to publish a report that his predecessor Donald Trump had set aside brings with it a broad refocusing of Washington's stance on dealing with the kingdom, on its human rights record, and on its lucrative arms purchases.
By pointing the finger so publicly at Prince Mohammed, the kingdom's ruler in practice but not in name, Washington has also made it harder for its Western allies to deal with him directly.
But while it may want to cut the 35-year-old crown prince down to size, Washington knows it can ill afford to break entirely with its oldest Arab ally and the main counterweight to Iran in the region.
""What we've done ... is not to rupture the relationship but to recalibrate it to be more in line with our interests and our values,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters.
Elisabeth Kendall, senior research fellow in Arabic & Islamic studies at the University of Oxford, said the report was ""supremely embarrassing for Saudi Arabia"" and ""places other world leaders in the awkward position of having to decide if, when and how to continue dealing with the crown prince"".
HUMAN RIGHTS IN FOCUS
Prince Mohammed has denied any involvement in Khashoggi's killing, for which eight people were jailed in Saudi Arabia last year, but has said he bears ultimate responsibility because it happened on his watch.
The U.S. administration imposed sanctions on 76 Saudis, including close collaborators of the prince, sparing the crown prince himself.
But Biden has indicated he will look more widely at human rights in Saudi Arabia, where the prince has crushed dissent and sidelined or even imprisoned rivals, including close relatives, in his drive to consolidate power.
Biden said on Friday he had made it clear, in a call with King Salman, that killings of political opponents were not acceptable and that human rights abuses must be tackled.
Already, two Saudi political activists with U.S. citizenship have been freed on bail pending trials. Prominent women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul was also freed after nearly three years in prison, where her relatives said she had been tortured, something the authorities denied.
A source familiar with Riyadh's thinking said both moves were ""part of leverage for a new relationship with the Biden administration"".
The call to King Salman was evidence of Biden's stated intention to revert to standard protocol by communicating with the ruler, not his heir.
""It is just symbolic enough to show that Trump put Prince Mohammed in a position that he doesn’t deserve, not one that fits him, and it is time to put him back where he belongs,"" said a Western diplomat in Riyadh.
ARMS FOR OIL
Biden may well go beyond the symbolic, as his administration has signalled that it may cancel arms sales to one of its biggest buyers if they pose human rights concerns, and limit future deals to ""defensive"" weapons only.
Washington has also lifted Trump's ban on dealing with the Iranian-backed Houthi movement that ousted a Saudi-supported government in Yemen and is now at war with Saudi forces and their allies.
The war has left millions destitute and near starvation, and Washington wants it to end. 
Yet Biden must still tread carefully. King Salman is 85 and infirm, and his son may be in charge of the world's top oil exporter - and an important ally against their common enemy, Iran - for decades. 
Neil Quilliam, associate fellow at the Chatham House think tank, said the report constituted ""a strong rap on the knuckles"" - but that, even with ties on a more formal footing, Washington would remain the kingdom's main defence and security provider. 
The alliance dates back to 1945, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt met Saudi King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud on a U.S. Navy cruiser and promised military protection in exchange for access to Saudi oil reserves.

One Western diplomat in the Gulf said simply: ""Joint interests will not be at risk.""

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2021 11:15AM ET</span>",Lebanese rally to back church leader's neutrality calls,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Hundreds of Lebanese gathered at the seat of the Maronite church on Saturday to support calls by its leader for the country to be neutral in regional conflicts as a way to lead it out of political and economic crisis.
Lebanon has been in financial meltdown since 2019 and feuding politicians have been unable to form a government since the last one quit in the aftermath of an Aug. 4 explosion in the capital, leaving the country rudderless.
Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai has repeatedly urged political rivals to agree a new administration, and recently called for a U.N.-sponsored international conference to help break the deadlock.
""You came from all over Lebanon ... to support two things: neutrality and an international conference for Lebanon under the auspices of the United Nations. In one word you came here to save Lebanon,"" Rai, who is Lebanon's most senior Christian cleric, told the crowd at the church's seat in Bkirki.
""Through an international conference we want to announce the neutrality of Lebanon so that it does not return to become a victim of conflicts and wars and divisions,"" he said. ""There are no two states in one land and no two armies in one state.""
Rai did not specifically refer to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, but several people in the crowd shouted ""Iran, get out"" in reference to the Shi'ite group.
Heavily armed Hezbollah has supported Iran in its power struggle with Sunni-led Arab Gulf states in the region.
Opponents of the group say its alliance with Tehran has led Gulf Arabs - who once supported Lebanon - to steer clear, closing off an important source of aid.
Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri was given the task of forming a government in October but is struggling to cobble together a cabinet to share power with all Lebanese parties, including Hezbollah.

Hariri said earlier in February there was no way out of the crisis without the support of Arab countries.

Washington said its strikes on positions of the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah paramilitary group along the Iraq border were in response to the rocket attacks on U.S. targets in Iraq.
Western officials and some Iraqi officials have blamed those attacks on Iran-backed groups. 
However, Tehran has denied any involvement. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday condemned the U.S. strikes as ""illegal and a violation of Syria's sovereignty"" in a meeting with his visiting Iraqi counterpart Fuad Hussein, Iran's state media reported.
""Zarif said some recent attacks and incidents in Iraq are suspect, and could be designed to disrupt Iran-Iraq relations and Iraq's security and stability,"" the media reports said. 
""We emphasize the need for the Iraqi government to find the perpetrators of these incidents,"" Zarif was quoted as saying.
Hussein gave assurances that ""Baghdad will not allow incidents in this country to be used to disrupt the excellent relations between the two countries"", state media reported. 
Progress has been made in talks on Iran's frozen funds and Baghdad would facilitate Tehran's access to its funds, Hussein added. Some $6 billion in Iranian funds have been blocked in Iraq because of U.S. sanctions. 
Iran’s top security official, Ali Shamkhani, met Hussein earlier and said Friday's U.S. air strikes encouraged terrorism in the region.
Hussein is in Iran ""to discuss regional developments, including ways to balance relations and avoid tension and escalation"" with Iranian officials, according to an Iraqi foreign ministry statement. 
An Iraqi militia official close to Iran said the U.S. strikes killed one fighter and wounded four. U.S. officials said they were limited in scope to show President Joe Biden’s administration would act firmly while trying to avoid a big regional escalation. 

Washington and Tehran are seeking maximum leverage in attempts to save Iran’s nuclear deal reached with world powers in 2015 but abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, after which regional tensions soared.

1423,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2021 10:26AM ET</span>",Tunisia's main party holds huge rally as government row grows,"By Tarek Amara
TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia's biggest political party assembled an immense crowd of supporters in the capital on Saturday in a show of strength that could fuel a dispute between the president and the prime minister.
In one of the biggest demonstrations since Tunisia's 2011 revolution, tens of thousands of Ennahda supporters marched through central Tunis chanting ""The people want to protect institutions!"" and ""The people want national unity!"".
The dispute has played out against a grim backdrop of economic anxiety, disillusionment with democracy and competing reform demands from foreign lenders and the UGTT, the powerful main labour union, as debt repayments loom. 
Ennahda, a moderate Islamist party led by Parliament Speaker Rached Ghannouchi, has backed Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi in a standoff with President Kais Saied over a cabinet reshuffle.
Banned before the revolution, it has been a member of most governing coalitions since then and, although its share of the vote has fallen in recent years, it still holds the most seats in parliament. 
""Nationalists, Islamists, democrats and communists,"" Ghannouchi told the crowd, ""we were gathered together during the dictatorship ... and we must unite again.""
The most recent election, in 2019, delivered a fragmented parliament while propelling Saied, an independent, to the presidency. 
When the government collapsed after only five months in office, Saied nominated Mechichi as prime minister.
But they soon fell out, and Mechichi turned for support to the two biggest parties - Ennahda and jailed media mogul Nabil Karoui's Heart of Tunisia. 
Last month, Mechichi changed 11 ministers in a reshuffle seen as replacing Saied's allies with those of Ennahda and Heart of Tunisia. The president has refused to swear four of them in, however.
Meanwhile, demonstrators protesting last month against inequality and police abuses focused most of their anger on Mechichi and Ennahda.
Ennahda billed Saturday's march as ""in support of democracy"", but it was widely seen as an effort to mobilise popular opposition to Saied - raising the spectre of competing protest movements.
""This is a strong message that all the people want dialogue and national unity,"" Fethi Ayadi, a senior Ennahda official, told Reuters.
To add to the tensions, demands by foreign lenders for spending cuts, which could lead to unpopular reductions in state programmes, are opposed by the UGTT.
Tunisia's 2021 budget forecasts borrowing needs of 19.5 billion Tunisian dinars ($7.2 billion), including about $5 billion in foreign loans.

But Tunisia's credit rating has fallen since the coronavirus pandemic began, and market concerns about its ability to raise funds are reflected in sharp price rises for Tunisian credit default swaps - insurance against default on its debt. ($1 = 2.7 Tunisian dinars)

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh is under ""no obligation"" to shelter 81 Rohingya Muslim refugees adrift for almost two weeks on the Andaman Sea and being assisted by neighbouring India, said Bangladesh foreign minister A.K. Abdul Momen.
India's coast guard found the 81 survivors and eight dead crammed onto a crippled fishing boat and were trying to arrange for Bangladesh to take them, Indian officials said on Friday. 
But Momen told Reuters late on Friday that Bangladesh expects India, the closest country, or Myanmar, the Rohingyas' country of origin, to accept them.
""They are not Bangladesh nationals and in fact, they are Myanmar nationals. They were found 1,700 km (1,100 miles) away from the Bangladesh maritime territory and therefore, we have no obligation to take them,"" said Momen, who is in the United States.
""They were located 147 km (91 miles) away from Indian territory, 324 km (201 miles) away from Myanmar,"" he said by phone, adding other countries and organisations should take care of the refugees.
Indian foreign ministry officials did not respond to requests for comment.
External Affairs Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said on Thursday that India was ""in discussions with the Government of Bangladesh to ensure their safe and secure repatriation."" 
India's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on whether it would accept the refugees onto Indian soil. 
One senior Indian official, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to discuss the matter with media, said India planned to help the refugees with food and water, but it was not planning to take them ashore. 
New Delhi did not sign the 1951 Refugee Convention, which spells out refugee rights and state responsibilities to protect them. Nor does it have a law protecting refugees, though it currently hosts more than 200,000, including some Rohingya.
More than 1 million Rohingya refugees from predominantly Buddhist Myanmar are living in teeming camps in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, including tens of thousands who fled after Myanmar's military conducted a deadly crackdown in 2017.
Traffickers often lure Rohingya refugees with promises of work in Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia.
The United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, expressed alarm this week over the missing boat.
India on Thursday said around 47 of the occupants of the boat are in possession of ID cards issued to them by the UNHCR office in Bangladesh, stating that they are displaced Myanmar nationals.
NO 'GLOBAL CONTRACT' TO AID REFUGEES
The refugees have been drifting in international waters after leaving southern Bangladesh on Feb. 11 in the hope of reaching Malaysia.
On Saturday, they were under the aid and surveillance of India as officials were holding talks to return them to Bangladesh, said the senior Indian official who is not authorised to speak to the media.
The boat, which sailed from the massive Cox's Bazar refugee camp, was carrying 56 women, eight girls, 21 men and five boys.
Many of the survivors, according to Indian officials, were sick and suffering from extreme dehydration, having run out of food and water after the boat's engine failed four days into their journey.
""Has Bangladesh been given the global contract and responsibility to take and rehabilitate all the Rohingya or boat people of the world?"" Momen said. ""No, not at all."" 
Momen said the UNHCR should also take responsibility as many people on the boat hold ID cards from the UNHCR office in Bangladesh.
""If (the refugees) are UNHCR card holders, why did they allow traffickers to take their card holders to adrift on the high sea leading to death?""

UNHCR officials were not immediately reachable for comment.

CARTAGENA, Spain (Reuters) - More than 850 cows that spent months aboard a ship wandering across the Mediterranean are not fit for transport anymore and should be killed, according to a confidential report by Spanish government veterinarians seen by Reuters.
The cows were kept in what an animal rights activist called ""hellish"" conditions on the Karim Allah, which docked in the southeastern Spanish port of Cartagena on Thursday after struggling to find a buyer for the cattle during the past two months.
The beasts were rejected by several countries over fears they had bovine bluetongue virus. The insect-borne virus causes lameness and haemorrhaging among cattle. Bluetongue does not affect humans.
The veterinarians' report concluded that the animals had suffered from the lengthy journey. Some of them were unwell and not fit for transport outside of the European Union, nor should they be allowed in the EU. Euthanasia would be the best solution for their health and welfare, it said.
The report did not say if the cattle had bluetongue disease.
""It is not even mentioned, which is very surprising,"" said Miquel Masramon, a lawyer representing the ship owner Talia Shipping Line. The ship is registered in Lebanon, according to VesselFinder. 
""My impression is that they will definitely go ahead with the slaughter and destruction of the animals and it'll be difficult for us to prevent it,"" he said.
Masramon said he would push for the return of blood samples taken from the animals and impounded by authorities on Thursday to be released and tested ""to prove if there is any bluetongue"".
The Agriculture Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It said earlier on Friday that it would make appropriate decisions after analysing information from the inspection.
The vessel originally left Cartagena to deliver the cattle to Turkey. But authorities there blocked the shipment and suspended live animal imports from Spain, fearing bluetongue infection. 
That rejection turned the ship into an international pariah. Several countries refused it entry even to replenish animal feed, forcing the cows to go several days with just water. 
The cows likely have severe health problems after their ""hellish"" crossing, said animal rights activist Silvia Barquero, director of the Igualdad Animal NGO. 
""What has happened to the waste produced by all these animals for two months? We are sure they are in unacceptable sanitary conditions,"" Barquero told Reuters.
The Agriculture Ministry's experts counted 864 animals alive on board. Twenty-two cows died at sea, with two corpses still aboard. The remains of the others that died were chopped up and thrown overboard during the journey, the report said.
Ownership of the cattle is unclear. The exporter, World Trade, said it is not responsible because it sold the animals, Masramon said. Reuters has been unable to reach World Trade for comment.
A second ship, the ElBeik, also set sail from Spain in December with a cargo of nearly 1,800 cows. It is currently moored off the Turkish Cypriot port of Famagusta.

Schools have become targets for mass kidnappings for ransom in northern Nigeria by armed groups, many of whom carry guns and ride motorcycles.
On Feb. 17, 27 students, three staff and 12 members of their families were abducted by an armed gang who stormed the Government Science secondary school in the Kagara district of Niger state, overwhelming the school's security detail. One boy was killed during the raid.
After their release, boys were seen by a Reuters witness walking with armed security through a dusty village, some struggling to stand and asking for water. A government official said the boys were aged between 15 and 18.
""The Abducted Students, Staff and Relatives of Government Science Collage Kagara have regained their freedom and have been received by the Niger State Government,"" Governor Abubakar Sani Bello said in a tweet. 
The release of the schoolboys comes just a day after the raid on a school in Zamfara state where gunmen seized 317 girls.
""As we welcome the news of the release of the abducted Kagara students, I urge government to expedite action on the release and safe return of the kidnapped students of Government Girls Secondary School Jangebe,"" Peter  Hawkins  (NASDAQ:HWKN), UNICEF's Nigeria representative, said.
The recent attacks have raised concern about rising violence by armed gangs and Islamist insurgents. Jihadist group Boko Haram carries out abductions in Nigeria's turbulent northeast, as does a branch of Islamic State. 
The unrest has become a political problem for President Muhammadu Buhari, a retired general and former military ruler who has faced mounting criticism in recent months over high profile attacks by the gangs known locally as ""bandits"".
Buhari replaced his long-standing military chiefs this month amid worsening violence in Nigeria.
In December, gunmen raided a school in northwestern Katsina state and kidnapped nearly 350 boys, who were subsequently rescued by security forces. 
Violence and insecurity have compounded the economic challenges faced by citizens in Africa's most populous country and top oil exporter, which is struggling to cope with a fall in revenues due to a slump in crude prices in addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The most high profile school kidnapping was that of more than 270 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram from the town of Chibok in 2014. Around 100 of them remain missing.

The almost perfectly preserved four-wheeled carriage made of iron, bronze and tin was found near the stables of an ancient villa at Civita Giuliana, around 700 metres (yards) north of the walls of ancient Pompeii.
Massimo Osanna, the outgoing director of the Pompeii archaeological site, said the carriage was the first of its kind discovered in the area, which had so far yielded functional vehicles used for transport and work, but not for ceremonies.
""This is an extraordinary discovery that advances our understanding of the ancient world,"" Osanna said, adding that the carriage would have ""accompanied festive moments for the community, (such as) parades and processions"".
The culture ministry called it ""a unique find, without any precedent in Italy"".
Pompeii, 23 km (14 miles) southeast of Naples, was home to about 13,000 people when it was buried under ash, pumice pebbles and dust as it endured the force of an eruption equivalent to many atomic bombs.
About two-thirds of the 66-hectare (165-acre) ancient town has been uncovered. The ruins were not discovered until the 16th century and organised excavations began in about 1750.
""Pompeii continues to amaze us with its discoveries and it will do so for many years, with 20 hectares still to be dug up,"" said Culture Minister Dario Franceschini.

BEDFORD, England (Reuters) - A military guard of honor and Royal Air Force fly-past marked the funeral on Saturday of Captain Sir Tom Moore, the World War Two veteran who raised millions of pounds for Britain's health service during the coronavirus pandemic.
Moore died on Feb. 2 after contracting COVID-19.
In the run up to his 100th birthday last year, he had been challenged to walk 100 laps of his garden to raise a modest 1,000 pounds.
By the time he finished, on April 16, he was being willed on by millions in Britain and beyond, and the total raised was heading toward 39 million pounds ($54 million).
Moore was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in recognition of his efforts, while the White House said after his death that he had ""inspired millions through his life and his actions"".
In line with current pandemic restrictions, the funeral at Bedford Crematorium in central England was attended by just eight members of Moore's immediate family. It was televised, however.
Six soldiers from the Yorkshire Regiment, the modern incarnation of Moore's wartime regiment, carried his coffin, an honor guard of 14 fired three volleys into the air, and a World War Two-era Douglas C-47 Dakota performed a fly-past.
The service featured Moore’s own recording of ""You’ll Never Walk Alone"", which topped the charts last year, Vera Lynn's wartime anthem ""The White Cliffs of Dover (NYSE:DOV)"", and ""Smile"", recorded specially for the family by Michael Buble.
There were also readings from his daughters, grandsons and granddaughter before his coffin was committed and Frank Sinatra's ""My Way"" was played.
The service ended with the regiment's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Tim Exton, reading the Kohima Epitaph before a bugler played the Last Post.
Once COVID-19 restrictions permit, the family plan to inter Moore's ashes in Yorkshire, northern England, where he will rest with his parents and grandparents.

1430,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2021 05:46AM ET</span>","Myanmar police launch most extensive crackdown; one woman dead, media say","(Reuters) - Police in Myanmar launched their most sweeping crackdown in three weeks of protests against military rule on Saturday in towns and cities across the country, with media reports of a woman shot dead and dozens of people detained.
The violence came after Myanmar's U.N. envoy urged the United Nations to use ""any means necessary"" to stop the Feb. 1 coup.
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army seized power and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and much of her party leadership, alleging fraud in a November election her party won in a landslide.
Uncertainty has grown over Suu Kyi's whereabouts, as the independent Myanmar Now website on Friday quoted officials of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party as saying she had been moved this week from house arrest to an undisclosed location.
The coup has brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets and drawn condemnation from Western countries, with some imposing limited sanctions.
Police were out in force in cities and towns from early on Saturday in their most determined bid to stamp out the protests.
In the main city of Yangon, police took up positions at usual protest sites and detained people as they congregated, witnesses said. Several journalists were detained.
Confrontations developed as more people came out to demonstrate despite the police operation.
Three domestic media outlets said a woman was shot and killed in the central town of Monwya. The circumstances of the shooting were not clear and police were not immediately available for comment.
Earlier, a protester in the town said police had fired water cannon as they surrounded a crowd.
""They used water cannon against peaceful protesters - they shouldn't treat people like that,"" Aye Aye Tint told Reuters.
A big crowd of protesters later surged through town streets chanting defiance, an activist video feed showed. One protester told Reuters the crowd was demanding the release of people detained by the security forces.
Junta leader General Min Aung Hlaing has said authorities were using minimal force. Nevertheless, at least three protesters had died over the days of turmoil up to Saturday. The army says a policeman was killed in earlier violence.
In Yangon, crowds came out to chant and sing, then scattered into side streets and slipped into buildings as police advanced, firing tear gas, setting off stun grenades and shooting guns into the air, witnesses said.
Some protesters threw up barricades across streets. Crowds eventually thinned but police in Yangon were still chasing groups and firing into the air in the late afternoon, witnesses said. Numerous people were seen detained and some beaten through the day.
Similar scenes played out in the second city of Mandalay and other towns from north to south, witnesses and media said. Among those detained in Mandalay was Win Mya Mya, one of two Muslim members of parliament for the NLD, media said.
'PREVAIL'
At the U.N. General Assembly, Myanmar's Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun said he was speaking on behalf of Suu Kyi's government and appealed for ""any means necessary to take action against the Myanmar military and to provide safety and security for the people"".
""We need further strongest possible action from the international community to immediately end the military coup ... and to restore the democracy,"" he said.
Delivering his final words in Burmese, the career diplomat raised the three-finger salute of pro-democracy protesters and announced, ""Our cause will prevail.""
Reuters was not immediately able to contact the army for comment.
U.N. Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews said he was overwhelmed as he watched the ambassador's ""act of courage"".
""It's time for the world to answer that courageous call with action,"" Andrews said on Twitter.
China's envoy did not criticise the coup and said the situation was an internal Myanmar affair, adding that China supported a diplomatic effort by southeast Asian countries to find a solution.
In more bad news for the generals who have traditionally shrugged off diplomatic pressure, Australia's Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum Ltd said it was cutting its presence in Myanmar over concern about rights violations and violence.
""Woodside supports the people of Myanmar,"" the company said.
Nobel Peace laureate Suu Kyi, 75, spent nearly 15 years under house arrest during military rule. She faces charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios and of violating a natural disaster law by breaching coronavirus protocols.
A lawyer for her, Khin Maung Zaw, told Reuters he had also heard that she had been moved from her home in the capital, Naypyitaw, but could not confirm it. Authorities did not respond to a request for comment.

The lawyer said he had been given no access to Suu Kyi ahead of her next hearing on Monday and he was concerned about her access to justice and legal counsel.

YANSHUI, Taiwan (Reuters) - Firecrackers lit up the skies on Friday night as Taiwanese celebrated a cacophonous traditional festival in the island's south, pared back this year due to the coronavirus pandemic but still allowed to go ahead due to Taiwan's low case numbers. 
The Beehive Fireworks Festival in Yanshui, close to Taiwan's old capital of Tainan, is renowned for its noisy and fiery atmosphere - participants wear motorcycle helmets and thick coats to avoid being injured as the streets are bombarded with fireworks and firecrackers.
Held to coincide with Lantern Festival, which marks the final day of the Lunar New Year celebrations, the event had been in doubt due to government worries about COVID-19, though Taiwan has fewer than 30 active cases.
But the Tainan government allowed it to go ahead, albeit with fewer revellers permitted to attend.
Weng Tsai-chin, chairman of the Yanshui Wu Temple, said in previous years up to 200,000 came to the festival, with the number dramatically smaller this year.
""Although you don't see too many people here, there are lots of people watching the live stream at night,"" he said.
The festival gets its name from the thousands of rockets which are set off from decks along the street at the same time, creating a huge roar that is supposed to sound like bees.
The festival originated in the late 19th century during a cholera epidemic, when fireworks were set off to drive away the sickness, with residents appealing to the god of war to help them in their time of crisis.

""Many people supported the festival to be continued this year and we cannot stop holding the festival,"" said resident Ah Hsien, 18. ""We especially need to have it now during the prevention of the epidemic. This is a culture to eliminate the plague.""

SANAA/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ahmadiya Juaidi's eyes are wide as she drinks a nutrition shake from a large orange mug, her thin fingers grasping the handle. Her hair is pulled back and around her neck hangs a silver necklace with a heart and the letter A. 
Three weeks ago the 13-year-old weighed just nine kilograms (20 pounds) when she was admitted to al-Sabeen hospital in Yemen's capital Sanaa with malnutrition that sickened her for at least the past four years. Now she weighs 15 kilograms.
""I am afraid when we go back to the countryside her condition will deteriorate again due to lack of nutritional food. We have no income,"" her older brother, Muhammad Abdo Taher Shami, told Reuters.
They are among some 16 million Yemenis - more than half the population of the Arabian Peninsula country - that the United Nations says are going hungry. Of those, five million are on the brink of famine, U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock warns.
On Monday the United Nations hopes to raise some $3.85 billion at a virtual pledging event to avert what Lowcock says would be a large-scale ""man-made"" famine, the worst the world will have seen for decades. 
More than six years of war in Yemen - widely seen as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran - have sent the impoverished country spiraling into what the United Nations describes as the world's largest humanitarian crisis. 
Some 80% of Yemenis need help, with 400,000 children under the age of five severely malnourished, according to U.N. data. For much of its food, the country relies on imports that have been badly disrupted over the years by all warring parties. 
""Before the war Yemen was a poor country with a malnutrition problem, but it was one which had a functioning economy, a government that provided services to quite a lot of its people, a national infrastructure and an export base,"" Lowcock told reporters. ""The war has largely destroyed all of that.""
""In the modern world famines are basically about people having no income and then other people blocking efforts to help them. That's basically what we've got in Yemen,"" he added.
HUNGER VS PANDEMIC 
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 after the Iran-allied Houthi group ousted the country's government from Sanaa. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system. The people's suffering has been worsened by an economic and currency collapse, and by the COVID-19 pandemic.
U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks, and new U.S. President Joe Biden has said Yemen is a priority, declaring a halt to U.S. support for the Saudi-led military campaign and demanding the war ""has to end.""
Twelve aid groups, including Oxfam, Save the Children and Care International, have warned that 2.3 million children under the age of five in Yemen will go hungry this year if governments do not step up their funding on Monday.
Muhsin Siddiquey, Oxfam's country director in Yemen, recounted a conversation with an 18-year-old woman, displaced by the conflict and living in a camp in northern Yemen. 
""She said that the coronavirus pandemic gives us two cruel choices: either we stay home and we die from hunger, or we go out and then die from the disease,"" Siddiquey told Reuters. 
Official figures vastly underestimate the spread of COVID-19 in Yemen, according to the United Nations and aid agencies.
In 2018 and 2019, the United Nations prevented famine due to a well-funded aid appeal, which included large donations from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. 
In 2020 the United Nations only received just over half the $3.4 billion it needed, which Lowcock said was largely due to smaller contributions from Gulf countries. He urged them to pledge generously for 2021 and pay quickly.

The United Arab Emirates said on Friday it would pledge $230 million for 2021.

PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - An aircraft belonging to former Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli was detained at Guatemala's international airport by the local anti-narcotics prosecutor's office at the request of U.S. authorities, Guatemalan authorities said late on Friday.
The reasons for the United States requesting the operation were not immediately clear.
Guatemalan authorities said in a statement that the operation was carried out by the Prosecutor's Office against Narcoactivity, with the support of a special unit focused on crimes in airports.
Martinelli, who served as president from 2009 to 2014, was extradited from the United States and jailed in Panama on charges that he had used public money to spy on political rivals while in office. He was released in 2019 after being found not guilty. Last year, he was banned from leaving the country while under investigation for money laundering.
The statement did not refer to Martinelli's whereabouts.
The former president said on his Twitter account that the aircraft, with registration N799RM, was acquired in 2005 and it was currently in the process of changing its flag.
He added that the prosecutor's office that carried out the detention was assigned to the operation because it performs functions at the airport, but denied that the operation had to do with its mandate of fighting drug trafficking.

1434,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 11:55PM ET</span>",Explainer: What is love? Beijing desires unconditional loyalty from Hong Kong,"By Greg Torode and Marius Zaharia
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese officials have signalled that Beijing plans sweeping electoral changes for Hong Kong, possibly as soon as next week, when China's parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), opens in Beijing.
WHAT IS BEIJING PLANNING?
Xia Baolong, director of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, has said the electoral system in the global financial hub needs to be changed to allow only ""patriots"" to govern.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said her government would fully co-operate with Beijing in ""improving"" the political system.
Secretary for Mainland and Constitutional Affairs Erick Tsang announced a bill requiring community-level council representatives to take a ""patriotic"" oath and then clarified what the term meant.
""You cannot say that you are patriotic but you do not love the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party or you do not respect it - this does not make sense,"" Tsang added.
""Patriotism is holistic love.""
WHAT IS THE BIG PICTURE?
Love might be the ideal, but what Beijing really wants is obedience, control and utterly predictable elections. 
The plans are Beijing's latest moves to consolidate its authoritarian hold over Hong Kong after the mass pro-democracy protests and violence that rocked the former British colony for much of 2019. 
Last June, Beijing imposed, through the NPC, a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong. Most pro-democracy activists and politicians have found themselves ensnared by it, or arrested for other reasons.
Some elected legislators have been disqualified, with authorities calling their oaths insincere. The opposition then resigned en masse from the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's mini-parliament.
Making district councillors and civil servants swear ""patriotic"" oaths makes them vulnerable to similar treatment.
Hong Kong's district councils are its only fully democratic institution and the pro-democracy camp took almost 90% of their 452 seats in 2019 elections, humiliating the establishment.
That momentum suggested a small chance for democratic politicians to win an unprecedented majority in legislative elections set for September after a year's delay over coronavirus curbs.
WHAT COULD THE CHANGES LOOK LIKE?
Gerrymandering looks certain. And probably much more.
By design, Hong Kong institutions have been dominated by pro-Beijing politicians since the former British colony's return to Chinese rule in 1997, but the Lam government's unpopularity has exposed risks to Beijing's control.
Half of the city's 70 lawmakers are directly elected in ""geographical constituencies,"" with the rest from ""functional"" ones representing industries, unions, and professions and stacked with pro-Beijing figures.
Media said electoral maps could be redrawn to suit the pro-Beijing camp, taking the number of geographical constituencies to 18 from 5, as a way of crimping the democrats' popular vote. 
Then a 'one vote, two seats' system in each constituency would allow entry to the legislature for the second-placed candidate, probably from the pro-Beijing camp, going by polls that show a split of about 60% to 40% between democratic and pro-establishment sides.
A six-seat district councillors' constituency in the legislature - a democratic stronghold - could also be scrapped.
Beijing is also reported to be considering reshaping a panel of 1,200 elite figures that will choose a new leader when Lam's first five-year term ends in March 2022. 
District councillors only have about a tenth of the committee's seats. But the democratic camp's unprecedented win in 2019 now offers a rare theoretical opportunity to be king-makers in close races between pro-Beijing candidates. 
WHY IS COMMUNIST PARTY LOYALTY SO VEXING IN CHINESE-RULED HONG KONG? 
Generations of Chinese families fled to British-ruled Hong Kong after the Communist Party took power in 1949 and up until recently, city-based Chinese officials have kept a low profile.
The Communist Party still has no open or official locally-registered presence, operating instead through surrogates and proxies.
Key to Hong Kong's enduring freedoms, say many of its residents, is a paragraph in its mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, that specifies:
""The socialist system and policies shall not be practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years.""
The Basic Law reflects the ""one country, two systems"" formula that has long ensured Hong Kong's broad freedom of speech, religion and political action, with its own government except for foreign affairs and defence.
While the city does not enjoy full democracy, universal suffrage is enshrined as a goal in the Basic Law. For decades a thriving civil society contributed to fierce debates in the legislature and elsewhere.
IS THERE MORE TO COME?
Very likely so, on several fronts.
Beijing officials have said Hong Kong's independent judges must also be patriots and that judicial reforms were necessary.
The contours and timing of these are uncertain, but diplomats and businesses are watching closely, seeing judicial independence as the bedrock of Hong Kong's international status.

Hong Kong and Beijing officials, who have repeatedly said rights and freedoms remain intact, are adamant that judicial independence will be maintained.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 11:12PM ET</span>",Syria condemns 'cowardly' U.S. air strikes on Iran-backed militias,"By Maha El Dahan and Amina Ismail
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syria said U.S. air strikes against Iranian-backed militias in the east of the country on Friday were a cowardly act and urged President Joe Biden not to follow ""the law of the jungle"".
An Iraqi militia official close to Iran said the strikes killed one fighter and wounded four. U.S. officials said they were limited in scope to show Biden's administration will act firmly while trying to avoid a big regional escalation.
Washington and Tehran are seeking maximum leverage in attempts to save Iran's nuclear deal reached with world powers in 2015 but abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, after which regional tensions soared and fears of full-scale conflict grew.
""Syria condemns in the strongest terms the cowardly U.S. attack on areas in Deir al-Zor near the Syrian-Iraqi border,"" the Syrian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
""It (the Biden administration) is supposed to stick to international legitimacy, not to the law of the jungle as (did) the previous administration."" 
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh condemned the U.S. strikes, calling them ""illegal aggression"" and a violation of human rights and international law.
""You can't act with impunity. Be careful,"" Biden told reporters in Texas when asked what message he was sending Iran with the strikes.
The air strikes, early on Friday local time, targeted militia sites on the Syrian side of the Iraqi-Syrian frontier, where groups backed by Iran control an important crossing for weapons, personnel and goods.
Western officials and some Iraqi officials accuse Iranian-backed groups of involvement in deadly rocket attacks on U.S. sites and personnel in Iraq over the last month.
Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, also criticised the U.S. strikes and called for ""unconditional respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria.""
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the air strikes in Syria were meant to send the message that Biden will act to protect Americans.
Future U.S. actions in the region will be deliberative and will aim to deescalate tensions in Syria, Psaki said. 
ATTACKS ON U.S. FORCES IN IRAQ
The Iraqi militia official close to Iran said the strikes targeted positions of the Kataib Hezbollah (KH) paramilitary group along the border.
KH later confirmed the death of one of its fighters and identified him as Sayyid Rahi Salam Zayid al-Sharifi. 
""The American enemy persists in its criminality and kills the protectors of the nation and the honorable people of the country, not deterred from shedding innocent blood as long as the wages of murder are received from Saudi Arabia and the Emirates,"" a KH statement said. 
Local sources and a medical source in eastern Syria told Reuters that at least 17 people had been killed, but gave no further details. That toll could not be confirmed.
The Pentagon said it had preliminary information about casualties, but did not provide any details. 
In recent attacks, a non-American contractor was killed at a U.S. military base at Erbil International Airport in Kurdish-run northern Iraq on Feb. 15 and, in the days that followed, rockets were fired at a base hosting U.S. forces, and near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
Biden's decision to strike only in Syria and not in Iraq gives Iraq's government breathing room as it investigates the Erbil attack, which also wounded Americans.
Kataib Hezbollah has denied involvement in recent attacks against U.S. interests. Iran denies involvement in attacks on U.S. sites.
Several attacks, including the one at Erbil airport, have been claimed by little-known groups which some Iraqi and Western officials say are a front for established Iranian-backed groups such as Kataib Hezbollah.
LIMITED RESPONSE
U.S. lawmakers from both political parties welcomed the strikes but a number of Democrats questioned the legal justification under which they were carried out and the continuation of military operations in the Middle East.
""I am very concerned that last night's strike by U.S. forces in Syria puts our country on the path of continuing the Forever War instead of ending it,"" said Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. 
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said the U.S. strikes totally destroyed nine facilities and partially destroyed two facilities at a border control point used by a number of Iranian-backed militant groups, including Kataib Hezbollah and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the decision to carry out the strikes was meant to signal that, while the United States wanted to punish the militias, it did not want the situation to spiral into a bigger conflict. 
The Iraqi military issued a statement saying it had not exchanged information with the United States over the targeting of locations in Syria, and that cooperation with the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq was limited to fighting Islamic State.
Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said Iraq was able to help the United States determine who was responsible for the recent attacks in Iraq, but Baghdad did not assist in the targeting process in Syria. 
Iraq's foreign minister will visit Iran on Saturday to discuss the regional situation including ways to avoid tension and escalation, Iraq's foreign ministry said late on Friday. 

It was not clear how, or whether, the U.S. strikes might affect efforts to coax Iran back into negotiations about both sides resuming compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal.

The Times, citing two unnamed law enforcement officials briefed on the inquiry, said investigators have zeroed in on an individual seen in video footage of the riot who attacked several officers with bear spray, including Brian Sicknick, the policeman who died.
Sicknick, 42, was among a vastly outnumbered group of police officers confronted by the mob who stormed the Capitol in a bid to stop Congress from certifying the election of President Joe Biden.
The violence led to the impeachment of Trump by the U.S. House of Representatives on a charge of inciting an insurrection, but he was acquitted by the Senate in a trial held after he left office. 
According to the New York Times, FBI agents began to suspect soon after opening a homicide probe that Sicknick's death was related to his inhalation of a chemical irritant, such as mace or bear spray, which both law enforcement officers and rioters were armed with during the insurrection.
According to one of the officials cited in the Times' report, video evidence shows that Sicknick's suspected assailant discussed attacking officers with bear spray beforehand.
Medical examiners have yet to rule on the cause or manner of Sicknick's death, as the autopsy is pending results of toxicology tests, the Capitol Police said in a statement on Friday. 
Well over 100 officers were injured in the riot and five people died. 
Although investigators have narrowed potential suspects seen in video footage to a single person this week, they have yet to identify that individual by name, the Times reported.
The newspaper said the U.S. Justice Department declined to comment. The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment to Reuters.

More than 200 people have been arrested for their role in the Capitol siege, a number of them associated with militant groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, underscoring rising concern about threats posed by right-wing extremists.

Allies of Navalny, who was jailed this month on parole violations he said were trumped up, have called on his supporters to lay flowers on the Moscow bridge where Nemtsov was gunned down on the night of Feb. 27, 2015, near the Kremlin.
Navalny's allies have declared a moratorium on street protests until spring after several nationwide rallies were broken up by police who detained more than 11,000 people, according to a monitoring group. 
But the opposition urged Muscovites to come to pay their respects to Nemtsov while observing social distancing and wearing medical masks. Moscow authorities turned down a request for them to hold a commemorative march due to the pandemic. 
""This is a memorial event, not a rally or a march,"" opposition politicians said. ""We recommend that you refrain from bringing posters. There is no need to give any reasons for the police to detain (participants)."" 
Nemtsov, who briefly served as deputy prime minister in the late 1990s before joining the opposition, had been working on a report examining Russia's role in the conflict in Ukraine at the time of his killing.
After his murder, opposition activists began guarding a makeshift memorial on the bridge when municipal authorities turned down a request to put up a plaque there in his honour.
City workers have taken down the memorial on several occasions over the years. Police detained eight people last week as they tried to lay flowers at the memorial after it was dismantled by police.

In 2017 a court sentenced five men to between 11 and 20 years in prison for their involvement in Nemtsov's murder, but the late politician's allies said at the time that the people who had ordered his killing remained at large.

""Out of an abundance of caution, the U.S. government will institute public health measures for the very small number of travelers arriving from the DRC and Guinea,"" the CDC said in a statement late on Friday.
""The Biden Administration is committed to working closely with the affected countries to end these outbreaks before they grow into epidemics,"" the CDC said.
Guinea started an Ebola vaccination campaign on Tuesday, the World Health Organization said earlier in the week, as authorities race to contain the first resurgence of the virus there since the world's worst outbreak in 2013-2016.
The resurgence of the virus, which causes severe bleeding and organ failure and is spread through contact with body fluids, has alarmed governments in the region and international health organizations, concerned that a major outbreak could overwhelm health infrastructures already battling a pandemic.

The CDC said on Friday that beginning next week, travelers from DRC and Guinea will be funneled to six U.S. airports. Airlines will collect passenger information for public health follow-up and intervention for all passengers boarding a flight to the U.S. who were in DRC or Guinea within the previous 21 days.

DENVER (Reuters) - An avowed white supremacist was sentenced on Friday to 19-1/2 years in prison after pleading guilty months ago to a federal hate-crimes case stemming from a botched plot to bomb a historic Colorado synagogue in 2019.
Richard Holzer, 28, appeared in a federal courtroom in Denver for a sentencing that capped an undercover FBI investigation of a plan to blow up Temple Emanuel in Pueblo, Colorado, the second-oldest synagogue in the state.
Although the plot was thwarted, U.S. District Judge Raymond Moore said Holzer had sought “to terrorize the Jewish community” of Pueblo, a city of 112,000 residents about 100 miles south of Denver.
“It is one of the most vulgar ... evil crimes that can be committed against an entire group of people,” Moore said while imposing the sentence sought by prosecutors.
Holzer declined to speak at the hearing.
The defendant pleaded guilty in October to one count of trying to obstruct religious services by force, and one count of attempting to destroy a building used in interstate commerce, according to his plea agreement.
Holzer, who lived in Pueblo, was arrested in November 2019 following an undercover sting by federal agents tracking his social media postings, in which he professed a hatred of Jews, according to an FBI arrest warrant affidavit.
Posing as fellow racists, undercover agents reached out to Holzer and later met with him as he broached the idea of blowing up the synagogue, the affidavit said. Ultimately, the agents provided him with inert pipe bombs and sticks of dynamite before arresting him, court documents showed.
The judge rejected arguments by defense lawyers that Holzer has renounced his racist views, noting that since his arrest he has reached out to other white supremacists and continued to invoke Nazi imagery.

“The notion that he’s turned some corner is fantasy,” Moore said.

Two days before the annual Golden Globes awards ceremony, Time's Up posted banners on its Twitter account saying: ""Hollywood Foreign Press Association: Not a Single Black Member Out of 87,"" with the slogan ""A cosmetic fix isn't enough.""
The Golden Globes are chosen by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFP) and have grown to be one of the most popular award shows in the run-up to the annual Oscars.
Prominent Black celebrities Kerry Washington, Sterling K. Brown, Ava DuVernay and TV producer Shonda Rhimes swiftly threw their support behind the campaign, along with the likes of directors J.J. Abrams and Judd Apatow.
""Old news. New energy,"" tweeted DuVernay, the director of civil rights movie ""Selma."" 
The campaign follows an investigation by the Los Angeles Times last week that noted there were currently no Black people among the 87-member group of foreign entertainment journalists who make up the HFPA.
The association said earlier this week that it was committed to diversifying its membership.
""We understand that we need to bring in Black members, as well as members from other underrepresented backgrounds, and we will immediately work to implement an action plan to achieve these goals as soon as possible,” the group said in a statement.
It added that 35% of its members are from non-European countries.
The HFPA also came under fire when the Golden Globe nominations failed to recognize some high-profile content by and about Black people, including movies like ""One Night in Miami"" and ""Da 5 Bloods,"" and the television drama ""I May Destroy You"" in the top categories.
The nominations did include multiple actors and directors of color.
The HFPA did not immediately return a request for comment on the Time's Up campaign.

Time's Up was created in 2018 as a response to allegations of widespread sexual harassment in Hollywood and has since broadened its mission to fight inequality and injustice in the workplace.

(Reuters) - A leader of the far-right Oath Keepers group accused of helping lead the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol by Donald Trump's supporters lost her bid to be released from jail, despite disavowing the group during a Friday court hearing.
U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington denied Jessica Watkins's request to be released while the criminal case against her unfolds.
Mehta said Watkins was a danger to her Ohio community, despite her saying during brief remarks to the court that she was now ""appalled"" by the Oath Keepers and renouncing her membership.
""It was an historic event; an incursion on the Capitol; a real threat on the fabric of our democracy,"" the judge said of the Jan. 6 attack. ""She was not just willing participant in that; she was an organizer and a leader in those efforts.""
Watkins had asked Mehta to release her to home confinement in Ohio while she awaits trial, citing in part the risk of maltreatment she faces in jail as a transgender woman.
Watkins, an Afghanistan war veteran who has pleaded not guilty, is among nine associates of the anti-government organization charged with conspiring to storm the Capitol to prevent Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's electoral victory.
Federal prosecutors have accused Watkins, 38, of illegally entering the Capitol building. Her attorney has said she did not engage in any violence.
Prosecutors have said the Oath Keepers began planning a military-style assault as early as November. More than 300 people have been charged so far in connection with the attack, which left five people dead, including a police officer.
A federal prosecutor said during the court hearing that the Oath Keepers made ""substantial efforts"" to set up a heavily armed strike force outside Washington that day.

""There were substantial efforts to make that a reality — to have guns and weapons available, at the ready, for people like Jessica Watkins,"" prosecutor Ahmed Baset said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday urged Central Americans without travel papers not undertake risky journeys to the United States, as the Biden administration grapples with fast-rising irregular immigration across the southern border.
Speaking at an online meeting with officials in El Paso and Mexico's Ciudad Juarez at the start of a ""virtual visit"" that included conversations with Mexican ministers, Blinken said the United States was strictly enforcing border laws. 
""The border is closed to irregular migration,"" Blinken said. 
In recent weeks, numbers of apprehensions at the border have jumped sharply, as Central Americans flee the worst humanitarian crisis in a generation triggered by devastating hurricanes and the coronavirus pandemic. The number of people going hungry in Central America has nearly quadrupled in the last two years.
President Joe Biden's administration has been undoing Trump-era immigration policies that closed off routes to asylum in the United States, while trying to dissuade new arrivals until the system for legal migration is overhauled. 
""President Biden is committed to reforming our immigration system and ensuring safe, orderly and humane processing at our border. Those things will take time,"" Blinken said.
The two sides also discussed security, with Blinken agreeing about the importance of combating weapons trafficking from the United States, Mexico said in a statement. 
ENERGY CONCERNS
The online meetings also touched on trade, climate change, and ""energy concerns,"" the State Department said, in a sign of Biden's broader agenda with Mexico after his predecessor's singular focus on migration.
Before the meetings, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told the United States not to meddle in domestic energy policy, reflecting a view that the new U.S. government will be more proactive in defending investor interests as Mexico moves to change rules in favor of state power and oil companies. 
""We do not meddle in the affairs of the United States or any other nation,"" Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference. ""Because we don't want anybody deciding about Mexican matters.""
Lopez Obrador, an energy nationalist who has sought to renegotiate electricity and pipeline contracts with U.S. and Canadian companies, faced little pressure from former President Donald Trump over his policies.
Mexico relies heavily on fuel imported from the United States. A new bill in Congress that aims to reshape Mexico's electricity industry to favor state utility CFE has caused alarm among lobbies for private investment.
Business groups have pushed for Lopez Obrador's energy shake-up to be a more prominent part of the bilateral conversation, one senior industry official said.
Lopez Obrador appeared to suggest that the United States had already raised the issue with his government.
""They say we should act in a certain way, that's fine, freedom of expression must be guaranteed,"" he said.
In seeking to use more domestic fuel, Lopez Obrador has also limited the growth of foreign renewable energy operators, which critics say affects Mexico's obligations on climate emissions, a policy priority for Biden.
In the meeting with Blinken, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Mexico was looking for ways to meet its obligations in reducing greenhouse emissions, a government statement said. 
Economy Minister Tatiana Clouthier said during her talks with Blinken that Lopez Obrador saw the new USMCA North American trade deal as a tool for the post-coronavirus recovery and was willing to work with Biden on making supply chains more resilient to shocks like the pandemic. 

In the afternoon, Blinken turned to Canada, holding meetings with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Foreign Minister Marc Garneau.

DUBAI (Reuters) - ""No smoking gun,"" pro-government Saudi commentators concluded in response to a U.S. intelligence assessment that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had approved the operation to capture or kill journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 
A few minutes after the report was released, many Saudis flooded Twitter with the hashtag saying, ""We are all Mohammed bin Salman.""
Rights groups called for tough action.
Saudi Arabia, one of Washington's closest Arab allies, officially dismissed what it called the ""negative, false and unacceptable assessment in the report pertaining to the kingdom's leadership"", according to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The ministry added that those responsible for the ""heinous crime"" had been tried in Saudi courts and that ""justice was served."" 
Riyadh has denied any involvement by the crown prince, also known as MbS.
Commentators close to the government took to social media to defend the crown prince, King Salman's son and de facto ruler of the kingdom. 
Ali Shihabi, former head of the Arabia Foundation in Washington which regularly supports Saudi policy, said there was nothing in the report that had not been said before and ""absolutely no smoking gun."" 
""Extraordinary that all this hype is made about this document... This thin 'report' is actually evidence that no hard proof exists against MBS,"" Shihabi said on Twitter. 
Abdulrahman al-Rashed, a Saudi columnist who runs a government-controlled media group said ""... and it is stated in the report: It is not certain that the accused team was on a journey to get rid of Khashoggi.""
He too said there was ""no smoking gun.""
Saudi Arabia's biggest newspapers and television channels did not cover the release of the report, instead showing sports events and other unrelated programming. In its evening bulletin, Saudi-owned Al Arabiya referred to it briefly, focusing on what it said was the absence of concrete evidence. 
""The nation is fortified,"" wrote the conservative and semi-official Okaz newspaper on the front page of its weekend edition, with a large picture of the crown prince smiling. 
""The Biden administration will soon realize that the complex issues of the region will not find a solution, except through a new and exceptional agreement with its partners in the region that includes holding Tehran accountable,"" Okaz said.
Activists and rights groups, however, clamored for justice and sanctions against Saudi Arabia and MbS on social media.
""Thank you, Joe Biden for transparency about Jamal Khashoggi's murder. Now we need sanctions on the Saudi prince responsible,"" Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), a U.S.-based human rights group founded by Khashoggi, said in a statement.
An ""MbS-Khashoggi-killer"" hashtag started trending after the release of the report.

Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi's fiancee, tweeted: ""#justiceforjamal.""

Among the fatalities, most died from bullet wounds, a hospital source said, adding that about 120 protesters were wounded. At least 57 members of the security forces were injured, according to a another hospital source and a security source. 
The clashes continued on Friday evening after a week of violence that erupted on Sunday when security forces fired to disperse protesters, who were trying to storm the provincial government building using rocks and Molotov cocktails.
Protesters are demanding the removal of the governor and justice for protesters who killed since 2019.
Late on Friday Amnesty International said it ""verified videos from Nassirya that contain clear audio of gunfire and show police firing weapons as well as dead protesters in the streets.""
Ali Bayati, a member of Iraq’s semi-official High Commission for Human Rights, said on twitter that five have been killed and 271 injured including 147 members of the security forces in the last five days.
""The situation is out of control in Nassiriya and the blood is shedding while the government is watching,"" Bayati posted on twitter.
Iraq’s biggest anti-government protests in decades broke out in October 2019 and continued for months, with hundreds of thousands of Iraqis demanding jobs, services and removal of the ruling elite, whom they accused of corruption. 
Nearly 500 people were killed, and the protests caused the resignation of Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi.
Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who took office in May 2020, has pledged justice for activists killed or abused by armed groups. But no prosecutions have occurred so far. 
The clashes come just a week before Pope Francis visits Iraq from March 5 to 8. He is due to tour the ancient Mesopotamian site of Ur, only a few kilometres (mile) away from the clashes.

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 03:05PM ET</span>",Murder in the consulate: Pressure grows on Saudi crown prince,"(Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's crown prince, accused in a U.S. intelligence report of approving an operation to capture or kill a prominent journalist, crushed dissent and sidelined rivals in a push for power that has delighted admirers, unsettled Riyadh's traditional foreign allies and shocked human rights advocates. 
A declassified U.S. intelligence assessment released on Friday said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the operation against Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a royal insider-turned-critic who was killed at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate in 2018 and his body dismembered. 
The disclosure poses a fresh challenge to the 35-year-old prince's reputation as the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden places Saudi Arabia's human rights record under close scrutiny.
While Riyadh eventually admitted that Khashoggi was killed in a ""rogue"" extradition operation gone wrong, it has denied any involvement by the crown prince, often known in the West by his initials MbS. The prince has said, however, that he accepted ultimate responsibility as de facto ruler.
The murder undercut MbS's promotion of himself as a bold reformer pursuing new freedoms in the conservative kingdom and deterred some investors from the country -- the world's largest oil exporter -- in the months after the killing.
Far-reaching reforms, including the listing of state oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent and activism and a secretive purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, which unnerved some Western allies and potential business partners.
At the same time, the crown prince promoted a more sharply assertive foreign policy in the region, pledging a tougher stance against the regional influence of sworn foe Iran and taking the kingdom, home to Islam's holiest sites, into a costly and unpopular war in Yemen.
The approach was criticised by some Western diplomats and commentators, who said Riyadh appeared at times a mercurial and unpredictable force in foreign affairs, in contrast to the considered and slow moving tempo of traditional Saudi diplomacy.
That included freezing out German firms and new trade with Canada in 2017 over public remarks seen as critical of Saudi foreign policy and its detention of women's rights activists.
MbS enjoyed strong ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump that largely shielded him from Western criticism. After Biden pledged to take a harder line on Saudi Arabia, the prince made overtures seen by diplomats as showing he was a valuable partner for regional stability.
The moves included a deal to end a bitter row with Qatar that saw Saudi Arabia and its allies boycott Doha in 2017.
RESENTMENT WITHIN FAMILY
MbS rose from near obscurity after his father ascended the throne in 2015, quickly building a global reputation as a bold reformer intent on diversifying the oil-dominated economy and modernising a kingdom long set in its ways.
He marginalized senior members of the royal family after ousting an older cousin as crown prince in a 2017 palace coup, and consolidated control over Saudi security and intelligence agencies, stirring resentment within some branches of the family, sources with royal connections have said. 
Later that year, he arrested several royals and other prominent Saudis, holding them for months at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel in an anti-corruption campaign that caused shockwaves at home and abroad.
On the economy, MbS announced sweeping changes labelled Vision 2030 aimed at developing new industries to create jobs for Saudis, tackling corruption and introducing fiscal reforms.
High-profile social reforms included allowing cinemas and public entertainment and ending a ban on women driving.
While he is popular among young Saudis and has supporters among many royals, some ruling family members resent Mohammed's grip on power and questioned his leadership after unprecedented attacks on Saudi oil plants in 2019, five sources with ties to the royals and business elite said in late 2019.
In March 2020, authorities detained former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef and the king's brother Prince Ahmed in a move sources with royal connections said was aimed at ensuring a smooth succession.
RAPID CHANGE
    MbS has embraced the media, unlike usually secretive Saudi rulers. He featured prominently during a tour in 2018 to persuade British and U.S. allies that ""shock"" reforms made the kingdom a better place to invest.
The cornerstone of the economic transformation was selling shares in Aramco. A listing on the domestic bourse went ahead in 2019 after several false starts, briefly hitting a towering $2 trillion valuation coveted by the crown prince, but there was not enough investor appetite for a foreign offering.
    On foreign policy, the prince was regarded by diplomats as a prime mover behind the Yemen war, which the kingdom entered weeks after he became defence minister in 2015, and a brief kidnapping of then-Lebanese prime minister Saad al-Hariri in Saudi Arabia in 2017.
The harder stance on Iran followed what some hawkish Saudi officials regard as years of growing Iranian influence across the Middle East, amid concerns that Washington, under former President Barack Obama, turned a blind eye to what Riyadh sees as a pernicious expansion of Iranian activity in Arab nations.
In a move that shifted the region's power balance, Riyadh gave tacit approval to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain forging ties with Israel in 2020. Afterwards, MbS covertly met Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu in the kingdom, although Saudi officials denied the historic visit.

MbS has shown Saudi Arabia will brook no interference in its domestic affairs. Saudi courts in early 2021 convicted a prominent rights activist and a Saudi-U.S. physician, while suspending most of their jail terms, in a nod to the Biden administration's scrutiny of the kingdom's human rights.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza said on Friday he was stepping down as leader of the nation's largest school district, leaving at a time when city officials are scrambling to bring students back to classrooms safely. 
Carranza, who was tapped by Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2018 to run the district of nearly 1.1 million school children, said he would depart on March 15 to take ""time to grieve"" after losing several family members and friends to COVID-19. 
De Blasio named Meisha Porter as Carranza's successor. Currently serving as executive superintendent in the city's Bronx borough, Porter will become the district's first Black female chancellor.
""This school system deserves a chancellor who 100% is taking up the helm and leading the charge to bringing everybody back in September,"" Carranza said at a news briefing on Friday.
New York City schools have oscillated between a hybrid learning model and all-remote learning since the fall.
The mayor shut down school buildings in mid-November due to an increasing COVID-19 infection rate and has gradually brought students back to classrooms, starting with the youngest students. Earlier this week, middle school students returned to school buildings, while all instruction for high school students remains virtual. 
""The first thing I'm looking forward to is reopening high school, and focusing in on how we reopen schools fully in September,"" Porter told reporters on Friday. 
Carranza is the second high-profile member of de Blasio's administration to depart in the midst of the health crisis in recent months, following the resignation of New York City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot in August.
Carranza's departure coincides with his mounting disagreement with de Blasio over how to eliminate entrenched segregation in the city's schools, the New York Times reported.
Carranza has voiced support for eliminating standardized tests for pre-school children's admission into gifted programs that historically have tended to favor admission for white and Asian students. 
The city's school district is predominantly non-white, with Hispanic students making up 41%, followed by Blacks at 26%, Asians at 16% and whites at 15%. White and Asian-American students comprise about 75% of the city’s gifted offerings, according to the Times. 

De Blasio said on Friday that the city would announce plans to revamp admissions for its gifted student program admission for September under Chancellor Porter.

1450,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 12:55PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Biden team considering a halt to 'offensive' arms sales for Saudis,"By Patricia Zengerle and Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration is considering the cancellation of arms deals with Saudi Arabia that pose human rights concerns while limiting future military sales to ""defensive"" weapons, as it reassesses it relationship with the kingdom. 
Four sources familiar with the administration's thinking said that after pausing half a billion dollars in arms deals with Saudi Arabia out of concern over casualties in Yemen earlier this year, officials are assessing the equipment and training included in recent sales to determine what can be considered defensive. Those deals would be allowed.
A State Department spokesperson said, ""Our focus is on ending the conflict in Yemen even as we ensure Saudi Arabia has everything it needs to defend its territory and its people,"" adding Biden has pledged to end U.S. military support for the military campaign against the Houthis. 
The Biden administration is recalibrating its relationship with Saudi Arabia, a country with which it has severe human rights concerns but which is also one of Washington's closest U.S. allies in countering the threat posed by Iran. 
""They're trying to figure out where do you draw the lines between offensive weapons and defensive stuff,"" said one congressional aide familiar with the issue, describing the process. The Biden administration is expected as soon as Friday to release a sensitive U.S. intelligence report on the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who wrote for The Washington Post. 
The report finds that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country's de factor ruler, approved the killing,
U.S. officials said.
Sales of products deemed defensive - like Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missile defense systems made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) or Patriot missile defense systems made by Lockheed and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) - would still be allowed under such the new policy. But it would end big-ticket deals -- for products such as precision-guided munitions (PGM) and small-diameter bombs -- like those brokered under former President Donald Trump in the face of strong objections from members of Congress. After he lost the Nov. 3 presidential election, Trump's State Department kept approving weapons sales that could be considered offensive. 
It cleared the sale of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co GBU-39 small diameter bombs worth some $290 million to Saudi Arabia. The Trump administration also gave its blessing to the sale to Riyadh of 7500 Raytheon PGMs for nearly $480 million. 
EMIRATES AFFECTED 
The weapons review also affects $23 billion of deals with the United Arab Emirates, another country that has been an important U.S. partner.
On Jan. 20, the day that Trump left office and Biden became president, the UAE signed agreements with the outgoing administration to buy up to 50 F-35 jets, 18 armed drones and other defense equipment in a deal worth $23 billion.
That sale, which the Trump administration justified as allowing the UAE to deter Iranian ""threats,"" is also among those being reviewed by the Biden administration.
Congress had voted to block the UAE deal out of concern that it was being rushed through without sufficient assurances that the equipment would not fall into the wrong hands, but the Republican-controlled Senate did not override his veto.
U.S. lawmakers said they would be more comfortable with limits on offensive weapons, with many vehemently opposed to the continued massive sales of munitions that they said have contributed to the humanitarian disaster in Yemen.
""We should continue to sell military equipment to our partners in the Gulf, but we should make sure that these really are truly defensive arms,"" Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations this week.
Murphy, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Middle East subcommittee, said sales of items like armed Reaper drones to the UAE could fuel a regional arms race.

While Trump saw weapons sales as a way to create American jobs, Biden appears to revert to a stance that weighs human rights abuses more seriously than under the Trump presidency, a defense industry executive said.

The eastern states of Assam and West Bengal and the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala will hold state assembly polls between late March and April, India's Election Commission said in a statement on Friday. 
Modi is battling his biggest political challenge in years as tens of thousands of farmers have camped out on the outskirts of New Delhi since late last year, blocking highways and demanding the government repeal the laws they say will harm farmers and benefit large corporate buyers. 
But the federal government has refused their demands, saying the laws were crucial to bring new investments into the sector.
The protests have also caught international attention with celebrities such as pop star Rihanna and environmentalist Greta Thunberg announcing their support for the farmers.
Bengal, where Modi's right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is up against firebrand leader Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress party, will conduct elections in eight phases starting March 27.

While Assam will complete elections in three phases also beginning March 27, Kerala and Tamil Nadu will hold a one-day poll on April 6. Results will be counted on May 2 in all the states.

CHISINAU (Reuters) - Moldova's medical agency on Friday said it had approved Russia's Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19, despite President Maia Sandu saying it could not be registered until the World Health Organisation had done so. 
Sandu denied statements by her predecessor Igor Dodon and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which markets the vaccine abroad, that Moldova had become the 38th country, including Russia, to register the shot.
""Moldova will only use a vaccine that has undergone WHO registration procedure,"" Sandu told reporters. 
Pro-Moscow Dodon has been a thorn in Sandu's side since she triumphed in a November election. Sandu, who favours closer relations with the European Union, has accused parliament, which is dominated by lawmakers aligned with Dodon, of trying to sabotage her presidency and curb her power.
But Moldova's Medicines and Medical Devices Agency on Friday said it had authorised two vaccines registered for emergency use by the WHO - Pfizer/BioNTech, and a shot developed by Anglo-Swedish firm AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) - as well as Sputnik V. 
""Deliveries of the vaccine to Moldova will start very soon,"" Dodon wrote on his Telegram channel. ""I would like to mention that the successful registration of the vaccine in our country took place despite the efforts of the Moldovan president's office to block it.""
RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev also said the vaccine had been registered, but the Moldovan presidency was doubling down.

SRINAGAR, India/MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan (Reuters) - Villagers living on both sides of the Line of Control dividing the Himalayan region of Kashmir welcomed an agreement between long-time foes India and Pakistan to stop shelling from each side, but some were sceptical it would hold.
The nuclear-armed neighbours signed a ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control (LoC) in 2003, but that has frayed in recent years and there have been mounting casualties.
In a joint statement on Thursday, India and Pakistan said they would observe a ceasefire.
""It has given a new lease of life to us. We were living in constant fear of being hit,"" said Laldin Khatana, the headman of Churnada village on the Indian side of the border.
Khatana said that two people had been killed last year by shelling in the hillside village, home to 1,600 people, many of whom gathered at a mausoleum to celebrate the new agreement.
""It was affecting our farming and grazing,"" he told Reuters via telephone. ""And children were scared to go to school.""
Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan, which claim the region in full but rule only in part. Tensions reignited after New Delhi withdrew the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir state in August 2019 and split it into two federally administered territories.
Since 2018, Indian data shows that 70 civilians and 72 soldiers have been killed in cross-border firing. 
On the Pakistani side, nearly 300 civilians have been killed since 2014, when ceasefire violations began rising, according to a Pakistan military source.
""The fresh announcement is welcome and can help us live a life free of fear, only if implemented in letter and in spirit,"" said Danish Shaikh, a resident of Ban Chattar village in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir's Neelum valley.
""Who knows how seriously and how long they will stick to the fresh understanding?""
The picturesque Neelum valley saw hundreds of hotels and guesthouses sprout up when the ceasefire held, with tourists visiting year round. 
But with skirmishes and firing increasing, tourism went into a tailspin and guesthouse operators like Khawaja Owais were forced to dig into their savings.
""This is good news indeed. Not just for us who are running businesses in the valley but for everyone who has faced death and destruction during heavy shelling,"" Owais said of the agreement. 

""Let's hope and pray it remains intact.""

Hundreds of demonstrators rallied in the capital Yerevan to demand his downfall, and a leading opposition figure called on the army to rebel against him. Two former presidents have already said he must step down. 
Pashinyan, 45, accused the military of a coup attempt on Thursday and tried to sack the chief of staff, after the army issued a written statement calling for him to resign.
He has faced calls to quit since November from countrymen who blame him for a disastrous six-week war that saw ethnic Armenian forces lose swathes of territory in neighbouring Azerbaijan they had held for decades.
While crowds on Friday demanded he resign, thousands of others had gathered in the capital to rally behind him on Thursday.
Pashinyan told his supporters on Thursday he was firing Onik Gasparyan, the chief of the army's general staff. But by Friday the dismissal had not yet been approved by Armenia's president, a step needed for it to enter force. 
President Armen Sarkissian held a meeting with Gasparyan, the president's office said, without releasing further details. 
Vazgen Manukyan, a politician who has been touted by the opposition as a possible interim prime minister to replace Pashinyan, told hundreds of supporters at a rally that the army would never allow Gasparyan to be sacked. 
""You think the army will easily agree that Pashinyan illegally removes their head? No. The army will rebel. I call on the army to rebel. The army shouldn't carry out illegal orders,"" Manukyan said. 
The General Prosecutor's Office told Reuters on Friday that it was investigating whether the army's call for the prime minister to go constituted a crime. 
""The general staff's statement and the possible risk of developments around it are the subject of our attention,"" Gor Abrahamyan, an aide to the prosecutor general, told Reuters by telephone. ""If any elements of a crime outlined in the criminal code are revealed, a legal response will immediately follow.""
Pashinyan, a former journalist and lawmaker, came to power in a peaceful popular uprising in May 2018 known as Armenia's velvet revolution. 
But the loss of territory in and around the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh last year was a bitter blow for Armenians, who had won control of the area in the 1990s in a war which killed at least 30,000 people.

The conflict was brought to a halt by a ceasefire deal brokered by Russia. Moscow, which has deployed peacekeepers to enforce the ceasefire, said on Friday it was vital the agreements be fully implemented despite Armenia's crisis.

KANO, Nigeria (Reuters) - Unidentified gunmen seized more than 300 girls in a nighttime raid on a school in northwest Nigeria on Friday and are believed to be holding some of them in a forest, police said.
It was the second such kidnapping in little over a week in a region increasingly targeted by militants and criminal gangs. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
Police in Zamfara state said they had begun search-and-rescue operations with the army to find the ""armed bandits"" who took the 317 girls from the Government Girls Science Secondary School in the town of Jangebe.
""There's information that they were moved to a neighbouring forest, and we are tracing and exercising caution and care,"" Zamfara police commissioner Abutu Yaro told a news conference.
He did not say whether those possibly moved to the forest included all of them.
Zamfara's information commissioner, Sulaiman Tanau Anka, told Reuters the assailants stormed in firing sporadically during the 1 a.m. raid.
""Information available to me said they came with vehicles and moved the students, they also moved some on foot,"" he said.
School kidnappings were first carried out by jihadist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province but the tactic has now been adopted by other militants in the northwest whose agenda is unclear. 
They have become endemic around the increasingly lawless north, to the anguish of families and frustration of Nigeria's government and armed forces. Friday's was the third such incident since December.
The rise in abductions is fuelled in part by sizeable government payoffs in exchange for child hostages, catalysing a broader breakdown of security in the north, officials have said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The government denies making such payouts.
RAGE AND FRUSTRATION
Jangebe town seethed with anger over the abduction, said a government official who was part of the delegation to the community.
Young men hurled rocks at journalists driving through the town, injuring a cameraman, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""The situation at Jangebe community is tense as people mobilised to block security operatives, journalists and government officials from getting access to the main town,"" he said.
Parents also had no faith in authorities to return their kidnapped girls, said Mohammed Usman Jangebe, the father of one abductee, by phone.
""We are going to rescue our children, since the government isn't ready to give them protection,"" he said.
""All of us that have had our children abducted have agreed to follow them into to the forest. We will not listen to anyone now until we rescue our children,"" Jangebe said, before ending the call.
MILITARY SHAKEUP
President Muhammadu Buhari replaced his long-standing military chiefs earlier this month amid the worsening violence. 
Last week, unidentified gunmen kidnapped 42 people including 27 students, and killed one pupil, in an overnight attack on a boarding school in the north-central state of Niger. 
The hostages are yet to be released.
In December, dozens of gunmen abducted 344 schoolboys from the town of Kankara in northwest Katsina state. They were freed after six days but the government denied a ransom had been paid.
Islamic State's West Africa branch in 2018 kidnapped more than 100 schoolgirls from the town of Dapchi in northeast Nigeria, all but one of whom - the only Christian - were released. 
A ransom was paid, according to the United Nations.
Perhaps the most notorious kidnapping in recent years was when Boko Haram militants abducted 276 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok in Borno state in April 2014. The incident drew widespread global attention. 
Many have been found or rescued by the army, or freed in negotiations between the government and Boko Haram, also for a hefty ransom, according to sources. 

But 100 are still missing, either remaining with Boko Haram or dead, security officials say.

At least one person was wounded in the protests in the main city of Yangon, a witness said, and several people were hurt in the second city of Mandalay.
Police were not immediately available for comment.
The Southeast Asian country has been in crisis since the army seized power on Feb. 1 and detained government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and much of her party leadership after the military complained of fraud in a November election her party won. The election commission said the vote was fair.
Suu Kyi had been moved this week from house arrest in the capital Naypyitaw to an undisclosed location, the Myanmar Now website said, quoting officials of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party.
A lawyer for Suu Kyi said he had been told the same by NLD officials. He earlier complained that he had been given no access ahead of a court appearance set for March 1.
There have been daily protests and strikes by democracy supporters for about three weeks, often drawing hundreds of thousands of people across the ethnically diverse country.
In Yangon, hundreds of people congregated again in several groups, chanting slogans. Riot police rushed at them, firing stun grenades and guns into the air to send people scattering.
""One house let me in to hide,"" a journalist told Reuters from the scene. ""I can't leave yet as the police are very near and firing into the air.""
Several people were detained, witnesses said, among them a Japanese journalist who was held briefly.
Domestic media and witnesses reported a similar confrontation in Mandalay where police also fired rubber bullets. An emergency service worker said children were hurt there and media published pictures of two with minor injuries as well as of one man with a bloody leg wound. It was not clear how they were hurt.
Police also broke up protests in the capital, Naypyitaw, the central town of Magwe and in the western hill town of Hakha, according to witnesses and social media posts.
'LOSS OF RIGHTS'
Security forces have been more restrained than they were during earlier bouts of protest in the course of nearly half a century of military rule.
Military chief General Min Aung Hlaing says authorities were using minimal force. Nevertheless, at least three protesters have died. The army says a policeman was also killed.
Suu Kyi, 75, has been detained incommunicado in Naypyitaw since the coup.
The Myanmar Now website said she had been moved from her home in the capital, quoting a senior NLD source as saying: ""We don’t know where she’s being kept anymore."" 
A lawyer for her, Khin Maung Zaw, told Reuters he had heard the same from NLD officials but could not confirm it. Authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Khin Maung Zaw earlier complained he was not able to prepare properly for her next hearing, on Monday, because he had no access.
""I need instructions from her on how to conduct our defence at the court ... I'm concerned that there will be a loss of rights to access to justice and access to legal counsel,"" he said.
Suu Kyi, the daughter of Myanmar's independence hero, spent nearly 15 years under house arrest under previous juntas. She faces charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios and of violating a natural disaster law by breaching coronavirus protocols.
Protesters say her party's election victory must be respected.
But the military replaced the election commission's top officials and its new chairman, citing fraud and voter-list errors, said on Friday the polls had been annulled, the Irrawaddy online media outlet reported.
The NLD said in a statement the ruling was an insult to voters and the military did not have the authority to appoint a new election commission.

The army has promised a new election but has not set a date. A vote is not expected until after a one-year state of emergency the military imposed when it seized power.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast received a shipment of COVID-19 doses from the COVAX vaccine-sharing facility on Friday, becoming the second country to benefit from a programme meant to ensure fairer distribution amid a global scramble. 
A plane carrying 504,000 doses touched down in the commercial capital Abidjan, paving the way for the West African nation to launch a vaccination campaign next week. 
By the end of this year, COVAX plans to deliver nearly 2 billion doses to over 90 low- and middle-income countries, hoping to level a playing field that has seen wealthier nations vaccinate millions while comparatively few have received shots in poorer parts of the world.
""This fight against the pandemic must be done in a democratic manner,"" said Ivorian Health Minister Eugene Aka Aouele as he welcomed the arrival of the shipment.
""The democratisation of the fight enables our countries to get the right to the vaccines in the same way as the big nations,"" he said. 
The first batch from COVAX was delivered to neighbouring Ghana on Wednesday.
CHALLENGES
The plan should provide coverage for up to 20% of countries' populations. But it will not be enough to reach herd immunity and effectively contain the virus, forcing African countries to also look to bilateral agreements, donations and an African Union procurement plan. 
And while many countries will receive the COVAX shots for free, they have to find financing for distribution and community outreach.
""You want to make sure that the right regulatory approval, the right cold storage is there and everything else, otherwise you risk having things not work,"" said Seth Berkley, chief executive of the GAVI vaccines alliance, which leads COVAX with the World Health Organization and other partners. 
Africa's reported COVID-19 death toll surpassed 100,000 last week, much less than other continents but rising fast as a second wave of infections overwhelms under-equipped hospitals.
Ivory Coast, population 25 million, has recorded around 35,650 coronavirus cases and 188 deaths.
In Abidjan, some residents were sceptical about the vaccination drive. 

""It's the rich and their families who will get vaccinated,"" said 40-year-old vegetable-seller Seydou Kamagate, as customers at his stall nodded in agreement. ""I don't think my family and I will ever get a vaccine.""

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 10:20AM ET</span>",Czech parliament backs new pandemic powers as government seeks tighter lockdown,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech lower house on Friday approved a bill giving the Health Ministry new powers without needing a state of emergency order, as the government laid out plans to ""radically"" tighten lockdown measures amid a renewed spread of COVID-19 infections.
The country of 10.7 million has had among the world's highest per capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths in recent weeks, with new variants complicating the situation. 
The so-called pandemic bill was supported by almost all parties in parliament and gives the Health Ministry the right to issue bans and orders, like closing shops or services, with the cabinet's consent. 
Under previous laws, the government had that right only under a state of emergency, which needs lawmakers' consent to run beyond 30 days. Restaurant closures, which have been widely used during the pandemic, can fall under public health laws.
The approval of the legislation, pushed by opposition parties, is only one step in the government's efforts to tighten restrictions after Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Wednesday ""hellish days"" were ahead and hospitals faced unprecedented stress.
The government will still need a state of emergency as it seeks to sharply limit people's movements and contacts in the coming weeks, measures not covered in the new legislation.
Babis's minority government was asking for an extension of an existing state of emergency into March in parliament on Friday.
Lawmakers rejected an earlier request but some opposition parties said on Friday the government should simply call a new sate of emergency given new virus variants have changed the situation. 

The government is set to unveil details of new restrictions once state of emergency frameworks are agreed.

Weekly street protests from February 2019 prompted the army to force a veteran president from power in the biggest shock to Algeria's political system in decades, stopping only for a COVID-19 lockdown in March last year.
The protesters are demanding a complete overhaul of the old ruling elite, an end to corruption and the army's withdrawal from politics. 
Marchers chanted ""peaceful, peaceful"" and ""our demands are legitimate"" on Friday as they walked through the city centre amid a large police presence. 
""We are still able to achieve all our goals,"" said Farida Rechichi, a 25-year old student at the Algiers law faculty. 
While thousands of people took part in Friday's march, however, the numbers were smaller than those involved in the protests before the lockdown last year, when tens of thousands regularly took part. 

A first protest after the lockdown took place last week in the eastern town of Kherrata. The first protest to take place again in Algiers was on Monday.

1461,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 09:50AM ET</span>","In independence threat, Scotland's ex-first minister attacks government","By Elizabeth Piper and Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Scotland's former first minister Alex Salmond accused the nation's government on Friday of acting illegally and lacking leadership in a bitter row with his successor that threatens to damage the Scottish independence movement.
The feud between Salmond and his successor Nicola Sturgeon, has reached fever pitch in recent weeks, pitting the former friends against each other in a sparring match that could eventually put pressure on her to resign.
Sturgeon has denied his accusations.
First Minister Sturgeon and her bid for a second independence referendum have been riding high in opinion polls, with many praising her handling of Scotland's response to the coronavirus pandemic. Support has fallen back, although a majority still back a second referendum.
Salmond, who was cleared of committing multiple sex offences against women last year, said the handling of his case by the Scottish government had shown a failure of leadership, accusing politicians of being too close to the judiciary.
""The government acted illegally, but somehow nobody's to blame,"" Salmond told an inquiry into the government's handling of the case.
""Collectively these events shine a light on a government whose actions are no longer true to the principles of openness, accountability and transparency, which are the core principles on which this Scottish parliament was founded.""
He added: ""Some consequences should follow from unlawful conduct.""
Salmond was once Sturgeon's mentor and the two of them formed a powerful partnership that made the Scottish National Party a dominant force in Scotland and took them close to winning an independence referendum in 2014, when Scots voted 55%-45% to remain in the United Kingdom.
But the allegations of sexual harassment against Salmond in 2018, which he has denied, drove a wedge between them, and resulted in the SNP becoming fractured, which could dent the party's predicted victory in a local election in May.
The row stems from Sturgeon's handling of the government's response to the case against Salmond and whether she misled parliament over the details of what and when she knew of the allegations against her predecessor.
Friday's inquiry is looking at the government and its handling of the case. Salmond described the government as having been ""found to have ... acted unlawfully, unfairly and tainted by apparent bias"".
On Thursday, Sturgeon told Scotland's parliament that she would answer fully to the inquiry and accused opposition politicians of siding with Salmond and sacrificing their principles on the ""altar of the ego of one man"".
Sturgeon wants a strong showing for her party in May's election to hand her a mandate to hold a second referendum on independence - something British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will not approve. 
Asked about the Salmond case, a spokesman for the British premier told reporters: ""His focus and the focus of politicians through the UK should be on fighting the pandemic, working together to defeat COVID and building back better.""

Scots voted against independence in a referendum in 2014 but with Britain's subsequent departure from the European Union, the movement has gained fresh momentum since Scotland wanted to stay in the bloc.

Waving red and white Georgian flags, protesters marched through the city centre and gathered outside parliament to protest at Melia's detention and call for fresh parliamentary elections after a contested vote in the South Caucasus country last year. 
Police on Tuesday detained Melia, chairman of the United National Movement (UNM) opposition party, after storming its offices and clashing with his supporters.
Melia has been accused of inciting violence at street protests in June 2019, a charge he dismisses as politically motivated.
The case prompted Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia to step down and warn that Melia's detention could to exacerbate political divisions in the country of 3.7 million. 
The United States and other Western countries have voiced concern at Melia's detention and said it could harm the prospect of dialogue between the opposition and the ruling party.
European Council President Charles Michel is set to visit Georgia next week as part of a three-country visit that will also include Moldova and Ukraine. 
Michel will meet officials including Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili -- chosen by parliament on Monday to replace Gakharia -- as well as members of the opposition. 

Georgian Dream won a parliamentary election in October last year, but the opposition said the vote was rigged and marred with violations. Melia said at the time that his party did not recognise its outcome and called for a re-run.

LONDON (Reuters) - A UK-born woman who went to Syria as a schoolgirl to join Islamic State should not be allowed to return to Britain to challenge the government taking away her citizenship, because she poses a security risk, Britain's Supreme Court ruled on Friday.
Shamima Begum left London in 2015 when she was 15 and went to Syria via Turkey with two school friends. While there, she married an Islamic State fighter. She gave birth to three children, all of whom died as infants, and is now being held in a detention camp in Syria.
She was stripped her of her British citizenship in 2019 on national security grounds.
Friday's unanimous Supreme Court ruling overturned a decision by the Court of Appeal last year, which had held that she must be allowed to return so that she can have a fair appeal against the citizenship decision.
""The right to a fair hearing does not trump all other considerations, such as the safety of the public,"" said Robert Reed, the President of the Supreme Court. ""If a vital public interest makes it impossible for a case to be fairly heard, then the courts cannot ordinarily hear it.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed the ruling, his spokesman said, adding the government's priority was ""maintaining our national security"". 
Begum's case has been the subject of a heated debate in Britain, pitting those who say she forsook her right to citizenship by travelling to join the militants against those who argue she should not be left stateless.
Human rights groups said Britain had a duty to bring back Begum and others in similar straits, and prosecute them for any crimes they may have committed, rather than leaving them abroad.
""Abandoning them in a legal black hole – in Guantanamo-like conditions – is out of step with British values and the interests of justice and security,"" said Maya Foa, director of campaign group Reprieve.
After travelling to Syria, she lived in Raqqa, the capital of Islamic State's self-declared caliphate, where she remained for four years until she was discovered in a detention camp. 
She is now in the Roj camp, run by Syrian Kurdish authorities, where the U.N. rights experts said this month conditions were ""sub-human"".
Reed said Begum's appeal of the citizenship decision should be put on hold until she was in a position to play an effective part in the case without endangering the public.

""That is not a perfect solution, as it is not known how long it may be before that is possible. But there is no perfect solution to a dilemma of the present kind,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States carried out air strikes authorised by President Joe Biden against facilities belonging to Iranian-backed militia in eastern Syria on Thursday, in response to rocket attacks against U.S. targets in Iraq, the Pentagon said.
The strikes appeared limited in scope, potentially lowering the risk of escalation. It was not immediately clear what damage was caused. 
Syria did not immediately comment, but state-owned Ekhbariya TV said the strikes were conducted at dawn against several targets near the Syrian-Iraqi border. 
An Iraqi militia official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least one fighter had been killed and four others were wounded. 
A medical source at a hospital in the area and several local sources told Reuters 17 people had been killed. That toll could not be independently confirmed. 
Biden's decision to strike only in Syria and not in Iraq, at least for now, gives Iraq's government some breathing room as it investigates a Feb. 15 attack that wounded Americans.
""At President (Joe) Biden’s direction, U.S. military forces earlier this evening conducted air strikes against infrastructure utilized by Iranian-backed militant groups in eastern Syria,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said in a statement.
""President Biden will act to protect American and Coalition personnel. At the same time, we have acted in a deliberate manner that aims to de-escalate the overall situation in both eastern Syria and Iraq."" 
He said the strikes destroyed multiple facilities at a border control point used by Iranian-backed militant groups, including Kata'ib Hezbollah and Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada.
After the strikes, the Iranian and Syrian foreign ministers spoke and underlined ""the need of the West to adhere to U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding Syria,"" Iranian government website Dolat.ir said.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the decision to carry out the strikes was meant as a signal that Washington wanted to punish the militias but did not want the situation to spiral into a bigger conflict. 
The official said Biden was presented with a range of options and one of the more limited responses was chosen. 
STRIKES ""REMIND"" IRAN 
Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House of Representatives' foreign affairs committee, said the strikes ""remind Iran, its proxies, and our adversaries around the world that attacks on U.S. interests will not be tolerated.""
Suzanne Maloney, of the Brookings Institution think tank, declared the strikes a ""Good move"" on Twitter, saying they showed the Biden administration could both negotiate with Iran on the nuclear deal and push back against the militias Tehran backed.
The rocket attacks on U.S. positions in Iraq were carried out as Washington and Tehran seek a way to return to the 2015 nuclear deal abandoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump.
It was not clear how, or whether, the strike might affect U.S. efforts to coax Iran back into a negotiation about both sides resuming compliance with the agreement.
In the Feb. 15 attack, rockets hit the U.S. military base housed at Erbil International Airport in the Kurdish-run region, killing one non-American contractor and wounding a number of American contractors and a U.S. service member. 
Another salvo struck a base hosting U.S. forces north of Baghdad days later, hurting at least one contractor.
Rockets on Monday hit Baghdad’s Green Zone, which houses the U.S. Embassy and other diplomatic missions.
The Kata'ib Hezbollah group, one of the main Iran-aligned Iraqi militia groups, denied any role in the rocket attacks.
Some Western and Iraqi officials say the attacks, often claimed by little-known groups, are being carried out by militants with links to Kata'ib Hezbollah as a way for Iranian allies to harass U.S. forces without being held accountable.
Since late 2019, the United States has carried out high-profile strikes against Kata'ib Hezbollah in Iraq and Syria in response to sometimes deadly rocket attacks against U.S.-led forces. 

During Trump's presidency, tensions culminated in the U.S. killing of Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani and a retaliatory Iranian ballistic missile attack against U.S. forces in Iraq last year.

Alexander Lukashenko, who had served as the head of the Belarusian Olympic Committee since 1997, claimed his sixth presidential term in August last year in a vote the opposition says was rigged and marred with violations.
The 66-year-old, who denies electoral fraud, has been accused of orchestrating a massive crackdown on protesters who took to the streets in the wake of last year's contested election, as well as targeting elite athletes who openly backed the opposition. 
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said in December last year the leadership of the Belarusian Olympic Committee had ""not appropriately protected the Belarusian athletes from political discrimination.""
It banned Lukashenko and his son Viktor, first vice president of the national Olympic body at the time, from attending the Games and excluded them from all other IOC activities. 
""The IOC will wait for the official report about the election results and will evaluate them in due course,"" the IOC told Reuters in response to a request for comment on Friday about Viktor Lukashenko's appointment. 
Speaking at a meeting of Belarus' Olympic body, Alexander Lukashenko said he had not planned to remain at the committee's helm for another term and suggested his son Viktor, who also serves as his aide on national security, take over. 
""I still won't be very far away for issues related to sport,"" Belta news agency quoted Alexander Lukashenko as saying.
Alexander Lukashenko is an avid sports fan, and regularly plays ice hockey with senior Belarus officials and occasionally with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network (APRRN) said in a statement it had confirmed that two children were separated from their families and deported back to Myanmar alone on the ships. 
APRRN, along with three other rights groups, also said there was substantial risk that those deported included refugees and asylum-seekers fleeing ethnic conflict and persecution in Myanmar, where the military seized power in a Feb. 1 coup. 
""There is great fear that life for these ethnic minorities deported back to a military regime will likely worsen,"" the groups said.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - The party of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele is expected to win a sweeping victory in Sunday's legislative and municipal elections, stoking the opposition's fears that Bukele could consolidate his control.
Opinion polls show Bukele's new party, New Ideas, and its allies will win between 43 and 56 out of a possible 84 seats. A simple majority would give the ruling party the power to propose constitutional changes. A two-thirds majority would allow it to appoint high-level government officials, such as the attorney general and five of the 15 Supreme Court justices.
Bukele, a 39-year-old publicist and city mayor, took office in 2019 promising to root out corruption and upend the two-party politics that has dominated since the end of the civil war in 1992.
Bukele has been limited by his weak presence in Congress, with only 10 seats held by the Grand Alliance for National Unity (GANA), the party that backed his presidential bid.
The right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) has the most with 37 lawmakers followed by the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). 
Bukele has clashed with both the legislature and the Supreme Court. During the coronavirus pandemic, his government clamped down on public information requests and, in defiance of the judicial branch, authorized security forces to use lethal force while carrying out official duties.
Bukele's opponents are worried that he will further consolidate power if he wins a congressional majority. Bukele says his rivals are fearful because his policies threaten their privileges. 
The president has won popular backing by almost halving homicides in the violence-plagued Central American nation last year, as well as by providing families with food and economic support to alleviate the impacts of the pandemic. 
""Nayib Bukele knows how to manage his government. As we know, no person is perfect: he has had his pros and cons, but he has managed to take care of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Emilio Martinez, 20, a student in San Salvador.
For Omar Serrano, political analyst at Central American University in El Salvador, the election is consequential for the future of the nation of 6.4 million people that has struggled to build democracy after the coups and war of the 1970s and 1980s.
""What we are going to decide on Sunday is whether to deepen democracy or return to absolute power, focused on the ... president,"" he said.

Tensions between the legislative and the executive branch flared in February 2020, when Bukele brought armed soldiers into the Congress to pressure lawmakers to approve a $109 million loan to finance a plan to combat powerful gangs. The relationship worsened in November after lawmakers accused Bukele's government of corruption in managing public funds, including for health care.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Carrying a big speaker at protests that have rocked Barcelona since another rapper was jailed for glorifying terrorism and insulting royalty, Alex Reis hands the microphone attached to it to anyone who wants to make some noise.
""I'm not here only for him, but for the right to express ourselves and because there's a lot of discontent about things that must change,"" said Reis, 25, referring to the nine-month sentence that Pablo Hasel began to serve last week.
Hasel's case has galvanized a debate over freedom of expression in Spain, prompting the government to announce it would relax free speech laws that ban ridiculing of religious beliefs and insults against the monarchy as well as the glorification of armed separatist movements.
For Reis - a jobless rapper who sings on trains to make ends meet - and others involved in demonstrations that have at times turned violent, Hasel's imprisonment has also served to channel growing frustrations over a range of other issues.
They include job insecurity, anger at the political establishment or feeling victimised during the pandemic.
""The Hasel case has been the spark that has set the fire ablaze,"" said protester Sergi Prat, 19, of the rallies that have helped ease the mood of ""depression, anger and apathy"" that recession and the COVID-19 crisis have generated.
Prat, who has a temporary job as warehouseman, said thousands of young people like him were fed up with poor employment prospects and not being able to afford to leave home.
'SOMETHING'S NOT WORKING'
Hit hard by the pandemic with over three million cases and close to 70,000 deaths, Spain enforced a strict lockdown last year, when the economy shrank by a record 11%.
That in turn hit employment, notably among the under-25s, of whom 40% were out of work last year, more than any other European Union country.
Hasel is Catalan, and the northeastern region has been the focal point of the protests against his jailing.
That comes as no surprise to Carles Feixa, social anthropology professor at Barcelona's Pompeu Fabra University. The region has experienced a decade of separatist-driven political instability as well as particularly harsh COVID-19 restrictions.
Beyond that, he says, Spain could be turning its young generation into a lost one, if widespread concerns about the residual effects of the 2008/9 financial crisis and a future where uncertainties about the pandemic and climate change loom large are not addressed.
""It would be a mistake to believe these (protests) are occasional outbreaks that get repressed and end,"" he said, arguing that young people feel increasingly ignored and that, for some, burning trash containers and clashing with police during the Hasel protests was simply a cry for attention.

""It's clear that something is not working ... Young people have not suddenly gone crazy. There are reasons behind all of this,"" said 21-year-old protester Pablo Castilla, a student who believes he will struggle to find a job.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden will visit Texas on Friday as the state works to recover from a devastating winter storm that caused serious damage to homes and businesses, left millions without power or clean water for days, and killed at least two dozen.
Biden and his wife, first lady Jill Biden, will travel to Houston, where he will meet with officials, including Republican Governor Greg Abbott, to discuss the recovery from last week’s storm. He will also visit a COVID-19 health center where vaccines are being distributed.
The president will bring empathy and pledges of financial help from Washington, but no lectures about the dangers of underregulation or calls for the federal government to monitor the state's power grid. 
""There’s plenty of time to have a policy discussion about better weatherization, better preparations, and I’m sure that’s one that will be had. But right now, we’re focused on getting relief to the people in the state,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Thursday.
The disaster has been a test of Biden's pledge to work for all Americans to help unify the country. Abbott initially did not recognize the Democrat's November election victory over Republican President Donald Trump. Texas state officials lost a court bid in December to overturn the results, which Trump has falsely claimed were tainted by widespread fraud.
For 10 days this month, Texas was hit by an unusually prolonged period of very low temperatures. Electricity consumption surged, while many generating units failed to start up owing to frozen instrumentation, iced turbine blades and insufficient fuel supplies.
The state's Republican leaders have come under fire for not heeding warnings that the state's power grid needed significant upgrades to defend against deep freezes. 
While much of the rest of the United States features electricity systems that are interconnected, allowing power to cross state lines, Texas has long stood out for having its own grid. 
Last week, Abbott asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Biden to issue a major disaster declaration for all of the state's 254 counties. Biden initially signed off on a declaration for 77 counties, adding 31 more on Monday and signaling he was open to increasing the number.
The declaration authorizes FEMA to provide grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners.
Biden delayed a visit to the state to avoid hampering efforts to save people from the storm's damage. 

""Now we're at the recovery stage where we need to make sure people have access to clean water, access to places to live and to stay. And so the president wants to survey the damage so he can tap into all the resources of the federal government,"" Psaki said on ""The View"" TV program on Thursday.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran is threatening to end a deal struck with the U.N. nuclear watchdog last weekend temporarily salvaging much monitoring of its activities if the agency's board endorses a U.S.-led push to criticise Tehran next week, an Iranian position paper shows.
Tehran this week scaled back cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, ending extra inspection measures introduced by its 2015 nuclear accord with major powers. It was the latest of many steps retaliating for U.S. sanctions reimposed after the United States pulled out of that agreement in 2018. 
Iran and U.S. President Joe Biden's administration are now locked in a standoff over who should move first to save the unravelling 2015 deal. Tehran says Washington should lift sanctions first. Biden wants Iran to undo its many retaliatory breaches of the deal's nuclear restrictions first.
In its own paper sent to other IAEA member states ahead of next week's quarterly meeting of the U.N. watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors, the United States said it wants a resolution to ""express the Board's deepening concern with respect to Iran's cooperation with the IAEA"".
The U.S. paper obtained by Reuters said the board should call on Iran to reverse its breaches of the deal and cooperate with the IAEA to explain how uranium particles were found at old, undeclared sites - finds first reported by Reuters and confirmed in an IAEA report this week.
""Iran perceives this move as destructive and considers it as an end to the Joint Understanding of 21 February 2021 between the Agency and the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" Iran said in its own paper sent to other countries and obtained by Reuters, referring to its weekend deal with IAEA chief Rafael Grossi.
That, in turn, ""may lead to further complications in relation with the JCPOA"", it said, referring to the 2015 deal by its full name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, adding that France, Britain, Germany and the United States had ""revealed their plans"" for a board resolution.
Diplomats said it was still unclear whether the board would adopt a resolution. In June, after the IAEA said Iran had denied it access for snap inspections at two sites where it later found uranium particles, the board passed a resolution calling on Iran to relent. Russia and China opposed it.
Iran has not listed the measures it stopped implementing this week but they include the so-called Additional Protocol enabling the IAEA to carry out snap inspections at undeclared locations. 

The weekend deal keeps the recording of extra data as specified by the 2015 deal for up to three months, with the IAEA potentially accessing it at the end.

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 05:30AM ET</span>",Spain's former king pays 4 million euros in back taxes amid scandals,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's former King Juan Carlos, who left the country in August amid a cloud of scandals, has settled a back tax bill worth more than 4 million euros ($4.9 million), El Pais and El Mundo reported on Friday. 
It was the second such payment by the former monarch in recent months.
The tax settlement of 4 million euros was based on 8 million euros worth of goods and services he received, the newspapers said. According to El Pais, the payment was to compensate for private flights from which he benefited.
In Decemebr, he paid the tax authorities more than 678,000 euros including interest and fines, which, according to El Pais, sought to settle alleged illegal credit card transactions with the revenue service to avoid being charged in an investigation and to be able to return to Spain.
Juan Carlos' lawyer was not immediately available for comment, while a palace spokesman declined to comment. Through his lawyers, he has over the past months repeatedly declined to comment on corruption allegations.
Prosecutors at Spain's Supreme Court have opened several investigations into Juan Carlos' business dealings, including those linked to a high-speed train contract in Saudi Arabia.
His son, King Felipe, is the current head of state. Spanish monarchs have immunity during their reign but Juan Carlos' abdication in 2014 in favour of his son potentially leaves him vulnerable to prosecution.
Asked about Juan Carlos, Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said the government can not comment on any citizen relationship with the tax authorities, but added: ""No one is allowed to break the law. This comment is even more relevant today.""
Alberto Garzon, consumer rights minister and member of leftist party Unidas Podemos, was more blunt, saying on Twitter: ""It is striking how many surprises we are faced with every month with the obscure - and also illegal - financial movements made by the institution that should be the most scrutinised in the whole of democracy, as it is the most protected and privileged: the monarchy."" 

Juan Carlos has been living in United Arab Emirates since he left Spain. He played a key role in guiding Spain to democracy when he came to the throne after the death of right-wing dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975, but his popularity waned amid a series of financial and family scandals, leading to him stepping down.

1478,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 04:55AM ET</span>",China expected to unveil hike in military budget as tensions rise,"By David Lague and Yew Lun Tian
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China is expected to reveal a robust increase in defence spending at the March 5 annual opening of parliament, as its economy rebounds from the COVID-19 pandemic and military tensions rise, Chinese and Western security experts said.  
With the coronavirus hammering its economy, China last year announced a 6.6 per cent boost in defence spending to $178 billion, the lowest rate of increase in three decades.
The new administration of President Joe Biden has moved quickly to remind Beijing that the United States intends to compete with China's growing influence and military strength in the Asia-Pacific. In recent weeks, powerful U.S. warship fleets have sailed near Chinese-claimed Taiwan and through disputed territory in the South China Sea, to Beijing's anger.
""China is facing the most severe security situation since the Korean War,"" said Ni Lexiong, a retired professor at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law.
He predicts a substantial hike in China's military budget, citing U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, regular deployments of U.S. aircraft carriers off the China coast and the recent presence of a French warship and nuclear submarine in the South China Sea.
""Looking at public opinion, it has become more urgent to take back Taiwan militarily. That is why the budget will surely rise sharply,"" he said. 
Ross Babbage, a non-resident fellow at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and former Australian defence official, expects a rise of about 7%.
""That is less than some people might expect and the reason for that is the Chinese economy is still not in great shape."" 
China's economy grew just 2.3% in 2020, although it was the only major economy not to contract, and is expected to see growth of 8.4% percent this year, a Reuters poll found.
China's Defence Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. 
UNDERSTATED TOTAL
Many Western experts believe Beijing's real military outlays are far higher than official figures.
China's published military spending for 2019 was $174 billion adjusted for inflation, or 1.3 per cent of GDP, according to an annual Pentagon report in September. That excludes outlays on research and development and foreign weapons buying, and the Pentagon estimated that real spending in 2019 could be more than $200 billion.
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimated China spent $261 billion on its military in 2019.
The United States spent $732 billion, or about 3.4% of GDP, on its military in 2019.   
If Beijing does announce a sharp increase, it would signal an intention to intensify military operations against Taiwan or assert Chinese sovereignty over other disputed territory in the South China Sea or East China Sea, Babbage and other Western analysts said.
Wang Xiangsui, a retired senior colonel in the People's Liberation Army and a professor at Beihang University in Beijing, said a rumour last year that the United States was considering a plan to use MQ-9 drones to attack islands or reefs in the South China Sea in a so-called ""October Surprise"" would have given China a keener sense of crisis about the security situation.
Beijing took the rumour seriously enough to seek formal clarification from the Pentagon and subsequently publicised U.S. denials, he added.
Wang said U.S. moves to restrict Chinese access to military equipment and technology would force China to invest more on homegrown research and development.  

""The U.S. military wants to preserve its overwhelming advantage in nuclear and space, and China wants to upset this. More spending is definitely needed,"" Wang said.

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 04:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Two rights groups quit Hong Kong as security law sends shudders through NGOs,"By Pak Yiu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - At least two political rights groups advocating democracy have quietly quit Hong Kong and moved overseas, unnerved by a national security law that has fanned fears over the erosion of freedoms  under China’s rule, sources told Reuters.
    In the past, China-focused rights groups had valued the wide-ranging autonomy, including freedom of speech and assembly, guaranteed for Hong Kong when control over the former British colony was returned to Beijing in 1997.
    But some non-government organisations (NGOs) say the new legislation means they face a choice of either having to leave Hong Kong or work with the same kind of fears and constraints they would encounter in mainland China.
    The New School for Democracy moved to Taiwan in September, two months after Beijing imposed the contentious security law on its freest city. Founded by Wang Dan, an exiled student leader of the crushed 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, the group focuses on bringing together activists from mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong in order to promote democracy in Chinese society. 
    ""Our organisation often criticises the Chinese government, and we participate in Hong Kong's democracy fight,"" Xing Zhong, the group's secretary-general, told Reuters. ""We were quite concerned about the safety of our staff."" 
    Another reason the NGO has moved, according to a source with direct knowledge, is that the NGO receives sizable funding from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a Washington-based group that pro-Beijing newspapers Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao often label as a subversive agency.
    Wang declined to say whether his group received funding from NED, but said the authorities could now bar groups like his from having access to funds.
    ""Bank accounts opened by NGOs in Hong Kong banks are in danger of being frozen at any moment,"" Wang said, noting that  authorities in Hong Kong had blocked the accounts of leading  pro-democracy activists. 
    ""That is why I believe that Hong Kong today is no longer suitable for the existence and activities of NGOs.""
    The Hong Kong government and Beijing's representative office in the city did not respond to a request for comment. 
    Under the broadly-defined security legislation, crimes such as subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorism can be punished with up to life in jail.
     Since the law was implemented in June, scores of pro-democracy activists have been arrested, legislators disqualified and books removed from library shelves as part of a sweeping crackdown on dissent.
    ARTICLE 54
    Concerns over funding for NGOs have also intensified.
    Global Innovation Hub, a unit of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, a German think-tank that was expelled from China in 1997, also moved to Taiwan in September, citing safety concerns for staff.
    The group, which promotes liberal democratic values without being specifically focused on China, has close ties to Germany's Free Democratic Party, and feared that it could have been considered a ""foreign agent"" under the new security law.
    Anna Marti, the head of Global Innovation Hub, told Reuters that Taiwan was now the best place in the region for the group to work on topics such as the digitalisation of democracy.
    Marti said the national security law had weakened a confidentiality ""firewall"" that had previously protected staff.
    Some groups have switched to more secure forms of communication such as encrypted messaging platforms like ProtonMail and Signal, while also enhancing their cyber security protocols, according to NGO staffers. 
    Article 54 of the law authorises the national security bureau in Hong Kong ""to strengthen the management of and services"" of NGOs, a vague clause that critics say mirrors legislation introduced by Beijing in 2017 to give authorities more power to regulate the activities of foreign NGOs in the mainland.
    ""That's worrying,"" commented an independent human rights researcher who declined to be named, saying it could ""effectively silence many NGOs"" fearful of criticising the government.
    Rights groups, including Amnesty International, have become  more cautious about signing joint statements, vetting their words carefully to avoid risks, 10 sources within Hong Kong's NGO community told Reuters.
    Roseann Rife, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Operations said the group had no intention of leaving Hong Kong, while noting the extra risk stemming from the new legislation.

    ""The national security law defines its offences very imprecisely,"" Rife said. ""And it is therefore difficult to have legal certainty about how one might be violating it.""

1482,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 04:05AM ET</span>","I left Britain to escape toxic press, Prince Harry says","By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry has said he stepped back from his royal duties because the ""toxic"" British press had been destroying his mental health, adding he had not walked away from public service.
Last week, Buckingham Palace announced that Queen Elizabeth's grandson and his American wife Meghan had made a final split with the royal family, and would not be returning as working members and would lose their patronages.
Harry, 36, and Meghan, 39, sent shockwaves through the monarchy in January 2020 when they announced their intention to step back from royal duties and embark on a new life across the Atlantic.
""It was never walking away. It was stepping back rather than stepping down, there was a really difficult environment as I think a lot of people saw,"" Harry said in an interview with James Corden, host of the ""Late Late Show"" in the United States.
""We all know what the British press could be like, and it was destroying my mental health, I was like this is toxic. So I did what any husband and what any father would do is like, I need to get my family out of here."" 
Before they moved to California, the couple had complained about the British tabloids' treatment of Meghan, whose father is white and mother is African-American, some of which they said amounted to bullying or racism.
Earlier this month, Meghan successfully sued one tabloid for breaching her privacy by printing extracts of a letter she wrote to her father while last month Harry won a libel case against the same paper over a story which said he had turned his back on the military.
Critics of the couple, who announced this month they were expecting their second child, have said they are keen for publicity but only on their own terms. An in-depth interview they have given to U.S. chat show host Oprah Winfrey is due to be aired on March 7.
There was also disapproval of Harry and Meghan's response to last week's split when they said they were committed to a life of service. Some commentators contrasted their life with the duty shown by the 94-year-old queen during her 69-year reign.
DECISIONS 'ON THE OTHER SIDE' 
""And as far as I'm concerned whatever decisions are made on that side, I will never walk away,"" said Harry, who commentators have said was unhappy with losing his treasured royal patronages, particularly those connected to the military in which he served for 10 years. 
""But my life is public service so wherever I am in the world it's going to be the same thing.""
During his interview, carried out on a tour of Los Angeles, Harry told Corden that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s hit series ""The Crown"", a fictional account of the life of the queen and her family, was ""loosely based on the truth"".
""It gives you a rough idea about what that lifestyle, what the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything else, what can come from that,"" he said.
""I'm way more comfortable with the Crown than I am seeing the stories written about my family or my wife, or myself, because ... that is obviously fiction, take it how you will, but this is being reported on as facts because you're supposedly news.""

Harry also revealed his one-year-old son Archie's first word was ""crocodile"" and said the queen had sent him a waffle maker as a Christmas present.

On one occasion he left his room to meet his Singaporean partner Agatha Maghesh Eyamalai, who was not in quarantine but had booked a room in the same hotel. Skea was also not wearing a mask, which is required in Singapore.
Eyamalai, 39, who married Skea in November, was sentenced to one week imprisonment for abetting him.
The couple had both pleaded guilty and their lawyer S.S. Dhillon said they would not appeal the sentencing.
The city-state has largely brought its coronavirus outbreak under control, with less than a handful of new local cases a day, due to strict quarantining of arrivals, contact-tracing and social distancing.
Singapore requires most arrivals to undergo 14 days of quarantine at government-designated hotels. Quarantine violations can be penalised with a fine of up to S$10,000 or up to six months in jail, or both.
The island nation has jailed and fined others for breaking COVID-19 rules, while some foreigners have also had their work permits revoked.

Authorities said the two gangs have for years been kingpins in the drugs trade in the eastern state of Thuringia, running a network that distributed crystal meth and weapons.
The offices of a lawyer in the central state of Hesse were also raided.
MDR said that its own investigations had revealed that the raids were the result of two years of tapping and bugging operations by security services.
The Turonen and Garde 20 are recognisable by their wearing of black clothes with far right nationalist insignia on them. They have become major players in the promotion of far right heavy metal concerts, at which neo-Nazi bands from Germany and other countries perform.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 03:15AM ET</span>",Kazakh pop stars Ninety One break 'taboo' on political lyrics,"By Olzhas Auyezov
ALMATY (Reuters) - References to George Orwell and Aldous Huxley are not exactly what one expects to hear in a pop song, least of all in the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan where the political scene has been dominated by one party for almost three decades.
So when Ninety One, a popular local band, released a song and a music video titled ""Taboo"" in the final days of 2020, it was likely to attract attention from beyond their usual fanbase.
Having garnered more than 3 million views on YouTube, the song appears to have struck a chord with Kazakhs fatigued by the pandemic, economic woes, corruption and a lack of meaningful political competition.
Written mostly in Kazakh, the song uses intricate wordplay to make references, among others, to President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and powerful former President Nursultan Nazarbayev, before listing some popular grievances.
""Orwell would not have been surprised by our country, Huxley would have been silent and in full agreement,"" go the lyrics, referring to the authors of the dystopian science fiction novels ""1984"" and ""Brave New World"".
The song mentions the endless depreciation of the tenge currency and the ""dementors"" of state procurement - twinning the wraithlike soul-suckers from the Harry Potter books and movies with an area of public life commonly regarded as the domain of corrupt officials.
""Say 'Neo, wake up!' and you're a dissident,"" it goes on - a nod to the Keanu Reeves cult movie ""The Matrix"" - before making an apparent reference to a widely criticised decision to celebrate Nazarbayev's 80th birthday last July with fireworks amid a spike in COVID-19 cases and deaths.
Authorities of the capital city Nur-Sultan - named after the ex-president - defended the move by saying the fireworks had been prepared in advance, paid for by private sponsors and meant to lift the spirits of medical workers. Kazakhstan held a national day of mourning for COVID-19 victims a week later.
'SELF-CENSORSHIP'
Ninety One, whose name refers to the year oil-rich Kazakhstan gained independence, have always been mavericks on the former Soviet republic's pop scene.
Shunned by local TV stations, the band have relied on YouTube and social media to establish themselves as mainstream trendsetters of the ""Q-Pop"" - the country is spelt ""Qazaqstan"" in its own Latin script - genre.
Also unusually, Ninety One never perform at the private parties that are a key source of income for many Kazakh performers.
The band's producer, Yerbolat Bedelkhan, said while the idea of releasing a song focusing on social issues has been on the table for a long time, the band was guided to a large extent by what they were hearing from fans.
""Our fans are young people and the voice of the youths must be heard,"" he said in an interview. ""Music is soft power.""
According to band member Zaq, the song, produced in collaboration with local rap band Irina Kairatovna, also highlights self-censorship adopted by Kazakh society in general and showbusiness in particular.
""Why 'Taboo'? Because it seems we are not allowed to say many things,"" he said. ""But nobody has actually said that this is not allowed... It is people themselves who think that they must not say certain things.""
Fellow band member Ace described the track as an exercise in ""musical journalism"".
In contrast to the rest of the lyrics, the song's chorus is optimistic, with lines such as ""dark days are over, there is no limit ahead"".
However, at the end of the music video, in which all performers are sat at a round table, everyone angrily leaves the meeting, refusing to shake hands with the two chorus performers - who some viewers saw as symbolising Tokayev and Nazarbayev.
The band and its producer, however, won't comment on the song's allegories, referring to its own lyrics: ""The meaning is in your head and these are just letters"".

Dimitris Lignadis resigned as head of the National Theatre this month and turned himself on Saturday after an arrest warrant was issued following lawsuits filed against him by two men who say he raped them when they were minors.
The case, which follows other sexual abuse allegations in Greek cultural life and sports in recent weeks as part of a delayed #MeToo movement, prompted Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to announce that his government will toughen laws to combat sexual abuse and protect minors.
Lignadis has denied all allegations. After hearing his plea for several hours, prosecutors decided that Lignadis be placed under preventive detention, his defence lawyer, Alexis Kougias, said.
The case ""truly has no evidence"", Kougias told reporters outside a prosecutors' office. ""I am sure that in the end this person will be freed.""
Kougias has described the evidence against Lignadis a ""crude fabrication"".

Lignadis has filed for his arrest warrant to be revoked. His objection has been rejected.

1490,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 03:00AM ET</span>",Thai court grants bail to three convicted ministers ousted from cabinet,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - A Thai court granted bail on Friday to three ministers stripped this week of cabinet posts after convictions for insurrection over anti-government protests that culminated in a 2014 military coup, their lawyer said.
The three, and five prominent political figures, were among 26 leaders of a group, the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), who were convicted and jailed on Wednesday by Thailand's Criminal Court.
Under the Thai constitution, the convictions cost Digital Minister Puttipong Punnakanta, Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan and Deputy Transport Minister Thaworn Senneam their posts in the cabinet of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who first came to power in the 2014 coup. 
The PDRC figures were convicted of insurrection, obstructing elections and invading government property during street protests opposing the government of Yingluck Shinawatra, before Prayuth, then the army chief, overthrew her government. 
The PDRC was pivotal in uniting royalist and nationalist forces to pave the way for the rise of Prayuth, who made himself prime minister and retained the post after a 2019 election that opposition parties say was rigged in favour of the military. Prayuth's government says the process was free and fair.However, an appeal court deemed there was no flight risk posed by the ministers, along with PDRC leader and former deputy prime minister Suthep Thaugsuban and four others.
The court set bail at 800,000 baht ($26,368) each, Sawat Charoenpon, a lawyer representing the group, told reporters, adding that they had denied the charges and planned to appeal.
Court officials could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Prayuth has said he will appoint next week acting ministers for education, digital and deputy transport, before deciding on a reshuffle after talks between the ruling Palang Pracharat Party and its coalition partners.

1491,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 02:55AM ET</span>",Disaster in the Himalayas: how a rare February landslide left more than 200 dead,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A landslide 20 kilometres west of Nanda Devi, India's second-highest peak, resulted in a flash flood on Feb. 7 that left more than 200 dead, and swept away two state hydro-electric projects, according to satellite imagery reviewed by Reuters.
Avalanches and flash flooding in the Himalayas are common during summer and monsoon months, as melting snow and heavy rains combine. But incidents like this are rare so early in the year, alarming scientists studying climate change that is rapidly heating the world's highest mountains.
Scientists are still studying the details of exactly what happened, but said heavy snowfall followed by bright sunshine led to snow-melt in the area.
That could have triggered a chain reaction that led to an avalanche and heavy flow of ice, water, rocks and debris surging down the Dhauliganga River valley and destroying villages. While at least 70 bodies were recovered, the state government has formally declared that another 136 people missing are presumed dead.
Dave Petley, Professor of Geography at The University of Sheffield, told Reuters that there was a reduction in the amount of snow, which could have helped trigger the landslide, but not enough to cause downstream flooding.
""There was clearly a thaw event happening at the time of the landslide. But this looks to be superficial snow only, not large volumes,"" said Petley, who studies landslide events.
The disaster has prompted calls by environmental groups for a review of power projects in the ecologically sensitive mountains. Experts say rampant construction is adding to the burden weighing on rural communities across the Himalayas, especially in areas close to glaciers.

1492,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 02:50AM ET</span>","Don't be selfish - get a COVID shot, says UK's Queen Elizabeth","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's 94-year-old Queen Elizabeth, who last month had her first COVID-19 vaccination dose, has encouraged the public to follow suit, saying it did not hurt and those who were wary should think of others.
The monarch and her 99-year-old husband Prince Philip, who is currently in hospital with a non-COVID infection, received their shots from a household doctor at the queen’s Windsor Castle residence, with their age putting them in the priority group for England’s coronavirus vaccine rollout.
""Once you've had a vaccine you have a feeling of you know, you're protected which I think is very important and as far as I could make out it was quite harmless,"" the queen said in a video call with health officials overseeing inoculations across the four nations of the United Kingdom.
""It was very quick, and I’ve had lots of letters from people who have been very surprised by how easy it was to get the vaccine. And the jab – it didn’t hurt at all,"" she added, likening the virus to a plague.
More than 18.6 million Britons have already received their first COVID-19 vaccine injection, and celebrities including singer Elton John and actor Michael Caine have joined campaigns encouraging people to take up offers to have the shot.
Britain's vaccines minister said this week that between 11% and 15% of the public were hesitant about getting the shot, particularly among ethnic minority groups, amid conspiracy theories around the inoculations.
""It is obviously difficult for people if they've never had a vaccine because they ought to think about other people other than themselves,"" said the queen, who described Britain's rollout of the vaccination, one of the fastest in the world, as ""remarkable"" 
Other members of the royal family, including heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and his son Prince William, have been visiting vaccination centres over the last fortnight to thank staff and volunteers for their work.
It comes, though, amid concern over the health of Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, who was admitted to a London hospital last week and has since spent nine nights there receiving medical attention for an unspecified infection.
The palace has said Philip, who turns 100 in June, was comfortable and responding to treatment, but likely to remain in hospital for several days.

On Tuesday, the Duke and the queen's youngest son Prince Edward said he was ""a lot better"", and the day before William said his grandfather was ""OK"".

The decision was reached at a lengthy call between the two foreign ministers on Thursday, India's foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday, adding that New Delhi was pushing for an quick resolution to the border crisis.
""A prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of either side,"" India's foreign ministry said in a statement https://mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl%2F33572%2FPhone_call_between_External_Affairs_Minister_Dr_S_Jaishankar_and_Foreign_Minister_of_China_HE_Mr_Wang_Yi=#.YDhzKeqQJYs.twitter citing the conversation between Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar and China's Wang Yi.
On Sunday, both countries said their troops had pulled out from a lake area in the western Himalayan region of Ladakh, where thousands of soldiers backed by tanks and artillery have been facing off since April.
As per an agreement announced by India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in February, the two countries will now hold talks to end close proximity deployments in other parts of Ladakh.
""Once disengagement is completed at all friction points, then the two sides could also look at broader de-escalation of troops in the area and work towards restoration of peace and tranquility,"" the foreign ministry statement said.
The standoff in Ladakh began last April, when India said Chinese soldiers had intruded deep into its side of the Line of Actual Control, or the de facto border. 
China said its troops were operating in its own area, accusing Indian soldiers of provocative actions.
In June, troops clashed in Ladakh's Galwan valley, where hand-to-hand combat left 20 Indian soldiers dead. Last week, Beijing said that four of its soldiers had been killed in the clash.
India and China share an undemarcated 3,800-km long border, where their troops previously adhered to longstanding protocols to avoid the use of any firearms.

The baby died of cardiac arrest in the northern Romanian city of Suceava after the traditional ritual, which involves immersing children in holy water three times.
Prosecutors are investigating the case, which has divided Church officials and believers, with tens of thousands of Romanians petitioning the Church to sprinkle water on the babies' heads instead. The majority of Romania's 20 million people are Orthodox Christians and the Church has considerable influence.
""Romania's Orthodox Church has a statutory obligation to maintain dogmatic, sacramental and disciplinary communion and unity with the universal Orthodox Church,"" the Holy Synod, its ruling body, said in a statement, adding that it is urging its priests to be more responsible. 
The Synod also said priests have an obligation to meet with parents before the baptism and discuss their children's health conditions while theology schools will give ""heightened attention"" when teaching the immersion practice.

Another refugee was missing, External Affairs Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said on Thursday, giving news of the rescue.
The United Nations refugee agency had raised the alarm earlier this week over the missing boat, which had set off on Feb. 11 from Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh, where refugee camps have been established for hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who fled neighbouring Myanmar.
After four days at sea the boat's engine failed, and those on board had run out of food and water, Srivastava said. Many were ill and suffering from extreme dehydration by the time they were rescued. 
Two Indian coast guard ships were sent to help the refugees, 23 of whom were children, and the Indian government is in discussions with Bangladesh to ensure their safe return, he said.
India is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, which spells out refugee rights and state responsibilities to protect them. It does not have a domestic law to protect the more than 200,000 refugees it currently hosts, including some Rohingya from Myanmar.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled to Bangladesh after a deadly crackdown by security forces in Myanmar in 2017. 
""Bangladesh is respectful of its international obligations under the UNCLOS (The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea),"" Bangladesh's foreign ministry said in a statement.
On earlier occasions when other littoral countries of the region repeatedly denied access to the Rohingyas adrift on the sea, it was the Bangladesh that came to the rescue, the ministry added.
The statement said the boat had been traced approximately 1,700 kms away from Bangladesh and 147 kms from India.
""Other states, particularly those on whose territorial water the vessel has been found, bear the primary responsibility and they should fulfil their obligation under international law and burden-sharing principle,"" the ministry said.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 02:16AM ET</span>","In Iraq's Biblical lands, scattered Christians ask 'should I stay or go?'","By John Davison
MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - A jihadist message, ""Islamic State endures"", is still graffitied on the front gate of Thanoun Yahya, an Iraqi Christian from the northern city of Mosul, scrawled by Islamist militants who occupied his home for three years when they ruled the city.
He refuses to remove it, partly in defiance of the militants who were eventually beaten by Iraqi forces, but also as a reminder that Iraq's scattered and dwindling Christian community still lives a precarious existence.
""They're gone, they can't hurt us,"" said the 59-year-old, sitting in his home which he reclaimed when Islamic State was driven out in 2017. ""But there aren't many of us left. The younger generation want to leave.""
The stark choice facing many Christians in Muslim-majority Iraq will be highlighted during the first ever papal visit to the Biblical nation. Pope Francis's trip runs from March 5-8 and will include a stop in Mosul.
Yahya sold the family's metalwork shop to pay a ransom for his brother, kidnapped by al Qaeda militants in 2004 at a time when Christians were being abducted and executed.
Since then, he has watched siblings leave for foreign countries and work and income dry up.
Of 20 relatives who once lived in the neighbourhood, only his family of six remain.
Iraq's Christians have endured unrest over centuries, but a mass exodus began after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and accelerated during the reign of Islamic State, which brutalised minorities and Muslims alike.
Hundreds of thousands left for nearby areas and Western countries.
Across Iraq's northern Nineveh Plains, home to some of the oldest churches and monasteries in the world, the remaining Christians often live displaced in villages that fell easily to Islamic State in 2014 or in enclaves of bigger cities such as Mosul and the nearby self-run Kurdish region.
The Islamists' rule over almost a third of Iraq, with Mosul as their capital, ended in 2017 in a destructive battle with security forces.
'ONLY GOD CAN HELP'
Physical and economic ruin remain. Iraqi authorities have struggled to rebuild areas decimated by war, and armed groups that the government has not been able to control vie for territory and resources, including Christian heartlands.
Christians say they are left with a dilemma - whether to return to damaged homes, resettle inside Iraq or migrate from a country that experience has shown cannot protect them.
""In 2014, Christians thought their displacement would last a few days,"" said Cardinal Louis Sako, head of Iraq's Chaldean Catholic Church.
""It lasted three years. Many lost hope and migrated. There's no security or stability.""
Iraq's indigenous Christians are estimated to number around 300,000, a fifth of the 1.5 million who lived in the country before the 2003 invasion that toppled Sunni Muslim leader Saddam Hussein.
Christians were tolerated under Hussein, but singled out for kidnappings and killings in the communal bloodshed of the mid-2000s onwards.
Pope Francis is to visit Iraq on an historic trip that eluded his predecessors. He will say a prayer for the victims of conflict at a site in Mosul where old churches lie in ruins, once used as religious tribunals by Islamic State.
Christians welcome the visit, but do not believe it will improve their lot.
""The pope can't help us, only God can,"" Yahya said.
DISPLACED, DISTRUSTFUL
Yahya's family, who fled to Iraq's northern Kurdistan region during Islamic State's rule, is one of just a few dozen that have returned to Mosul out of an original population of some 50,000 Christians, according to local clergy.
His two teenage sons help out at the local church, the only one fully repaired in Mosul, which fills to about half its modest capacity on Sundays.
Firas, his eldest, finds little more than a day a week of casual labour and sees no future in Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. 
""If I want to marry, I'll have to leave. Christian women from here are displaced to other areas and don't want to come back,"" he said. ""Ideally, I'd go to the West.""
The experience of Islamic State, which told Christians to convert, pay a tax or be killed, and the inability of Iraqi and Kurdish security forces to prevent the group marauding through their hometowns, has left many Christians distrustful of any but their own.
The nearby Christian town of Hamdaniya boasts its own militia, which local officials say is necessary because of the proliferation of Shi'ite Muslim paramilitary groups which seek control of land, and Islamic State militants who remain in hideouts across northern Iraq.
""If there were no Christian militia here, no one would come back. Why should we rely on outside forces to protect us?"" said a local militia leader, who requested anonymity.
Nearly 30,000 Christians, half of Hamdaniya's population, have returned, including a small number from abroad, and began rebuilding infrastructure thanks to foreign aid. It is a rare bright spot.
In the neighbouring village, Christian leader Sako said most Christians were unable or unwilling to return out of fear of a local Shi'ite militia, and because non-Christians had bought their property in their absence.
Some have showed interest in resettling in Hamdaniya, but local officials generally reject this, fearing it would weaken Iraqi Christians' presence.
""If people move here from their own villages, it empties those areas of Christians,"" said Isam Daaboul, the mayor of Hamdaniya.

""This threatens our existence in areas we've been for generations.""

Japan had placed 11 of its 47 prefectures under a state of emergency last month as a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic swept the nation. One of those prefectures, Tochigi, has already emerged early from the restrictions. 
Emergency coronavirus measures will now be removed in Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Aichi, Gifu and Fukuoka prefectures, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters after a meeting of the government's advisory panel, which approved the move.
""But the lifting comes with conditions,"" Nishimura said, adding that experts on the panel wanted close monitoring of the spread of new strains of the virus and a sufficient supply of hospital beds. 
They also expressed concern about a potential resurgence in cases as restrictions are eased, warning against complacency, he said.
""Especially with young people, there was concern that the lifting would have a psychological impact,"" said Nishimura, who oversees the government's coronavirus response.
""We need to keep strict anti-infection measures in place.""
Under emergency measures, Japan asks bars and restaurants to close by 8 p.m. and companies to strive for more telecommuting. It also suspended a popular ""Go To Travel"" subsidised domestic tourism programme.
Coronavirus infections have fallen significantly since peaking in early January, including in the capital, Tokyo, which is due to host the Summer Olympic Games from late July. The government is hoping to lift the state of emergency in the remaining four prefectures as planned on March 7.

Japan has recorded about 427,000 coronavirus cases and 7,720 deaths as of Thursday, according to the health ministry.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - It was supposed to be a milestone week for Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison that began with the nation's first COVID-19 vaccinations and ended in the country becoming the first to force Silicon Valley giants to pay for news content.
But while Morrison secured two significant victories, he ends the week under intense pressure for his government's handling of a rape allegation and with his working parliamentary majority evaporating.
""It was a big week. He set expectations high and now they have to manage these lows,"" John Hewson, a former leader of Morrison's ruling Liberal party, told Reuters.
""Morrison will be worried. His personal standing may still be high, but I can't see how he holds the government together. I think he will call an early election,"" he added.
Morrison has publicly said he plans to hold an election in 2022 but polls have in recent weeks tightened.
A Newspoll conducted for The Australian newspaper earlier this month showed the Liberal party in a dead heat with the opposition Labor party.
The government had enjoyed a strong lead throughout 2020 as Morrison won plaudits for Australia's COVID-19 success that has seen the nation record fewer than 29,000 infections - much lower than many other countries.
Morrison's government also claimed victory in a heated battle with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), passing a law this week that requires the tech firms to pay local news outlets for their content. 
But with COVID-19 anxiety now easing, Morrison's support has ebbed slightly. It now faces significant pressure from an allegation by a former Liberal party worker that she was raped in parliament house.
Brittany Higgins, who went public with the allegation that she was raped by a Liberal party colleague, this week sought a police investigation.
Higgins said she told now Defence Minister Linda Reynolds of the alleged attack, but that she had previously decided not to pursue a police complaint in the immediate aftermath for fear of losing her job.
Reynolds denies pressing Higgins not to pursue a police complaint.
The allegation has fuelled pressure on Morrison to explain why several members of his cabinet were told of the allegation, but he remained unaware until Higgins went public two weeks ago.
""Research shows the woman take these issues very seriously. It may damage the government's standing with them,"" said Rodney Smith, professor of politics at the University of Sydney.
Adding yet more pressure, Morrison's legislative agenda is also under threat after a Liberal party backbencher quit this week.

Craig Kelly, a climate change doubter who has also courted controversy promoting debunked coronavirus treatments, said he would support Morrison in no confidence votes but said he would reject efforts to strengthen Australia's renewable energy target.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The Chinese University of Hong Kong has withdrawn recognition of its student union, saying criticism of the city's national security law by newly elected union leaders may have been illegal.
The move, accusing the union of having ""exploited the campus"" for ""political propaganda"", raises further concern about academic and political freedom in the Asian financial hub after Beijing imposed a sweeping security law in June.
Students have been at the forefront of mass pro-democracy protests in 2019 and authorities are keen to quash dissent in schools and universities, which Beijing and city officials have blamed for fostering anti-government sentiment.
Union leaders ""have made false allegations against the university and exploited the campus for their political propaganda, which...brought the university into disrepute,"" the university said in a statement late on Thursday.
At a midnight news conference, union leader Isaac Lam, 20, said, ""We will continue to pursue democracy and freedom, despite the crackdown.""
In its manifesto, Syzygia, the union's newly elected executive committee, had accused the university of ""kowtowing to the regime"" and vowed to fight it, saying the security law infringed basic human rights and freedom.
After Wednesday's election, the university, which ranks 13th in Asia and 43rd in the world according to its website, said it would stop collecting fees on behalf of the union.
It would also require the student body to register as an independent society to assume legal responsibility for itself.
Members of the union will also be suspended from all other positions on university committees.
Ties between the university and the union had already been sour before the union elections. The university had called in police after a conflict with students over security checks and an unofficial graduation ceremony that turned into a protest. 
Last November, dozens of graduating students, many in black robes and Guy Fawkes masks, staged a peaceful protest on the sprawling campus, carrying anti-government banners and chanting democracy slogans.

Nine people were arrested over the protest, four on suspicion of violating the new law, which sets punishments of up to life in prison for anything China sees as subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces.

Activists and U.N. rights experts say at least one million Muslims are being detained in camps in the remote western region of Xinjiang. The activists and some Western politicians accuse China of using torture, forced labour and sterilisations.
China denies any human rights abuses in Xinjiang and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.
""A genocide on the Uighur minority is occurring in China,"" the Dutch motion said, stopping short of directly saying that the Chinese government was responsible.
The Chinese Embassy in The Hague said on Thursday any suggestion of a genocide in Xinjiang was an ""outright lie"" and the Dutch parliament had ""deliberately smeared China and grossly interfered in China's internal affairs.""
Canada passed a resolution labelling China's treatment of the Uighurs genocide earlier this week.
The Dutch motion said that actions by the Chinese government such as ""measures intended to prevent births"" and ""having punishment camps"" fell under United Nations Resolution 260, generally known as the genocide convention.
Prime Minister Mark Rutte's conservative VVD party voted against the resolution.
""GREAT CONCERN""
Foreign Minister Stef Blok said the government did not want to use the term genocide, as the situation has not been declared as such by the United Nations or by an international court. 
""The situation of the Uighurs is a cause of great concern"", Blok told reporters after the motion was passed, adding that the Netherlands hoped to work with other nations on the matter.
The author of the motion, lawmaker Sjoerd Sjoerdsma of the centre-left D-66 Party, has separately proposed lobbying the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympics away from Beijing.
""Recognising the atrocities that are taking place against the Uighurs in China for what they are, namely genocide, prevents the world from looking the other way and forces us into action,"" he told Reuters in an emailed response to questions.
In a statement on its website, the Chinese Embassy in The Hague said the Uighur population in Xinjiang has been growing in in recent years, enjoying a higher standard of living, and a longer life expectancy.
""How can you call this a genocide?"" it said. ""Xingjiang-related issues are never about human rights, ethnicity or religion, but about combating violent terrorism and succession.""

China's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva accused Western powers on Wednesday of using the Uighur issue to meddle in his country's internal affairs.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A group of Russian diplomats and family members used a hand-pushed rail trolley to leave North Korea this week, amid Pyongyang's strict anti-coronavirus measures, which include blocking most forms of passenger transport across the border.
North Korea has not reported any confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but has imposed crippling border closings, banned most international travel, and severely restricted movement inside the country.
""Since the borders have been closed for more than a year and passenger traffic has been stopped, it took a long and difficult journey to get home,"" Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a post on social media.
The group of eight, including a child as young as 3, travelled 32 hours by train and two hours by bus from Pyongyang just to reach the Russian border on Thursday, the post said.
The group then had to cross the border on foot, loading luggage and passengers onto to a trolley on the train tracks.
Photos and video released by the ministry show the trolley, laden with brightly coloured bags and suitcases, being pushed across a wintry landscape.
Embassy third secretary Vladislav Sorokin was the trolley's ""engine"", the ministry said, by pushing it for more than 1 km, including across a rail bridge over the Tumen River, which divides the two countries.
Ministry officials greeted the group at a border station on the Russian side, where they then travelled by bus to the Vladivostok airport, the post said.
During the past year, the number of foreign diplomats has dwindled, with many Western embassies closing, citing the bans on rotating staff. Those who left often had to negotiate for weeks to arrange for special measures to allow them to depart.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea's first prime minister, Michael Somare, has died aged 84, his daughter said on Friday.
Known as the ""father of the nation"", Somare led the Pacific archipelago to independence from Australia in 1975 and served four times as prime minister.
He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in early February, his daughter, Betha Somare, said in a statement.
She said many Papua New Guineans had embraced her father as their own ""father and grandfather"".
Prior to independence, Somare was the chief minister of the Australian-administered territory of Papua New Guinea. He most recently served as the country's leader briefly in 2011.
PNG is a mountainous and sprawling nation rich in resources and minerals, including oil and gas and gold and copper.
Linguistically diverse, it is one of the largest island economies in the South Pacific, although it has faced economic hardship and internal conflict, most notably during the decade-long civil war in the region of Bougainville that claimed as many as 20,000 lives before ending in 1998. 
PNG Prime Minister James Marape said the former leader was now rested from the ""pain and toils of life"". 
""Our nation honors this great leader, the founding and longest serving prime minister of our country,"" Marape said in a statement, appealing for a week of silence, peace and calm as the country pays its respects.
""He is unmatched by anyone of us who comes after him,"" he added.

Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison wrote in a tweet on Friday that Somare was the founding father of a democratic and independent PNG and ""great friend"" to Australia.

""Over an approximately 24-hour period, on 28-29 November 2020, Eritrean troops operating in the Ethiopian city of Axum killed many hundreds of civilians,” Amnesty said, citing 41 witnesses. 
The rights group said that the mass execution of civilians by Eritrean troops may amount to crimes against humanity.
The Ethiopian government’s emergency task force for the Tigray said on Thursday that investigations into violence in Axum were underway. 
The state-run Ethiopian Human Rights Commission released a statement timed to coincide with the Amnesty report, saying preliminary investigations indicated that Eritrean soldiers had killed an unknown number of civilians in Axum in retaliation for an earlier attack by soldiers of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the region's ousted ruling party. 
Eritrea's foreign minister, Osman Saleh Mohammed, did not respond to requests for comment.
News of the mass killing took months to confirm; communications to Tigray were down for many weeks and media access has been tightly restricted, although that is now loosening slightly. 
Both Ethiopia and Eritrea have previously denied that Eritrean troops were in Ethiopian territory. The TPLF and many residents say Eritrea intervened to support Ethiopian soldiers after the TPLF attacked government bases in the early hours of Nov. 4.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed claimed victory on Nov. 28, the day that TPLF forces withdrew from Mekelle - and the day Amnesty says Eritreans were killing civilians in Axum. 
The rights group said the killings were retaliation for an attack by local militia and that soldiers executed men and boys in the streets and engaged in extensive looting. 
A Tigrayan man working in construction told Reuters that Eritrean soldiers shot dead six members of his family in Axum on Nov. 28, including his 17-year-old brother and 78-year-old father. Since phones were down, he found out more than a month later from residents who had buried them. 
“Everything our family had - all the happiness - has turned to darkness,” he said in an phone interview from the capital Addis Ababa this week. 
Mulu Nega, head of Tigray’s government-appointed interim administration, told Reuters: “The police and the judiciary are investigating.”
Reuters could not reach people in Axum by phone. Communications to Tigray remain patchy, as does electricity. 
Axum is a UNESCO World Heritage site, famed for its tall obelisks and ancient churches, including one reputed to house the Bible's famed Ark of the Covenant.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government is taking new steps to speed up releases of unaccompanied children to parents or other sponsors as the Biden administration grapples with a growing number of underage migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border.
President Joe Biden, a Democrat, earlier this month reversed a policy put in place by former Republican President Donald Trump that allowed U.S. authorities to rapidly expel migrant children caught at the border without their parents. The expulsion policy is still in place for most migrants, including families and individual asylum seekers.
In January, U.S. Border Patrol caught 7,300 unaccompanied minors crossing the border illegally, the highest number of arrests in the month of January in at least a decade and up from 4,500 a month earlier. 
Children apprehended at the border are now subject to a process outlined in U.S. law and standard before Trump's order: they are held briefly in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and then transferred to government shelters before being released to their parents or other adults in the United States. From there, the children can pursue their claims for asylum or other protection in immigration court, some with help from lawyers or sponsors.
On Monday, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reopened an emergency shelter in Texas and is also considering reopening a controversial facility in Florida, a sign of the scramble to find housing for the children. Shelter capacity was greatly reduced due to coronavirus social distancing, and existing facilities are close to full. 
HHS, which oversees shelters for migrant children, is in the process of switching to a new database that could cut hours or days from the time it takes to perform background checks for sponsors, said a department official who requested anonymity to discuss internal operations.
The department on Wednesday sent out new guidance to shelter operators saying they could pay for transportation for unaccompanied minors, including flights, in cases where sponsors cannot pay. Previously, providers needed special approval for that step.
The Biden administration also withdrew this week a Trump administration proposal that advocates said would have kept children in government custody for longer periods of time. 
The proposed Trump changes set a firm deadline for sponsors to submit information to prove their relationship to the child or risk being denied custody, which advocates said could have resulted in more kids stuck in shelters.
The proposal was just ""another way that the Trump administration was trying to frustrate the reunification process,"" said Jennifer Podkul from the nonprofit Kids in Need of Defense, which provides legal representation for children.
The Biden administration simultaneously proposed its own changes this week to several forms used related to custody requests by potential sponsors of unaccompanied children.
As part of the changes, which could go into effect after 60 days, HHS would no longer ask sponsors for their Social Security numbers on the forms.
Such questions could discourage immigrant relatives living in the country illegally from coming forward to claim a child.
MORE CHALLENGES AHEAD
As of Monday, more than 800 unaccompanied children were being held in CBP facilities waiting for transfer to shelters, creating a potentially dangerous health situation, an agency official who requested anonymity to share the information, told Reuters. 
A CBP spokeswoman would not confirm the figures.
On Wednesday night, border agents in South Texas arrested a group of 130 migrants made up primarily of families and unaccompanied children, according to CBP. Arrests of large groups ""have become a common occurrence"" in the Rio Grande Valley, the agency said in a statement.
Chad Wolf, former acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under Trump, said the Trump administration generally sought to step up vetting of sponsors of unaccompanied children.
""We wanted to make sure that we weren’t putting those children in harm's way,"" he said.
The moves by the Biden administration to speed up releases come as the president has faced criticism from fellow Democrats for re-opening emergency shelters used to house children during the Trump administration.
""This is not okay, never has been okay, never will be okay - no matter the administration or party,"" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, tweeted on Tuesday in response to a news report about the opening of the Texas facility.

HHS reduced its available bed space for unaccompanied children by 40 percent to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It now only has around 7,700 available beds, including those at the emergency facility, and 7,100 children in custody, a representative said.

1511,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 04:21PM ET</span>",New York City mayor urges probe of sexual misconduct claims against Governor Cuomo,"By Gabriella Borter and Peter Szekely
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday called for an independent investigation into sexual misconduct accusations against Governor Andrew Cuomo made by a former aide to the governor who is now a candidate for Manhattan borough president.
Lindsey Boylan, who first made the accusations on Twitter in December, wrote a detailed essay published on the web platform Medium on Wednesday that the governor had made several ""inappropriate gestures"" towards her while she worked for the state government from 2015 to 2018, ranging from sending her a rose on Valentine's Day to kissing her on the mouth. 
Cuomo denied the accusations in December and issued another denial on Wednesday. Multiple attempts to reach Boylan were unsuccessful. Neither Cuomo nor Boylan immediately responded to a request for comment on de Blasio's push for an investigation.
""Governor Andrew Cuomo has created a culture within his administration where sexual harassment and bullying is so pervasive that it is not only condoned but expected,"" she wrote in the post on Wednesday, saying that at least two other unnamed female employees have confided to her that Cuomo had acted inappropriately around them but were afraid to speak up.
Reuters was unable to independently confirm her accounts and accusations. 
De Blasio, who has frequently feuded with Cuomo, called Boylan's allegations ""really disturbing"" on Thursday and said they should be investigated by an entity outside of Cuomo’s control.
""When a woman comes forward with this kind of very specific allegations, they have to be taken seriously,"" de Blasio said at a news briefing. We need a full and independent investigation. I want to emphasize the word, independent."" 
It is the second controversy in recent weeks to besiege Cuomo, who rose to national stardom for his leadership at the start of the pandemic, when New York was the country's COVID-19 epicenter. 
A report from the state attorney general's office last month cast doubt on the Cuomo administration's handling of the COVID-19 crisis in nursing homes, claiming the state health department had significantly undercounted the toll and implemented policies that may have contributed to it. 
Later, a top aide to Cuomo admitted to lawmakers that the administration had delayed providing requested data about the state's COVID-19 death toll among nursing home residents for fear of a politically motivated investigation by the Justice Department under the then-president, Republican Donald Trump.
The nursing home controversy has spawned some bipartisan criticism of Cuomo among New York lawmakers, and Democratic State Assemblyman Ron Kim of Queens is leading a call for Cuomo's impeachment. A few Republican members called for Cuomo to resign after Boylan's accusations surfaced on Wednesday.
""As we said before, Ms. Boylan's claims of inappropriate behavior are quite simply false,"" Caitlin Girouard, a spokeswoman for Cuomo, said in a statement on Wednesday.

Girouard did not address many of Boylan's claims but denied her account of a plane trip in October 2017 when she alleged that Cuomo suggested they play strip poker. Several government officials who were on each flight with Cuomo and Boylan that month said they did not hear such a conversation, according to the statement.

1512,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 04:16PM ET</span>","In Pennsylvania, Republican rift over Trump imperils party’s election chances","By Nathan Layne and Joseph Ax
EXTON, Pa. (Reuters) - C. Arnold McClure chairs the Republican Party in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania - deep in Trump country - and wants to punish fellow conservatives who have turned against the former president.
McClure is among those pushing the state party to censure Pennsylvania's Republican senator, Pat Toomey, for voting this month to convict Donald Trump, at his second impeachment trial, of inciting the U.S. Capitol riots. McClure will apply the same standard to any Republican candidate in upcoming elections who seeks support in his rural county: Those who have defended Trump will pass ""our first litmus test,"" he said. He has a simple question for any who have not: ""What the hell?""
Other Pennsylvania party leaders say that's a great way to keep losing elections - after Republicans ceded the White House and control of both houses of Congress to Democrats under Trump's watch. Shunning Trump's Republican critics ""sends a wrong signal to many of those that are independents or leaning Republican,"" said Sam DeMarco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh.
Those dueling views encapsulate the rift among Republicans in Pennsylvania and nationally that some party leaders, along with opinion polls, suggest could imperil its chances in the 2022 congressional elections. Interviews with two dozen Republican officials, activists and political analysts reveal a deep split over strategy in Pennsylvania - a key battleground that could determine whether Republicans retake the Senate next year.
Republicans face a potentially self-destructive dynamic in statewide races: Trump loyalists may well prevail over moderate candidates in party primaries, but they are more likely to lose general campaigns against Democrats by turning off centrist voters.
""If that primary is going to be a race to the extreme right - and a race to see who is most loyal to Donald Trump - I guarantee you it will be extremely difficult for the Republican Party to win,"" said Gene DiGirolamo, a Republican county commissioner in Bucks County - a Philadelphia suburb - and a former state representative.
A growing number of Republican voters are unhappy with the party's direction, according to a Feb. 18-24 Reuters/Ipsos poll. Nearly half – 48% – of self-identified Republicans believe their party ""has lost its way,"" up 17 percentage points from a similar poll in December. A Reuters review of Pennsylvania state data shows more than 22,000 voters had left the party this year through Feb. 22, compared with fewer than 8,000 Democrats.
Still, many party leaders argue that turning against Trumpism isn't the way forward. Sean Gale, an attorney and fierce Trump backer who has announced a run for Toomey's seat, said the party has tried and failed to win elections with centrist candidates.
""Running a moderate, or a 'Democrat-light' Republican, to attract independents and Democrats is a proven recipe for disaster,"" he said in an email. ""The GOP tried this in 2008 with John McCain and 2012 with Mitt Romney.""
Trump lost Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes in November, four years after his upset victory there in 2016. The former president nonetheless remains the de facto leader of the Republican Party. Trump will deliver his first speech since leaving office at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Sunday in Orlando, Fla. 
Trump spokesman Jason Miller did not respond to a request for comment. A Trump adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump plans to use his political action committee as a ""weapon"" against more moderate Republicans in next year's elections.
""He's still going to have an enormous amount of influence on both the direction of the policy and also in evaluating who is a serious standard-bearer for that message,"" the adviser said.
RISING STAR
The Republican Party's state committee in Pennsylvania met on Wednesday to consider censuring Toomey, but the vote was derailed after a glitch with its electronic balloting system. The party had not yet rescheduled the vote early Thursday.
Trump's brash brand of politics will be on display this Saturday in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, when Lauren Boebert - the gun-toting freshman congresswoman from Colorado - will address gun rights at a party fundraiser.
Boebert, a fierce Trump backer, has amplified his false election-fraud claims. She's also boosted ticket sales for the Pennsylvania fundraiser, said Robert Arena, the county party's executive director.
""The congresswoman is a rising name,"" he said.
Arena and some other Republican leaders downplayed the party rift, arguing it will be more united for the 2022 campaigns after more than a year under Democratic control in Washington.
A pivotal question: Who will they unite behind? Polls suggest Trump's popularity has faded. About 7 in 10 Republicans approved of Trump in a Jan. 8-12 Reuters/Ipsos poll taken during his last month in office, down from as high as 9 in 10 last year.
Still, no other Republican comes close to being perceived as the party's standard-bearer. Reuters/Ipsos polling between Feb. 18 and 24 asked Republican voters to pick from a list of prominent Republicans, not including Trump, who they thought embodied the qualities of an American leader. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a chief Trump backer, polled highest, at 22%. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell - who has recently blasted Trump over his role in the Capitol riots - was favored by just 3%, the same as firebrand congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been widely criticized for promoting conspiracy theories.
REPUBLICAN CIVIL WAR 'CANCELED'
Asked about the attempt to censure Toomey, the party's national Senate campaign organization pointed to comments this week from Senator Rick Scott, its chairman, declaring that the ""Republican civil war has been cancelled.""
""Those fanning these flames, in both the media and our own ranks, desire a GOP civil war,"" he wrote in a memo. ""No, we don't have time for that.""
The infighting won't be so easy to wish away, said John Kennedy, a political science professor at West Chester University in Chester County. The increasingly Trumpian base of Republican voters, he said, will make it difficult for any moderate to win Pennsylvania's party primaries, in which only Republicans vote.
Some analysts and moderate Republicans noted that the party tried nominating Trump-like candidates for Senate and governor in 2018, and they lost by double digits. Others compared the current insurgency to the Tea Party movement that divided Republicans a decade ago, when Tea Party-backed candidates were blamed for party losses in Senate elections.
Howard Merrick, the chairman of the Republican committee in Schuylkill County, a Trump stronghold, said that voters leaving the party are not necessarily just anti-Trump moderates. They also include Trump supporters who are furious with his Republican critics - and who still believe Trump's claims that he lost a rigged election.
""There are people who are very, very mad at everything that happened,"" he said. ""Most are mad at Congress - those senators like Toomey who have not stood up for Trump.""
Yet Merrick believes the effort to censure Toomey would only further undermine the party. ""It hurts us to do this,"" he said.
FROM RELIABLE CONSERVATIVE TO REVILED TRAITOR
Toomey's Senate seat in Pennsylvania is up for grabs because he has announced he will not run for re-election in 2022.
The Senate is currently divided 50-50, with Democrats in power because Vice President Kamala Harris has the tie-breaking vote. Losing in Pennsylvania - widely seen as the most competitive 2022 Senate race - would make it much harder for Republicans to retake the chamber.
The changing perception of Toomey, who declined an interview request, illustrates the party's shift toward Trumpism. Once considered a reliable conservative, he's now reviled as a traitor among some Trump backers. Toomey launched his first Senate run in 2004 against incumbent Republican Arlen Specter, who was ridiculed back then as a ""RINO"" – a Republican in Name Only, an insult now hurled at Toomey.
Many Republicans' demands for absolute loyalty to Trump worry Ryan Costello, a moderate former Republican congressman and Trump critic who is close to launching a bid for Toomey's seat.

""They're demanding absolutism,"" Costello said of Trump's political operation. ""If that's what it takes to get his support, that's a recipe for general election losses.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield hit ""the ground sprinting"" as she arrived in New York on Thursday, just days before the United States takes over the presidency of the U.N. Security Council. 
During her Senate confirmation hearing earlier this month, Thomas-Greenfield stressed the importance of U.S. re-engagement with the 193-member world body in order to challenge efforts by China to ""drive an authoritarian agenda."" 
Beijing has been pushing for greater global influence in a challenge to traditional U.S. leadership. Former President Donald Trump pulled the United States back from international organizations as part of his ""America First"" policies.
""We're clear eyed about the difficult work that needs to be done from elevating human rights to reforming the U.N. itself, to addressing conflicts, old and new around the world,"" Thomas-Greenfield said on Thursday. 
""We look forward to engaging our allies and our partners to get it done,"" she told reporters after presenting her credentials to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. 
Thomas-Greenfield is a 35-year veteran of the U.S. Foreign Service who served on four continents, most notably in Africa.
She joins counterparts with decades of experience in diplomacy from Britain, France, China and Russia which, along with the United States, make up the Security Council's five permanent veto-wielding members.
The United States will take over the monthly rotating presidency of the 15-member Security Council for March. 
""I've not only hit the ground running, I'm actually hitting the ground sprinting,"" Thomas-Greenfield joked. 
Trump was critical of the United Nations and wary of the value of multilateralism. He announced plans to quit the World Health Organization, and pulled out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, a global climate change accord and the Iran nuclear deal. 
President Joe Biden, who took office in January, rescinded the U.S. decision to withdraw from the WHO and returned the United States to the climate agreement.

""Multilateralism is back and diplomacy is back and America is back and we're ready to get to work,"" Thomas-Greenfield.

""In view of the latest scientific studies, the efficacy of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine has been proven,"" Macron told reporters after a virtual European Union summit. ""My turn will come, but I've got time. If that's the vaccine that's offered to me, I will take it, of course."" 
Macron had caused dismay in Britain after being quoted earlier this year as saying the shot appeared ""quasi-ineffective"" among those aged over 65.
The French leader, who is under pressure to accelerate a vaccine rollout in France that is badly lagging Britain's, also said AstraZeneca had failed to meet its delivery targets and that EU leaders were putting pressure on the Anglo-Swedish company.
""We told them, you're not being serious about the commitments you made, because you haven't met them,"" he said. ""We're putting pressure on them so they make up the ground lost and so that a precise timetable is met.""
Reuters reported on Tuesday that AstraZeneca expects to deliver less than half the COVID-19 vaccines it was contracted to supply to the European Union in the second quarter. 
Macron said the EU's export control mechanism for vaccines was satisfactory and helped transparency but should not be used to ban exports, which would be counterproductive. 

Macron also said vaccine passports, as suggested by countries like Greece, would be unfair for young people, who are at the back of the queue for vaccination and could de facto be banned from travelling during the summer holidays.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel has frozen its programme to send COVID-19 vaccines abroad to buy international goodwill, Defence Minister Benny Gantz said on Thursday, after the initiative came under legal scrutiny.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under fire for donating COVID-19 vaccines to foreign allies, while Palestinians complained that, as an occupying power, Israel should be supplying more to them.
Israeli public broadcaster Kan, which earlier this week reported that Israel would send small shipments to 19 countries, said Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit was seeking clarification about the programme.
An official in Netanyahu's office said that after legal questions were raised, Netanyahu's national security adviser had asked Mandelblit to give his opinion.
""I welcome the decision to freeze the transfer of vaccines to other countries,"" Gantz said on Twitter. Gantz is serving in Netanyahu's government while preparing to face off against him in an election next month.
Netanyahu earlier this week defended what has been referred to as ""vaccine diplomacy,"" saying Israel had ""unused""  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccines left over.
""I think it buys goodwill,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. ""I think it is an intelligent decision ... in return for many dividends that we have already received, in many ongoing contacts in many different fields that I will not elaborate about here."" 
Israel has had one of the world's fastest rollouts of COVID-19 vaccines, with nearly half the population already having received one dose.
But centrist former general Gantz said a decision to give away vaccines must be made in the ""proper forums"" and it was not up to Netanyahu to take such action on his own.
VACCINE DIPLOMACY
Earlier on Thursday, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki called Netanyahu's overseas vaccine shipments ""political blackmail and an immoral act,"" accusing Israel of ""exploitation of the humanitarian needs of these countries.""
Israel has so far given 2,000 doses to the Palestinian Authority, arguing that they are responsible for their own healthcare system. The West Bank and Gaza are home to 5.2 million Palestinians.
Palestinians have accused Israel of ignoring its duties as an occupying power by not including the Palestinians in its inoculation programme.
Israeli officials have said that under the Oslo peace accords, the PA health ministry is responsible for vaccinating people in Gaza and parts of the West Bank where it has limited self-rule.
Two close allies of Israel have already confirmed they received shipments, before the program was suspended.
Honduras received 5,000 vaccine doses from Israel on Thursday. A video clip of their arrival was tweeted by President Juan Orlando Hernandez with the message ""Take heart, Honduras!"" 
The country has signalled its intention to open an embassy in Jerusalem, bolstering Israel's claims to the city that it regards as its capital but infuriating the Palestinians, who claim the eastern half of the city as the capital of a future state.
On Tuesday, Czech Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek said his country had received several thousand doses.
The Czech Republic is one of Israel's strongest supporters in the European Union. 
Before it was suspended Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz defended the Israeli action, saying on Thursday that Netanyahu was ""using the fact that we are the first (country) with a surplus"" for political and diplomatic ends. 
""It's un-humanitarian not to give vaccines to someone in need,"" Steinitz said. The doses donated to each country number in the few thousands, he said. 

U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders added his voice to the critics, tweeting: ""It is outrageous that Netanyahu would use spare vaccines to reward his foreign allies while so many Palestinians in the occupied territories are still waiting.""

Some residents have lived there for more than a year under former President Donald Trump's controversial Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for U.S. court hearings.
A new process under President Joe Biden will gradually allow thousands of MPP asylum seekers to await courts' decisions within the United States. Some migrants last week were permitted to cross into San Ysidro, California.
Francisco Gallardo, who runs a migrant shelter in Matamoros and provides humanitarian aid at the camp, welcomed the news that the process had begun in Matamoros, but said it should have come sooner. 
""It's good that they are doing it, but unfortunately coming late,"" he said. 
Freezing temperatures at the U.S.-Mexico border had made the Matamoros camp a priority, the Department of Homeland Security said on Wednesday. 
Migrants at the camp have struggled to ensure proper hygiene and to protect themselves from organized crime, in a state that is one of the most violent in Mexico. 
""The camp was a space that had multiple risks for the migrants,"" said Misael Hernandez, a researcher on migration issues at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte. 

Mexico's migration institute did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court said on Thursday it will reconsider its decision that California's ban on high-capacity magazines violates the right to bear arms under the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment.
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals set aside a decision made last August by a divided three-judge panel against the ban on magazines with more than 10 rounds of ammunition. An 11-judge panel will now consider the case.
Circuit Judge Kenneth Lee, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, had written for the majority that the 2017 ban may have been ""well-intentioned"" following a spate of ""heart-wrenching and highly publicized mass shootings,"" but that it infringed the constitutional right to armed self-defense.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who sought a rehearing, said the law advanced public safety while preserving gun owners' ability to defend themselves. Becerra also said the panel's decision conflicted with the five other federal appeals courts to consider the issue, and well as the 9th Circuit's own precedent.
President Joe Biden has nominated Becerra to serve as U.S. secretary of health and human services.
Lawyers for gun owners opposed to a rehearing said the state's ""draconian"" ban would strip law-abiding people of magazines they have owned without incident for decades.

Becerra's office and lawyers for the gun owners did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lower court judge had stayed the lifting of the ban pending the state's appeal.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland is beginning to see strong early evidence that its COVID-19 vaccine rollout is protecting healthcare workers and care home residents from catching the disease, health officials said on Thursday.
Ireland has administered almost 360,000 vaccines among its population of 4.9 million, so far to healthcare workers, care home residents and most recently people aged over 85. Just over 133,000 of those have received the second of their two doses.
The officials pointed to a sharp fall in the number of healthcare workers contracting COVID-19 to below 300 last week from almost 1,400 in the final week in January.
Ireland is mainly relying on the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and has administered much smaller amounts of the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) shots. 
There were also fewer than 200 cases in care homes last week versus 1,250 three weeks ago while the relative number of deaths in hospitals and homes are falling more rapidly than elsewhere after Ireland suffered its deadliest wave to date last month.
""Very hearteningly, we think we are beginning to see strong early evidence of a protective impact of vaccination on those cohorts that are in the course of being vaccinated at present,"" Ireland's COVID-19 modelling chief Philip Nolan told a news conference.
The government has said if vaccines arrive on schedule, 55% to 60% of people will be fully vaccinated by the end of June.
Nolan added that even though the rate of decline in cases has slowed in the last two weeks, Ireland continued to make ""significant progress"" against all indicators of disease during a lockdown that was extended into April this week.
The reproduction number - the number of people infected by someone with COVID-19 - remained steady at 0.6 and 0.9, despite the near dominance of the more infectious B1.1.7 variant first detected in Britain. 
The number of cases per 100,000 people in the past 14 days has fallen to 226 from a high of over 1,500 less than six weeks ago.

""Continue doing what you're doing. We've gone from a situation where six, seven weeks ago we were the worst in the world and through the actions of people, we are now in the top 10 in Europe,"" Deputy Chief Medical Officer Ronan Glynn said.

1523,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 01:53PM ET</span>",Deadly protests rock Niger over contested election result,"NIAMEY (Reuters) - Supporters of the losing presidential candidate in Niger set several buildings on fire, burnt tyres and threw rocks at the police on Thursday, as the authorities announced that two people had been killed in post-election protests this week. 
The national electoral commission on Tuesday declared ruling party candidate Mohamed Bazoum the winner of Sunday's runoff election with 55.75% of the vote, but his rival, Mahamane Ousmane, a former president, has alleged fraud and claimed he won with 50.3%.
Since then, two people have been killed and 468 detained during protests by Ousmane's supporters in the capital Niamey, Interior Minister Alkache Alhada said.
""They want to wreak havoc,"" Alhada said at a news conference, blaming opposition leader Hama Amadou for the violence. 
There was no immediate response from Amadou, who finished runner-up in the 2016 election. He was barred from running this time because of a criminal conviction and threw his support behind Ousmane. 
The election is meant to lead to the first transition from one democratically elected leader to another following four coups since independence from France in 1960. President Mahamadou Issoufou is stepping down after two five-year terms.
On Thursday, small groups of Ousmane supporters took to the streets again to lob rocks at police and national guard troops, who responded by firing tear gas. Internet access has also been severely limited since Wednesday. 
Some protesters set private houses on fire, including that of Radio France Internationale (RFI) correspondent Moussa Kaka, a Reuters witness said. RFI said in a statement that Kaka and his family were safe. 
Ousmane, who served as president from 1993 until 1996, when he was overthrown by the military, said on Wednesday that he reserved the right to appeal the election result. 
An observer mission from the Economic Community of West African States said the vote was held ""under free, fair, credible and transparent conditions"".

However, it was marred by two attacks that killed eight election workers in parts of Niger where Islamist militants regularly target civilians and the military.

The new interim government is intended to replace Libya's two rival administrations and oversee the run-up to national elections planned for December in a roadmap to end years of chronic chaos and violence. 
""It will be a government of technocrats representing the whole Libyan spectrum,"" designated prime minister Abdulhamid Dbeibeh told a news conference in Tripoli, adding that he had attempted a ""fair distribution"" of posts between the west, east and south of the country.
However, he did not announce any names for cabinet roles after a process of intense negotiations over recent weeks to form a government that could win acceptance across front lines. 
""We are ready to submit the names,"" he said, but had first wanted to propose the structure of the government and its main objectives to the parliament for approval. 
Libya, a major North African oil and gas producer, has enjoyed little peace since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, and the sprawling country has been split since 2014 between rival factions.
DIVIDED 
One is the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) based in the capital Tripoli in Libya's west, while the east is controlled by an administration backed by Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). 
Dbeibeh's new interim government is intended to replace both existing administrations. 
Last month, participants in a U.N. dialogue in Geneva selected Dbeibeh as prime minister along with a three-member presidency council to act as head of state. All four men have pledged not to stand for office in December's election. 
Dbeibeh's proposed cabinet will be put for approval to the House of Representatives, a body that has been divided for years after some of its members broke off to form a rival assembly. 
House of Representative members from both assemblies have been negotiating in recent days for a meeting to discuss the proposed government that could take place in the frontline city of Sirte. 
""We have full confidence in the members of parliament... I am very hopeful that on the day of the session they will approve the government,"" Dbeibeh said. 

""According to our information from the parliament members, I think they are ready to grant the government approval.""

The German Church has been racked by dissent over the decision of the Archbishop of Cologne, Rainer Maria Woelki, to prevent publication of what he said was a flawed report into child abuse.
A second report, conducted by a law firm, which Woelki said does not suffer the same methodological flaws, is due to be published on March 18.
Speaking after the spring meeting of Germany's 27 Catholic bishops, conference chair Georg Baetzing said all of them were intensely aware of the importance of the work of investigating and atoning for past sexual and physical abuse by clerics.
""(We) stand by our commitment to carry out an unbiased investigation and evaluation of sexual abuses of minors in the church,"" Baetzing told a news conference.
""Naturally there is still a lot to do. This matter is by no means resolved and will never be when it comes to prevention. But I reject accusations that bishops have covered things up or done nothing (to address accusations) for years."" 
Woelki's decision not to release the first report sparked outrage in the German Church and particularly in Germany's most prestigious diocese, home to Cologne's vast, vaulting 13th century cathedral.
There have also been allegations that Woelki failed in 2015 to report a suspected abuse case to the Vatican.
City authorities received so many requests from Catholics wanting an appointment to formally declare they were leaving the Church that the server recording the requests collapsed, many media reported. Appointments are fully booked for months ahead.
While the worldwide Catholic Church has for decades been buffeted by allegations of child abuse, the position of the German Church has particular impact.

Thanks to church taxes paid by members, the German Catholic Church is among the world's wealthiest. Moreover, it is the home church of former Pope Benedict XVI, who shaped Church policy through decades of abuse scandals, both as pontiff and as a senior adviser to his predecessor John Paul II.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Opponents of policies used by universities to increase their numbers of Black and Hispanic students asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday to prohibit Harvard University's consideration of race in undergraduate admissions in a case that could end such affirmative action programs.
Students for Fair Admissions, a group founded by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, asked the justices to hear its appeal of a lower court ruling upholding Harvard's race-conscious admissions. A lawsuit backed by Blum accused Harvard of discriminating against Asian-American applicants.
Blum previously backed a lawsuit by a white woman challenging the affirmative action admissions policies of the University of Texas, leading to a 2016 Supreme Court ruling upholding the consideration of race in college admissions.
The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in November ruled in favor of Harvard, deciding that the Ivy League school's consideration of race was not ""impermissibly extensive"" and was ""meaningful"" because it prevented racial diversity from plummeting. A federal judge also ruled in favor of Harvard in 2019.
Legal experts have said the appeal offers the Supreme Court a possible vehicle to end more than four decades of allowing race as a factor in higher education admissions. Now with a 6-3 conservative majority, the court has moved rightward since the 2016 ruling.
""It is our hope that the justices will accept this case and finally end the consideration of race and ethnicity in college admissions,"" Blum said in a statement.
Affirmative action is a policy under which racial minorities historically subject to discrimination are given certain preferences in education and employment. 
Blum's group, which includes Asian-Americans who were denied admission, argued that Harvard's actions violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars racial discrimination under any program receiving federal financial assistance.
Harvard in a statement said its admissions policies are consistent with Supreme Court precedent and it would defend its right ""to seek the educational benefits that come from bringing together a diverse group of students.""
Blum's group sued Harvard in 2014, accusing it of impermissible ""racial balancing"" to make it easier for Blacks and Hispanics to win admission at the expense of Asian-American applicants, and did not narrowly tailor its use of race.
Students for Fair Admissions separately on Thursday sued Yale University, arguing that its race-conscious undergraduate admissions practices discriminated against Asian and white applicants. 
The U.S. Justice Department on Feb. 3, two weeks after Democrat Joe Biden became president, dropped a similar lawsuit that had been filed against Yale by Republican former President Donald Trump's administration.
Yale had no immediate comment.

Many U.S. universities maintain affirmative action programs in admissions, arguing that having a sizable number of minorities enrolled exposes students to varied perspectives and enhances the educational experience for all students.

CARTAGENA, Spain (Reuters) - A shipload of Spanish cattle that had been drifting for months due to concerns over the bovine bluetongue disease docked in Spain on Thursday, the government said, but the fate of the animals remains unclear. 
The Karim Allah left the Mediterranean port of Cartagena on Dec. 17 carrying 895 cattle destined for sale in Turkey. A second ship, the ElBeik, set sail the next day from Tarragona with a cargo of nearly 1,800 cows. 
Even though the cattle had clean veterinary certificates, according to Spain's government, Turkish authorities rejected both vessels and suspended live animal imports from Spain after an outbreak of the insect-borne bluetongue disease was detected in the Spanish province of Huesca.
The Karim Allah tried to find another buyer in Libya but was rejected by authorities there and spent weeks drifting through the eastern Mediterranean, struggling for supplies.
""We tried to get more feed in Tunisia...but they kicked us out. In the end we managed to get more in Sicily after the animals spent several days with only water,"" said Miguel Masramon a lawyer representing Talia Shipping Line, the shipowner.
The ship moored at Cartagena's Escombreras dock. The Agricultural Ministry said specialists have boarded to test the animals.
If the cattle are cleared, they can be resold for live export. But if they are slaughtered on landing on government orders, they cannot be sold for food and the shipment would have to be written off.
In such a case ""the cost could be well in excess of one million euros,"" Masramon told Reuters.
But who owns the shipment is unclear. The exporter, World Trade, says it is not responsible for the cattle as it already sold them, Masramon said. The exporter for Libya, Pinsus Ursa, said it was not responsible as the cattle did not reach Libya, he said.
Reuters was trying to reach World Trade for comment. Pinsus Ursa had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. It was not known who the buyer in Turkey was.
The Spanish Agriculture Ministry said it was waiting to board the ship, check the animals and take the appropriate action.
Meanwhile, samples taken by a private company have been sent for testing in Madrid and Thalia expects the results within a matter of days. Port authorities have impounded the vessel until a full inspection is carried out. 
The Togo-flagged ElBeik faced a similar ordeal and is currently moored off the Turkish Cypriot port of Famagusta, loading animal feed, an official said.
""It is highly likely that the ship will set off for Spain after the animal food shipment process is completed,"" said Demir Ali Deveci, a senior agricultural official in the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.
Authorities did not determine whether there was an outbreak aboard, he added.
Matilde Moro, head of Spain's ranchers association Asoprovac, accused Turkey of spreading false information and called on the Agriculture Ministry to stop all animal trade with the country. 
""I don't want even one more ship to leave for Turkey when Turkey can take such arbitrary decisions,"" she said. 
Animal rights group Igualdad Animal said the case was further evidence of the need to ban live animal exports outright.
""These animals came sick from the Spanish ports. Many of them have already died and those still alive are suffering a hellish ordeal"" Igualdad Animal's director in Spain, Silvia Barquero, said in a statement.

Masramon said only 15 animals had died on the Karim Allah, which he said was a ""success"" given the difficult conditions.

The Qatari statement, published on its Foreign Ministry website, came two days after Reuters reported that closed-door negotiations on the pipeline had reached a breakthrough.
Qatar coming on board publicly gives another boost to the project, which has a 2023 target date for completion.
The plan is for natural gas from the deepwater Leviathan field operated by  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) in the eastern Mediterranean to flow through an existing pipeline into Israel, and from there into Gaza through a proposed new extension.
The European Union has said it would fund the Gaza-side of the pipeline.
Qatar said it ""pledged to provide an amount of $60 million to finance the project to supply the Gaza Strip with the gas necessary to solve the electricity crisis,"" and that ""this amount will be allocated for extending gas pipelines from the Israeli side.""
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh welcomed the pledge and said the pipeline will ""resolve the problem of electricity in Gaza completely.""
With pipeline funding secured, what remains is a gas purchase agreement with the Leviathan field partners.
For years the project was a distant prospect because of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well as internal Palestinian rivalries, but officials said that Israeli, Palestinian, Qatari and European interests have converged in recent weeks making plans more concrete.
Israel and Egypt maintain a tight blockade on Gaza, citing security concerns about the Islamist militant group Hamas, which seized control of the territory in 2007.

Today, Gaza's sole power station produces electricity for around 12 hours a day on diesel, a more expensive and polluting fuel.

PARIS (Reuters) - Canaries, parakeets and zebra finches will no longer chirp from small cages in the shadow of Notre Dame cathedral, after Paris voted to close its 19th-century bird market, deeming it inappropriate for this day and age.
Held on Sundays, the market on the Ile de la Cite island in the Seine river has been a magnet for tourists and Parisians with children for decades, but an animal rights group's campaign against it and plans to renovate the site led to a city council decision to close it.
""The market had become the epicentre of bird trafficking in the Paris region, including of endangered birds,"" Paris deputy mayor Christophe Najdovksi told Reuters. 
""A second reason for closing it is that the conditions in which the birds are presented are no longer acceptable,"" he said. 
Dating from 1808, the bird market is expected to close when the city completes renovation of the flower market hall, with historical cast-iron awnings, on the same spot in 2023-25. 
Until then, bird lovers can still buy a parakeet for 10 euros ($12) or canaries and other songbirds for 25 euros.
The city said 13 people have a licence to sell birds at the market but only seven use it and most of them also sell other things like pet supplies. 
""In coming months, we will help the bird sellers transition towards a new business model,"" Najdowski said. 
Albert Badalamenti, who has been selling birds on the market for 38 years, acknowledged that some sellers were not respecting the rules but said it was up to police to enforce those.
""They said they would recycle us, find us another job. What I fear is bankruptcy. What are we going to do with all this stock?"" he said, pointing at outdoor aviaries holding hundreds of birds at his breeding station north of Paris.
Animal rights activist Amandine Sanvisens of Paris Animaux Zoopolis said the bird market closure is long over due. 
""Animals are not merchandise. They should not be sold like shoes or handbags.""

On Thursday, Hungary reported 4,385 new infections, the highest number this year. 
Hungary's government has extended a partial lockdown until March 15, Orban's chief of staff said earlier in the day.
The next two weeks would be ""exceptionally difficult"", Gergely Gulyas told a government briefing, adding that the pace of vaccinations would accelerate after Hungary started to roll out China's Sinopharm vaccine on Wednesday.
He said Orban was expected to receive a Sinopharm shot next week. 
Hungary, with a population of around 10 million, had reported 414,514 cases since the start of the pandemic, with 14,672 deaths.
So far, just over half a million people have received at least one dose of a vaccine.
All secondary schools have been closed since Nov. 11, as have hotels and restaurants except for takeaway meals, a 1900 GMT curfew has been in place and all gatherings have been banned.
Hungary on Wednesday became the first European Union country to start inoculating people with Sinopharm shots, after rolling out Russia's Sputnik V as part of its vaccination campaign. The Chinese and Russian vaccines have not been granted regulatory approval in the EU.
These shots are now being administered along with the Pfizer-BioNTech, vaccine and shots developed by U.S. company  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Anglo-Swedish firm AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN).

(Reuters) - A Belarusian court sentenced an anti-government protester to 10 years in prison on Thursday, media and activists said, on charges that the opposition says were trumped up as part of a crackdown to keep President Alexander Lukashenko in power. 
Aliaksandr Kardziukou was convicted of attempted murder for attacking security forces who were trying to disperse nationwide protests that erupted last August following a contested election that extended Lukashenko's rule since 1994.
Kardziukou denied wrongdoing, according to local media reports, saying he was confronted by two plain clothes security forces who pulled a gun on him in the city of Brest and killed another protester, Henadz Shutau, as they tried to escape. 
Shutau, who died after being shot in the back of the head, was convicted of attacking security officials while the man who shot him was recognised as the victim in the case.
""A peaceful protester Henadz Shutau was shot dead by siloviki (security forces) in plain clothes last Aug. His friend Aliaksandr Kardziukou witnessed it and ran away,"" exiled opposition figure Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya wrote on Twitter. 
""Today, a court sentenced Kardziukou to 10 years in prison. Murdered Shutau was called guilty, and his murderer was called a victim."" 
The court media press service in Brest, where local reporters said the hearing took place, was unavailable for comment.
In power since 1994, Lukashenko has launched a violent crackdown on protests that has triggered new Western sanctions on Minsk but support from Russia.
Top United Nations human rights official Michelle Bachelet warned on Thursday of a ""human rights crisis of unprecedented dimension in the country"", saying 246 people had been sentenced to jail on allegedly politically-motivated charges as of Feb. 9.
At the same meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Council, 42 countries, including the United States, condemned what they called systematic and massive human rights violations in Belarus.
""The last six months have been tough to witness,"" UK representative Wendy Morton told the council. ""The Belarusian people have had their democratic rights stolen. Over 30,000 people have been detained, over 400 journalists persecuted, over 250 political prisoners are in jail.""
Minsk's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva Yury Ambrazevich on Thursday criticised the report by Bachelet's office as ""highly subjective and simplistic of its views of events in our country"".
Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei said on Tuesday that ""dialogue and mutual understanding are required and not far-fetched accusations or threats"".
Thursday's verdict is one of several recent trials of opposition figures and journalists. Last week two journalists were jailed for filming protests, prompting the European Union to consider more sanctions. 

Also on Thursday a man was sentenced to 4.5 years in jail after throwing unknown objects in the direction of a road in Minsk last August, and a woman was jailed for eight months for biting a policeman, local media reported.

Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, was jailed earlier this month over alleged parole violations related to an embezzlement case he said was trumped up for political reasons, something the authorities deny.
He is due to spend a little over 2-1/2 years behind bars, according to his lawyers.

Vadim Kobzev, one of his lawyers, announced on Twitter that Navalny had been moved from a Moscow jail.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 09:56AM ET</span>","Pandemic, EU billions drive Greece's digital revolution","By Lefteris Papadimas and Renee Maltezou
ATHENS (Reuters) - Before COVID-19, visits to Greece's paper-strewn labour offices were a ordeal of queues and case files, often for basic matters that in less than a year have moved online as the pandemic upended old administrative routines.
""Essentially overnight, two thirds of the visits were no longer necessary,"" said Spiros Protopsaltis, head of OAED, the Organization of Employment and Unemployment Insurance.
Crammed with thousands of folders and blue OAED registration cards spilling out onto desks and floor space, the corridors of the building where he spoke still offer a daunting vision of the challenge to overhauling public services in Greece.
But conservative Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis says he is determined to harness the pandemic to ""leapfrog"" other countries with green and digital reforms to change everything from energy to education.
Greece has long been an online laggard, languishing at the bottom of the European Union's digital economy rankings, but shifts forced by the pandemic and billions of euros from the EU's Recovery Fund may accelerate change.
Around 6 billion euros ($7.34 billion), a fifth of the 32 billion in EU recovery funds that Greece will receive, has been earmarked for the transition. Some 400 projects, from fibre optic networks to reinforcing cybersecurity and improving skills have been outined in a 2020-25 ""Digital Transformation Bible"".
""If we can do everything we've planned in the recovery, it will be truly transformational,"" Mitsotakis told Reuters in an interview.
Similar promises of transformation have been heard before however and years of encrusted bureaucracy as well as a debt crisis that decimated investment will not be swept away easily.
According to a 2019 OECD report, two thirds of Greeks believe they deserve better treatment from state services, which for many, mean dispiriting visits to rundown offices where case files can disappear for years.
Public offices only stopped using fax machines at the start of this year; high speed internet connection is not a given and ancient box-sized computers running on 1990s software are common.
""We still use pens to write,"" said Dimitris, a public sector manager planning to retire after 44 years, who did not want to give his last name in case it complicated the battle he faces to claim his pension.
CALCULATOR AND PAPER
""There are certain prerequisites for Greece to leapfrog as it needs, because right now it lags behind in most metrics,"" said Nikos Vettas, head of the Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research (IOBE) thinktank.
As well as 5G infrastructure, overhauling public sector management and education reforms to improve digital skills were vital. ""If you combine all this then you could have a significant positive effect on GDP growth,"" he said.
Pressure to shake up public services had grown as successive governments battled through the decade-long debt crisis and eye-catching initiatives, such as a unified e-government services platform, have followed. 
""Even before the pandemic, 80% of our services were digital,"" said George Pitsilis, head of the Independent Authority for Public Revenue who says he wants to eliminate any reason to come to a tax office.
""Of course the pandemic was an accelerator,"" he said from one of the authority's modernized Athens offices where video calls have largely replaced in-person visits.
In other areas, progress has been slower. 
For many pensioners, claiming retirement benefits involves long sessions with an official using paper and a calculator to work out how successive reforms - there were at least 13 during the financial crisis - have affected their entitlements.
Many claims are delayed for years and a target to get 80% of the system online this year appears ambitious. ""Getting a pension in Greece is a nightmare,"" sighed Dimitris, the retiring public servant.
But other signs are more hopeful. The government points to investment plans from the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and, although many older people do not use a computer, smartphone features like an e-prescription service launched as the pandemic erupted have proved a hit.
From 1,500 people registered when it opened, there are now around 1.6 million users and nearly a quarter of drug prescriptions are issued online.

""The good thing with digital transformation is you don't necessarily need lots of physical capital,"" said Vettas. ""You need human capital and in that regard one can be optimistic Greece can transform.""

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 08:50AM ET</span>",Philippine police to look into government admission of drug war failures,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine police said on Thursday they were looking into a government review of thousands of killings in the country's ""war on drugs"", after the justice minister made an unprecedented admission to the United Nations of widespread police failures.
Human Rights Watch described Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra's video statement on Wednesday as an ""astounding disclosure"". Guevarra said police had in many cases failed to examine weapons and crime scenes after officers had shot dead suspected drug dealers.
Guevarra's comments to the Human Rights Council mark the first time the government has publicly questioned its own narrative that the thousands of people killed in President Rodrigo Duterte's drugs war were all armed and had resisted arrest.
Activists accuse the government of turning a blind eye to systematic executions and cover-ups by police in a crackdown Duterte once warned could result in 100,000 deaths. Police deny allegations of murder. 
Rights groups and victims' families have urged the International Criminal Court to indict Duterte for crimes against humanity. 
Police spokesman Ildebrandi Usana in a text message said a team had been set up to ""look into and discuss essential issues raised by the secretary"". 
Guevarra in his statement said the ministry had reviewed many incident reports where police said suspects were killed in shootouts. 
""Yet, no full examination of the weapon recovered was conducted. No verification of its ownership was undertaken. No request for ballistic examination or paraffin test was pursued,"" he said.
""In more than half of the records reviewed, the law enforcement agents involved failed to follow standard protocols.""
Contacted by Reuters, Guevarra said he had no further comment, but would build on his remarks ""with concrete positive action"".
Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque, said the findings ""prove that our domestic legal system is working and other institutions should not meddle"".
John Fisher, HRW's Geneva director, said the Philippines was trying to head off an international investigation. 

""If they can admit that their previous denials of police misconduct were false, what else are they hiding?"" Fisher said.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 08:15AM ET</span>",Myanmar: The revolution will be Facebook-lived,"(Reuters) - When he heard soldiers had taken power in Myanmar again, Thar Lon Zaung Htet hurried to the office of his news agency in Yangon, grabbed a few essentials and carefully locked up.
He has not been back.
His work now is on the city streets and his tool is his mobile phone linked to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Live - streaming the nationwide protests against the coup that toppled elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and ended a decade of tentative democratic reforms.
""Despite the difficulties, citizen journalists and media are posting in every possible way,"" Thar Lon Zaung Htet, 37, told Reuters. ""The important thing is we show the world what's happening.""
With established media under ever greater pressure, the story of Myanmar's anti-coup protests is being shaped for its people and the world by journalists and citizens streaming and sharing snippets of video and pictures.
About half of Myanmar's 53 million people use the platform in a country where Facebook became synonymous with the Internet during a decade of reforms since 2011 that transformed what had been one of the world's most isolated states. 
Although Facebook was banned by the junta after it emerged as a plaform for opposition, downloads of VPNs to skirt the block have surged.
""This is very important for the Burmese people,"" said Zayar Hlaing, a veteran journalist and former member of the Myanmar Press Council. ""People need to know what happened where, to whom so they can decide what to do.""
Myanmar's military-appointed information ministry did not respond to a request for comment on livestreaming and the role of citizen journalists.
DOZENS OF STREAMS
Three local outlets alone did 65 Facebook livestreams on Feb. 22, the day of the biggest protests so far. One video from Thar Lon Zaung Htet's Khit Thit Media got more than 185,000 views - one of the most watched clips.
Facebook declined to comment on the role of live video in Myanmar but said the platform has been used around the world by people seeking to raise awareness of social issues and highlight injustice.
On Thursday, Facebook banned the military with immediate effect, citing ""exceptionally severe human rights abuses and the clear risk of future military-initiated violence"" as well as the army's repeated history of violating its rules. The military has not commented on this. 
Thar Lon Zaung Htet became a journalist under the previous junta in 2003, but said that now he was more afraid than ever. Remote working is the rule for all nine staff at his news agency, which is financed by local civil society groups.
""This is the worst situation we have known,"" he said.
Press freedom groups had complained that the environment was getting tougher even under Suu Kyi, with RSF (Reporters without Borders) rankings showing Myanmar falling every year since 2018 - although it was still markedly more open than it had been in the years of censorship and control under full military rule.
At least nine journalists have been detained since the Feb. 1 coup, according to data from Myanmar's Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. All but two have now been released.
Journalists also say they have been chased down, blocked and intimidated by security forces and shot with rubber bullets. A group from 74 Media in northern Kachin State livestreamed their own arrest.
The ruling generals have said they value accurate reporting, but also threatened to withdraw the licences of media that do not stick to demands to stop referring to the ruling council as a ""junta"" and the army takeover as a ""coup"".
The military-appointed government did not respond to questions on media freedom.
A group of independent local media said on Thursday that government statements since the coup contradicted constitutional provisions on free reporting and broadcasting and that they would continue to work in accordance with media ethics.
""DIGITAL RESISTANCE""
Alongside local media, a growing number of activists, protesters and members of the public are shooting pictures to share with the world.
""They are the front of the digital resistance,"" said Emilie Pradichit, founder of the Bangkok-based Manushya Foundation rights group. ""They are the ones disseminating information for all of us. They are also facing the same risk.""
Such videos have become an important source of images for foreign media, including Reuters. 
When security forces opened fire on protesters on Feb. 20 in Myanmar's second city of Mandalay, killing two people, bystanders recorded the scenes from multiple angles. Someone even had a drone.
State media reported that striking shipyard workers attacked police and some ""aggressive protesters"" were hurt due to security measures.
One man described the horror of watching one of the two victim's bleed to death in the dust as he recorded video to share with the world. The amateur videographer did not want to be named for fear of reprisals.
As well as the risk of violence or arrest, just getting the video out is complicated by internet blackouts, which are now in force daily from 1 a.m. to 9 a.m. and have been imposed at other times when tension was high.
Some livestreamers have nonetheless found ways to skirt the blocks on data transmission on local mobile networks - even if the video is sometimes shaky and blurred.

""We will figure the things out in every possible way that we can,"" said Thar Lon Zaung Htet. ""No matter what.""

RAFAH, Gaza Strip (Reuters) - A fleet of yellow Mercedes taxis lines up outside Gaza's newly reopened Rafah crossing into Egypt, polished again and ready to roll, but with no idea for how long. 
Uncertainty is a fact of life in the Palestinian border town, where 4,500 people have crossed into Egypt in the two weeks since one of Gaza's few lifelines to the outside world swung open on Feb. 9.
The opening eased the years-long blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt on the coastal strip, compounded by measures imposed by all sides to halt the spread of COVID-19.
It arose from political manoeuvring: Egyptian-brokered mediation talks between rival Palestinian factions to smooth the way for possible elections.
But the travellers have no idea how long the gate will stay open.
""To me, Rafah crossing is my source of living. If it opens, I live, and I eat and buy clothes,"" said Saif Rusrus, 21, who left school to sell pastries there. ""As long as there are disputes, the crossing will continue to open and close.""
Israel and Egypt cite security concerns for the restrictions, pointing to the fact that Gaza is controlled by the Islamist militant group Hamas.
The two countries allow passage for thousands of workers and humanitarian cases each year, but most of Gaza's two million Palestinians cannot leave.

""Gaza turns into a big prison when Rafah crossing is closed,"" said hepatitis patient Uday Zaanin, 38, as he waited to board the bus.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>",Greece to toughen laws on sex crimes after wave of abuse allegations,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece will toughen laws to combat sexual abuse and protect minors, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Thursday following a cascade of recent scandals in culture and sport.
""Greek society underwent a shock when it began to learn about its hidden facades,"" Mitsotakis told parliament. 
The measures he outlined include stricter penalties for crimes against sexual freedom, changing the statute of limitations for cases of child abuse, creating a registry for professionals who work with children and a website where victims can submit allegations in real time.
A number of allegations have surfaced since January, when Olympic sailing champion Sofia Bekatorou testified in court that she had been sexually assaulted as a 21-year-old in 1998 by a sports official. No case was brought against the man, as the statute of limitations had passed.
But her account - and the outpouring of support it provoked - prompted dozens of actors, singers, athletes and students to come forward in what Greeks have compared to the #MeToo movement in the United States and elsewhere.
The former head of the National Theatre, Dimitris Lignadis, is facing child rape allegations after two men who say he raped them when they were minors filed lawsuits against him. 
Lignadis, who is in custody, is expected to appear before a prosecutor later on Thursday for a plea hearing. He denies all allegations and his lawyer has called them a ""crude fabrication.""
His case has become a major political issue, with the leftwing opposition calling on Culture Minister Lina Mendoni to resign, accusing her of protecting Lignadis.
Mitsotakis said he backed Mendoni and accused opposition leader Alexis Tsipras of seeking to exploit the scandal for ""populist"" purposes.

According to a November survey by Actionaid, 85% of female respondents said they have experienced sexual harassment at work. Another poll last month by ProRata found more than 90% of those who said they had been harassed or abused did not believe they could get any legal redress.

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>",Iran says U.N. investigator lacks authority to comment on downing of Ukrainian plane,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran dismissed as ""immature"" a statement by a U.N. investigator that inconsistencies in its explanation of the shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger plane last year raised questions over whether the act was intentional, Iranian media said on Thursday.
All 176 people aboard the Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752, most of them Canadian, were killed when the plane crashed shortly after takeoff en route from Tehran to Kiev on Jan. 8, 2020. 
Agnes Callamard, the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, said on Tuesday she had found no concrete evidence the plane was targeted intentionally but that Iran had not proven it was accidental.
After denying blame for three days, Iran's Guards said they had shot it down by mistake while under high alert for a possible attack. Hours earlier it had attacked U.S. targets in Iraq in retaliation for Washington's killing of Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, with a drone strike five days before.
Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said Callamard's ""sphere of activity has nothing to do with these regulations and frameworks. Rather, her unwarranted involvement might not have a constructive impact on the legal procedures as well"".
Callamard, who carried out a six-month investigation into the case under her global mandate, said on Tuesday that Iran had not replied to her detailed queries. She is stepping down from the independent post at the end of March, a year early in the six-year term, to take another job, officials said.
Khatibzadeh accused her of rushing out her statement.
""Maybe one of the reasons of this unwarranted haste is her resignation from her post as special rapporteur, and by issuing an immature and impetuous text ... she may have been promised a new job positions,"" Iran's state news agency IRNA quoted him as saying.
""Accordingly, some charges have been levelled against the Islamic Republic of Iran without any valid evidence and documents.”

In December, Khatibzadeh said an indictment would be issued in less than a month against “those whose negligence caused the accident”. But Iran's military court, which is handling the case, has yet to publicly announce it.

1542,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 06:40AM ET</span>","Hundreds of buildings burned around Tigray town, research group says","NAIROBI (Reuters) - Fires that appear to have been deliberately set destroyed more than 500 structures this week in and around Ethiopia's Gijet town, an analysis of satellite imagery shared with Reuters has found, adding credence to reports of continued conflict in parts of the northern region of Tigray.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed declared victory over a rebellious regional force, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), at the end of November after its fighters withdrew from the region's main cities and towns. But sporadic fighting continues in some parts of Tigray, according to residents and United Nations assessments. 
The government has acknowledged isolated incidents of shooting but has said that most fighting has stopped in Tigray. 
Mulu Nega, head of Tigray's government-appointed interim administration, told Reuters he had sent a team to the Gijet area to investigate. 
The DX Open Network, a security research organization based in Britain, analysed images collected by private satellite operator Planet Labs on Sunday and Tuesday around Gijet and three nearby settlements, which are about 35 km (22 miles) southwest of the Tigray regional capital Mekelle. 
They showed at least 508 structures that appeared to have been destroyed by fire over that period, the network said, citing the blackening of earth and vegetation, ash circles indicative of roof collapse, and debris from collapsed walls and ceilings.
A fire detection service run by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which uses visible and infrared imagery captured from space, detected numerous fires in the area on Monday, according to its website.
The DX Open Network said the absence of fire clusters or scorch marks connecting burnt structures in the images it analysed makes it unlikely that the fires were all accidental, and there was no evidence of craters to suggest they might be the result of shelling.
""These factors support the analytic judgment that this was an intentional effort by a conflict party to destroy this civilian habitation area, and not the product of combat,"" it said in its analysis. It was not clear from the images who might have set the fires.
The prime minister's spokeswoman and the head of a government task force on Tigray did not respond to messages seeking comment. Reuters has been unable to reach TPLF officials since early December.
Both sides in the Tigray conflict, which began in early November, have accused each other of abuses and denied responsibility for carrying them out.

Reuters could not reach people in the area by phone. Communications to Tigray remain patchy, and the government tightly controls media access.

Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates formalised ties with Israel on Sept. 15 in part over shared concerns about Iran, in a deal forged by former U.S. President Donald Trump.
Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers, a move praised by Israel which has objected to the accord. His successor, President Joe Biden, wants to rejoin the deal.
But in the week since Washington offered to talk with Tehran about reviving the nuclear deal, Iran has curbed U.N. monitoring and threatened to boost its uranium enrichment. Tehran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons.
An Israeli official said on Tuesday that Israel hopes to prevent personal tension between Netanyahu, who is seeking re-election on March 23, and Biden over their differences on Iran policy by delegating talks on the topic to their senior staff.
Netanyahu and Khalifa both released statements about their telephone call on Thursday but only the Bahraini announcement mentioned Iran.
Their conversation stressed the importance for the ""countries of the region to take part in any talks about Iran's nuclear file,"" the kingdom's state media office said on Twitter.
Netanyahu's office said he spoke with Khalifa about visiting Bahrain once coronavirus restrictions would allow it. 
""The Bahraini regent also stated that he was interested in examining the possibility of Bahrain joining an investment in a vaccine manufacturing plant that is planned to be established in Israel together with other countries,"" the statement said.
Netanyahu said on Wednesday he was in talks with the heads of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) to open facilities in Israel. Neither company responded to Reuters requests for comment. 
Israel has been importing Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Inc COVID-19 vaccines.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Almost six years ago Tareq Alaows drifted across the Aegean in a rubber boat before walking most of the way from Athens to Vienna. Now the migrant who fled military conscription in Syria is trying to win a seat in Germany's parliament.
He plans to run for the Greens in a former coal-mining region of western Germany in a national election on Sept. 26 - as long as his application for German citizenship is approved by then. The Greens say Alaows would be the first refugee elected to the federal parliament.
When Alaows arrived in Germany in 2015, he felt safe for the first time in years. But he was shocked at what awaited him: a bed in a gym alongside 60 other refugees where he was prohibited from working and not given German lessons.
""I realised that my perspective, as someone affected by all this, was missing in politics. No one represents me,"" the law graduate told Reuters in almost perfect German. He taught himself the language by putting German laws into Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Translate on his mobile phone.
Alaows is one of hundreds of thousands of migrants who entered Germany after Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the borders in 2015 to refugees fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond. 
""There were refugees in Germany even before 2015 - they've been here longer - and it's high time that in a functioning democracy these people, who are part of society, get a voice in politics,"" said Alaows, who advises migrants on asylum issues.
""Refugees face systemic discrimination in this society. They're affected by racism and by laws on asylum and residence - those are experiences that refugees share and I want to work on bringing about changes in these areas,"" Alaows said.

Opinion polls put the left-leaning Greens second behind Merkel's conservative bloc.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 06:17AM ET</span>","Special Report: In Germany's Black Forest, Putin critic Navalny gathered strength and resolve","By Sabine Siebold, Anton Zverev, Catherine Belton and Andrew Osborn
IBACH, Germany (Reuters) - Just over two weeks after his poisoning with a military-grade nerve agent in Siberia, Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny began to respond to the words of his wife Yulia and wake from a drug-induced coma.
As he emerged from what he would later describe as days of appalling hallucinations, he found himself in Berlin's Charite hospital, where he'd been evacuated for emergency treatment on Aug. 22. He would later recount how he had to be lifted into a chair from his hospital bed and would sit with his mouth open, staring at a single spot on the wall.
In the months that followed, Navalny withdrew to a remote corner of the Black Forest. He used the time to drive himself back to physical fitness with intense workouts and take his war with President Vladimir Putin to a new level: targeting him directly, for the first time, with a video investigation into a lavish Black Sea palace.
Reuters spoke to more than a dozen people who visited Navalny or communicated with him during his almost five months in Germany. They include financial backers, some of Navalny's top lieutenants and German officials. These people recounted that Navalny never wavered in his single-minded mission to displace Putin, and never entertained staying in the West to wage his campaign from abroad. On the contrary, after concluding that Putin had personally ordered his poisoning, Navalny became even more determined to achieve his goal.
The interviews also shed light on how Navalny kept his political operations going during his brief exile and how supporters financed his emergency care. At least four Russian business and political figures living abroad provided crucial funding.
On Jan. 17, Navalny flew back to Moscow and was immediately arrested for alleged parole violations related to a suspended jail term in an embezzlement case he says was trumped up.
Fallout from Navalny's poisoning and arrest has convulsed Russia's relations with the West, already at a post-Cold War low, with Moscow raising the prospect of a rupture in ties with the European Union and the West weighing new sanctions.
Nationwide protests against Navalny's detention attracted tens of thousands of people in the depths of Russia's winter. But riot police hit back hard, detaining more than 11,000. Facing such a crackdown, it's unclear where Navalny's movement goes next. Some supporters worry it is losing momentum.
Putin, who makes a point of never uttering Navalny's name, has said Russian state security agents would have ""finished the job"" if they had wanted to kill Navalny. The Russian leader has said accusations that he ordered Navalny's murder are part of a U.S.-backed smear campaign targeted at him personally. The Kremlin has even questioned whether Navalny was poisoned at all and queried his sanity.
A HUMAN DUTY
In hospital, Navalny chronicled his slow recovery by posting pictures on Instagram. An image of himself with his wife Yulia smiling, climbing a staircase to train his muscles, resting on a bench outside.
German police kept a watchful eye. Navalny noticed a police officer guarding him in his ward 24/7, he told Russian blogger Yuri Dud in an interview. The German state confirmed it provided protection for Navalny, but appears to have paid for nothing else.
Other bills were picked up by wealthy Russian businessmen, most of them living outside their homeland having fallen out of favour with Russian authorities. These men don't all share the same political views, but they agree on one thing: Russia needs a genuine opposition to challenge a president who has been in power too long.
Boris Zimin, the son of a former Russian telecoms magnate, confirmed to Reuters that he paid for Navalny's medical evacuation to Germany, a cost of 72,000 euros. Navalny has said previously that Zimin, who lives in Israel, pays him an annual salary for legal work. This makes up most of Navalny's 5,440,000 roubles ($73,500) annual income, Navalny has said.
""It's important that Alexei has a legal and clear income,"" Zimin said of the arrangement, likening it to a citizen paying taxation. ""Society gives politicians funds to allow them to work. I don't have close relations with him. We're not close friends. He doesn't owe me anything.""
Zimin first met Navalny more than a decade earlier. At the time, Zimin's father was one of Russia's most celebrated philanthropists. His charitable foundation, which provided grants to young scientists and mathematicians, closed in Russia in 2015 after the Justice Ministry branded it a ""foreign agent,"" or entity, because it banked abroad.
Three other prominent Russians told Reuters they paid medical bills estimated at up to 70,000 euros in total: London-based Yevgeny Chichvarkin, who made his fortune in mobile phones before falling out with Russian authorities; U.S.-based Sergei Aleksashenko, a former deputy chairman of Russia's Central Bank, and Roman Ivanov, an executive at Russian internet firm  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX), who also now lives abroad.
Ivanov said he consulted with his wife before agreeing to transfer an undisclosed sum - ""a fairly large amount but less than a third"" of the total, he said - to Charite hospital. ""I transferred money from my European account, which is registered with the Russian tax service, nothing secret. And in general, it seems to me that there should be no complaints against me. What have I done? I helped pay for a patient's treatment. I didn't finance the revolution, but helped to cure people.""
Ivanov said he doesn't think of Navalny as ""the ideal presidential candidate,"" but ""the same people shouldn't sit in power all the time.""
Aleksashenko, once one of Russia's leading liberal voices, said he ""considered it my human duty"" to make a financial contribution towards Navalny's treatment. Chichvarkin, a long-standing supporter of Navalny, said the two men had a shared outlook. Chichvarkin left Russia in 2008 after law enforcement officials raided his company's central Moscow office.
""IF I DON'T TRY, I'LL NEVER KNOW""
After his discharge from hospital, Navalny resurfaced in mid-October in the Black Forest village of Ibach, set in a high valley. Locals told Reuters he flew in late at night by helicopter.
Navalny moved with his wife and son into an apartment in an upscale complex with views towards the Swiss Alps. Armed police guarded their new home.
Bjoern Leber, a 23-year-old physical trainer, was hired to help Navalny regain his fitness. Leber told Reuters he got the job when one of Navalny's assistants walked into a gym in the nearby town of St. Blasien and asked for a trainer who spoke English and could keep a secret.
At the start, Leber said, Navalny ""had lost a lot of strength. He barely could muster five push-ups, and they were shaky push-ups at that."" He struggled to get into a car.
The two men spent hours boxing, juggling and running. They also used a counter-current swimming pool in the basement spa.
""His motivation was enormous. When we were boxing, and he was genuinely shot, and I told him, 'Come on, another three strikes,' he gave me another three - or even five,"" said Leber.
When not exercising, Navalny worked on his MacBook or went sightseeing. Villagers spotted him hiking or jogging. He was full of questions about German local government, said Ibach's mayor, Helmut Kaiser.
Leber's grandmother gifted Navalny a Black Forest cake, layered with cream and laced with cherry schnapps. Leber recalls asking Navalny if he thought it was a good idea to return to Russia. ""If I don't try, I'll never know,"" was the reply.
By early December, Navalny and his entourage moved to the old university town of Freiburg, near the French border. It was here that Navalny secretly worked on a feature length film with Vladimir Putin as its target. 'Putin's Palace' would allege that Putin is the owner of a sprawling estate on Russia's Black Sea coast. It was released on YouTube on Jan. 19, two days after Navalny's arrest. The 112-minute film has since been watched at least 113 million times.
The central allegation - that the palatial residence had been built for Putin - had been reported before. In 2014, for instance, Reuters documented how two associates of Putin had profited from a program to buy medical equipment for the state and then sent money to Swiss bank accounts linked to the flashy property. Putin's spokesman denied he owned the property then, and continues to do so. https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/comrade-capitalism-putins-palace/
The Navalny video, however, captivated the Russian public in part because of its slick production, aerial shots of the palace and 3-D mockups of its interior. When protesters took to the streets after Navalny's arrest, some brandished gold toilet brushes - a mocking reference to one of the more outlandish luxuries alleged in the film.
Publishing an investigation into Putin personally was something Navalny had been weighing for some time, people familiar with his thinking say. But he worried about the consequences.
""Alexei used to say that when we write about Putin, it will be our last investigation,"" said Ivan Zhdanov, a colleague. ""But, of course, we will continue.""
Vladimir Ashurkov, a long-time associate of Navalny, has lived in London for almost a decade. He sought political asylum in Britain after Russian authorities accused him of embezzlement, a charge he denies and says is politically motivated. ""Going after Putin isn't easy,"" he told Reuters. ""With others you can look at offshore companies and accounts. Putin is careful.""
Ashurkov shared a Zoom dinner with Navalny and his wife a few weeks after Navalny regained consciousness, and he noticed a hardening of his friend's resolve.
""As he became more and more convinced of the involvement of Putin in his poisoning, he became more and more focused on trying to expose"" Putin's actions, Ashurkov said.
This shift in mood was noticed by Christo Grozev, lead investigator of British open-source news project Bellingcat. Grozev interacted with Navalny on another investigation, around the same time as the Putin palace expose, that identified Navalny's alleged poisoners as agents of Russia's FSB intelligence. The Kremlin has dismissed the report.
""He had a strong hypothesis that nobody in Russia would have access to Novichok,"" the chemical used to poison him, ""without the consent of the Kremlin.""
Navalny shot and produced much of his video investigation about Putin at Black Forest Studios in the small town of Kirchzarten.
One of the studio's owners, Nina Gwyn Weiland, told the local ""Stuttgarter Nachrichten"" newspaper that she had no idea who had hired the space until Navalny showed up. The staff was sworn to secrecy, she said. Navalny and his team, of around 20 people, worked long hours, unwinding at the end of the day in the studio bar. Contacted by Reuters, the studio declined to comment further.
Navalny filmed segments elsewhere too. Notably in Dresden outside the apartment where Putin used to live when he worked for the KGB in the 1980s and in Berlin where Navalny visited the archives of the Stasi secret police to see Putin's identity card.
In mid-December, Navalny declared his poisoning case solved.
""I know who wanted to kill me. I know where they live. I know where they work. I know their real names. I know their fake names. I have their photos,"" Navalny said in a video, summarizing the findings of the Bellingcat investigation. ""This is a story about a secret group of murderers from the FSB that includes doctors and chemists.""
A few days later, he announced he had phoned up one of his would-be killers and tricked him into disclosing details of the murder plot, including that poison had been placed in Navalny's underpants. Reuters couldn't independently confirm his assertions.
Russian authorities dropped unambiguous hints that he would be jailed if he returned. These included a move by state investigators to open a new fraud case against Navalny, a charge he denies.
MOSCOW IS MY CITY
Some of Navalny's supporters hoped he would stay out of Russia, at least for a while, for his safety but they soon realized he was determined to return home as soon as possible.
Ashurkov, Navalny's friend in London, said he wanted to plant the idea that Navalny ""has options, that he can engineer a life outside Russia for a while, that he would at least consider it.""
""But when I looked at him and talked to him and started reading what he was writing, I understood that returning to Russia was his sole aim and there was no talking to him about this.""
Zimin, who paid for Navalny's emergency flight from Siberia to Berlin, believes Navalny ""understood that he had a path to remain in Germany and live a normal life. He had already achieved a lot. But he wouldn't have the same influence. And he made his choice. It seems to me he made his choice before he even began to think about what might happen. He acted according to his principles and values, which prevailed over everyday concerns.""
A German official confirmed to Reuters that Navalny made no request to stay. ""We didn't receive an asylum request. He is a free man and he returned out of his own free will.""
Navalny used Instagram to announce his planned return to Russia.
""It was never a question of whether to return or not. Simply because I never left. I ended up in Germany after arriving in an intensive care box for one reason: they tried to kill me,"" Navalny wrote. ""Russia is my country, Moscow is my city and I miss it.""
Having made his flight details public, Navalny was accompanied by a gaggle of journalists on the flight, with his wife, to Moscow. Before arriving, his plane was diverted to another of the city's airports to thwart his supporters who were waiting to greet him.
His arrest was swift. Four masked police officers intercepted him at passport control. Navalny, after kissing his wife Yulia on the cheek, walked away with them.
Two days later, Navalny's allies released their Putin palace video.
At least nine of Navalny's allies inside Russia were then detained one by one for what the authorities said were illegal calls for protests amid a pandemic. Some were put under house arrest, where they remain, cutting them off from the internet and their mobile phones. Others fled the country.
A couple of weeks later, a Moscow court jailed Navalny for nearly three years for parole violations, ignoring a Western outcry over his treatment and nationwide protests that had attracted tens of thousands in the middle of winter.
Some supporters wondered if he should have waited longer before returning, perhaps closer to parliamentary elections that are due in September, when the weather for protests would be better. Chichvarkin, the London-based ally who helped pay for Navalny's treatment, said he counselled caution when he visited Navalny in the Black Forest.
""I advised him to wait because it was dangerous. But he'd already decided everything. It was useless,"" he told Reuters.
Aleksashenko, the former deputy Central Bank chairman, said it was debatable whether the timing of Navalny's return could have been any better. If Navalny had stayed in Germany, he said, six months from now ""the Kremlin – and Kremlin media – would have said: Your team is in prison and you are hiding over there.""
Leonid Volkov, Navalny's chief of staff, based in Lithuania, said the timing of Navalny's return was never in doubt.
""It was always clear that as soon as the doctors said it was possible for him to return, he would have to return. There was no strategizing,"" Volkov told Reuters.
In recent weeks, Russian state media have sought to remind Russians of Navalny's past flirtation with far right groups. In videos from 2007, Navalny likened militants in Chechnya to cockroaches and espoused deporting migrants, saying, ""We have the right to be Russian in Russia and we will defend that right."" In 2008, when a short war broke out between Russia and Georgia, he insulted Georgians, calling them rodents. He would later offer a qualified apology. Navalny has moved away from such rhetoric in the last decade. Allies say these early comments were an attempt to form a broad-based anti-Kremlin alliance, which meant engaging with hardcore nationalists too.
In the latest legal jousting, on Feb. 20 a Moscow court found Navalny guilty of slandering a World War Two veteran. Navalny has said authorities are attempting to tarnish his reputation.
Funding for Navalny and his allies has surged, much of it in hard-to-trace bitcoin donations, according to data reviewed by Reuters. Bitcoin donations worth nearly $300,000 at current prices were received from Jan. 1 to Feb. 11, the data showed. At least two financial backers confirmed to Reuters that they have increased their regular donations.

Navalny's supporters don't expect any rapid change in Russia. Aleksashenko, who helped pay for Navalny's treatment, believes only further mass protests can pose a real challenge to the Kremlin.
Leber, the personal trainer, said he sent Navalny a text message after his return to Russia and arrest. ""Stay strong,"" it read. There's been no reply. ""There are no cell phones in prison,"" Leber said.

YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan warned of an attempted military coup against him on Thursday and called on his supporters to rally in the capital after the army demanded he and his government resign.
The Kremlin, an ally of Armenia, said it was alarmed by events in the former Soviet republic, where Russia has a military base, and urged the sides to resolve the situation peacefully and within the framework of the constitution. 
Pashinyan has faced calls to quit since November after what critics said was his disastrous handling of a six-week conflict between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave and surrounding areas.
Ethnic Armenian forces ceded swathes of territory to Azerbaijan in the fighting, and Russian peacekeepers have been deployed to the enclave, which is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated by ethnic Armenians. 
Pashinyan, 45, has repeatedly rejected calls to step down despite opposition protests. He says he takes responsibility for what happened but now needs to ensure his country's security. 
On Thursday, the army added its voice to those calling for him to resign. 
""The ineffective management of the current government and the serious mistakes in foreign policy have put the country on the brink of collapse,"" the army said in a statement. 
It was unclear whether the army was willing to use force to back the statement, in which it called for Pashinyan to resign, or whether its call for him to step down was just verbal.
Pashinyan responded by calling on his followers to rally in the centre of the capital, Yerevan, to support him and took to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to address the nation in a livestream. 
""The most important problem now is to keep the power in the hands of the people, because I consider what is happening to be a military coup,"" he said. 
In the livestream, he said he had dismissed the head of the general staff of the armed forces, a move that still needs to be signed off by the president. 
Pashinyan said a replacement would be announced later and that the crisis would be overcome constitutionally. Some of his opponents said they also planned to rally in the centre of Yerevan later on Thursday. 
Arayik Harutyunyan, president of the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, offered to act as a mediator between Pashinyan and the general staff. 

""We have already shed enough blood. It's time to overcome the crises and move on. I'm in Yerevan and I'm ready to become a mediator to overcome this political crisis,"" he said.

In a handwritten letter seen by the British broadcaster and dated 2018, Latifa asked Cambridgeshire Police to refocus on the case of her sister Shamsa, now 39, who was captured aged 18 and has not been seen in public since. Reuters has not seen the letter.
The Dubai government's media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Cambridgeshire police confirmed it had received a letter, dated February 2018, in relation to the case and that it was part of an ""ongoing review"".
Latifa, 35, is herself the subject of international concern. In a video message filmed in a bathroom and obtained by the BBC, she said she was being held captive in a barricaded villa.
The UAE last week said Latifa was being cared for at home by family and medical professionals. 
The two women's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, has rejected findings by a London High Court judge who said last year that he accepted as proved allegations that the sheikh had ordered the abductions of his daughters.

Britain has called on the United Arab Emirates to show proof that Latifa was still alive.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's parliament is set to consider legal bids to lift the immunity from prosecution of 21 pro-Kurdish MPs, applying more pressure on a political party targeted in a years-long crackdown and that now faces calls for its closure.
The government accuses the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), parliament's third largest, of ties to Kurdish militants and stepped up its accusations after Turkish captives were killed in Iraq earlier this month. 
The HDP in response criticised President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party (AKP) for using a failed military rescue mission to target it politically and to sow ethnic division, and the European Union has expressed concern over the legal moves. 
AKP Parliament Speaker Mustafa Sentop told reporters on Thursday it was ""saddening"" for parliament to have to deal with so many dossiers with such charges, including ""manslaughter"", ""spreading terrorist propaganda"" and ""provoking hatred"". 
State-owned Anadolu news agency said 20 HDP deputies and one from an affiliated party were among 25 targeted by the cases. The HDP, which has 56 members in the 660-seat assembly, denies links with Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants.
The legal bids will first be handled by a parliamentary commission which will decide whether to put them to a vote in the general assembly. The timing of the process was unclear.
Nine of the HDP deputies were accused in connection with protests triggered by an Islamic State militant attack on the Syrian town of Kobani in 2014. The subsequent protests in Turkey led to the deaths of 37 people. 
Ankara said this month in Iraq's Gara region the PKK executed 13 prisoners, including Turkish military and police personnel, during an army operation meant to rescue them. The PKK said the captives died during clashes.
HDP co-leader Pervin Buldan, one of those accused over the Kobani protests, said this week the government had sought to make political capital out of the Gara operation.
""They began to attack the HDP from all directions. Each day the 'shut down the HDP' chorus continues to cause uproar, show enmity towards Kurds and spread the hatred climate,"" she said.
Erdogan's nationalist allies have repeatedly called for the HDP's closure over links to the PKK, which Turkey, the EU and United States designate a terrorist group. The PKK has waged an insurgency in the mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey since 1984 and more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.
The crackdown on the HDP in recent years has included the arrests of thousands of party officials and members, while dozens of its elected mayors and lawmakers have been ousted.

EU foreign affairs spokesman Peter Stano said earlier this week the EU was ""gravely concerned"" about continuing pressure on the HDP, including ""what seem to be politically motivated judicial proceedings"".

New Delhi (Reuters) - The militaries of India and Pakistan said in a rare joint statement on Thursday that they had agreed to observe a ceasefire along the disputed border in Kashmir, having exchanged fire hundreds of times in recent months.
The nuclear-armed neighbours signed a ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control (LoC) in the Kashmir region in 2003, but the truce has frayed in recent years, and there have been mounting casualties among villagers living close to the de facto border.
""Both sides agreed for strict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the Line of Control and all other sectors with effect from midnight 24/25 Feb 2021,"" the joint statement said.
The return to a truce was settled by the two armies director-generals of military operations.
""In the interest of achieving mutually beneficial and sustainable peace along the borders, the two DGsMO agreed to address each other's core issues and concerns which have propensity to disturb peace and lead to violence,"" the statement said.
There has been a significant increase in ceasefire violations since 2014, leading to nearly 300 civilian fatalities, a source in the Pakistan military said.
""In just two months this year, there have been 253 ceasefire violations in which eight civilians were wounded,"" the source said.
Since the start of the year, India had counted 591 violations by Pakistan.
Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between the neighbours, which claim the region in full but rule only parts. But tensions were renewed after New Delhi withdrew the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir state in August 2019 and split it into two federally administered territories.
""We are cautiously optimistic that the violence levels and tensions along the LoC will come down,"" an Indian official in New Delhi said, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
India's military would maintain deployments along the LoC to prevent infiltration and continue counterinsurgency operations in the Kashmir valley, the official said.
Politicians in Indian Kashmir said they welcomed the commitment to return to a ceasefire, one of the few signs of cooperation in recent years between the neighbours who have fought three full-scale wars since gaining independence in 1947.

""Dialogue is the only way forward if both countries want to stop the unending cycle of violence & bloodshed across the borders and J&K,"" Kashmiri politician Mehbooba Mufti said in a tweet, referring to Jammu and Kashmir.

Intelligence collected ahead of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol suggested that the gathering would have the participation of armed ""militia members, white supremacists, and other extremist groups,"" Yogananda Pittman said in a prepared testimony to be delivered Thursday before the House Appropriations Committee.
Pittman was the assistant chief of police of the department's Protective and Intelligence Operations on Jan. 6 and said she was responsible for its Intelligence and Interagency Coordination Division (IICD).
Trump supporters saw Jan. 6 as the last opportunity to overturn the results of the presidential election and their sense of desperation and disappointment ""may lead to more of an incentive to become violent,"" the IICD said in an assessment issued on Jan. 3, according to Pittman.
""While the Department was prepared to neutralize and remove individuals or groups engaging in civil disobedience or violence among the demonstrators, it was quickly overwhelmed by the thousands of insurrectionists (many armed) who immediately and without provocation began attacking officers, bypassing physical barriers, and refusing to comply with lawful orders,"" Pittman added.
Supporters of Trump stormed the Capitol building in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's electoral victory over Republican Trump, who falsely claimed that the November election had been marred by widespread fraud.
The Capitol attack delayed the certification of Biden's win by several hours, as lawmakers were forced to flee to seek safety from the angry mob that overwhelmed security forces. Five people died in the violence.
More than 200 people have been charged so far for their roles in the riot, including some with ties to far-right fringe groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.

An FBI warning that a protest by Trump supporters could turn violent reached the U.S. Capitol Police the day before the assault, but top officials in charge of securing Congress that day did not see it, they told lawmakers on Tuesday.

Shortly before they appeared in court, the commissioner of police said late on Wednesday that on the basis of available evidence all those connected to the murder had now been arrested.
With members of the journalist's family in the courtroom, Robert Agius and Jamie Vella were charged with complicity in the murder of the journalist, who was killed by a car bomb as she drove out of her home in October 2017.
Three men were accused in December 2017 of having detonated the bomb. One of them, Vince Muscat, admitted his role in the murder in a plea bargain on Tuesday and was jailed for 15 years.
A legal source said Vince Muscat had provided police with vital information about the case, which has shone a spotlight on corruption in the European Union's smallest country.
Millionaire businessman Yorgen Fenech, who is suspected by police of being the mastermind of the murder, was arrested in November 2019 after the murder plot’s middleman, Melvin Theuma, was granted a pardon and implicated him. 
Fenech and all the other remaining accused men have pleaded not guilty. 
Prior to the arraignment, which continued past midnight, Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa told a news conference how the police had found machineguns, shotguns and pistols in searches on Tuesday, although they did not find bomb-making equipment.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 03:47AM ET</span>",Supporters of Myanmar coup attack rival in Yangon,"(Reuters) - Some armed with knives and clubs, others firing slingshot and throwing stones, supporters of Myanmar's military attacked opponents of the coup in downtown Yangon on Thursday, while Southeast Asian governments groped for ways to end the crisis.
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army seized power on Feb. 1 and detained civilian government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and much of her party leadership after the military complained of fraud in a November election.
There have been about three weeks of daily protests and strikes and students planned to come out again in the commercial hub of Yangon on Thursday.
But before many opponents of the coup gathered, about 1,000 supporters of the military turned up for a rally in central Yangon.
Some of them threatened news photographers, media workers and witnesses said, and scuffles soon escalated into more serious violence in several parts of the city centre.
Some military supporters were photographed with clubs and knives. Some threw stones and fired catapults, witnesses said, and several people were beaten by groups of men.
Video footage showed several apparent supporters of the military, one wielding a knife, attacking a man outside a city-centre hotel.
Emergency workers helped the man as he lay on the pavement after his attackers moved off but his condition was not known.
""Today's events show who the terrorists are. They're afraid of the people's action for democracy,"" activist Thin Zar Shun Lei Yi told Reuters.
""We'll continue our peaceful protests against dictatorship.""
The violence will compound worries about a country largely paralysed by protests and a civil disobedience campaign of strikes against the military.
Earlier, police blocked the gates of Yangon's main university campus, stopping hundreds of students inside from coming out to demonstrate.
Doctors were also due to hold a protest as part of a so-called white coat revolution.
Meanwhile, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said that due to the risks evident from the ""deadly violence"" seen since the coup it had banned the Myanmar military from using its Facebook and Instagram platforms with immediate effect.
The spokesman for the ruling military council did not respond to a Reuters telephone call seeking comment.
The security forces have shown more restraint compared with earlier crackdowns against people who pushed for democracy during almost half a century of direct military rule. 
Military chief General Min Aung Hlaing says authorities are following a democratic path in dealing with the protests and police are using minimal force, such as rubber bullets, state media reported.
Nonetheless, three protesters and one policeman have been killed in violence.
A rights group said as of Wednesday 728 people had been arrested, charged or sentenced in relation to the pro-democracy protests. 
The army stepped in to oust the government saying military complaints of fraud in a Nov. 8 election, swept by Suu Kyi's party as expected, had been ignored.
The election commission said the vote was fair. The army said its action was within the constitution and it promised to hold a new election after reviewing voter lists. 
Suu Kyi has been detained incommunicado since the coup, at her home in the capital, Naypyitaw, but her party says its November victory must be respected.
'RESTRAINT'
The question of whether to hold a fresh election has emerged at the centre of the first diplomatic efforts to find a path out of the crisis, with Indonesia taking the lead within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Its foreign minister said on Wednesday she had held intensive talks with the Myanmar military and representatives of the ousted government.
The minister, Retno Marsudi met Myanmar's military-appointed foreign minister, Wunna Maung Lwin, for talks in the Thai capital earlier in the day.
But Indonesia's intervention has raised suspicion among opponents of the coup in Myanmar who fear it will confer legitimacy on the junta and its bid to scrap the November election. 
Retno told reporters the wellbeing of the people of Myanmar was the top priority.
""We ask for everybody to use restraint and not resort to violence,"" she said after talks with the Myanmar minister and her Thai counterpart, Don Pramudwinai.
A Reuters report this week cited sources as saying Indonesia was proposing that ASEAN members send monitors to ensure the generals stick to their promise of fair elections. 
The military has not given a time frame for an election although it imposed a one-year state of emergency when it seized power.
Retno did not mention an election but emphasised ""the importance of an inclusive democratic transition process"".
The crisis has restored Myanmar's reputation as the problem member of the 10-country ASEAN and the diplomatic scramble by its neighbours comes as wider international concern is growing.

The United States, Britain and others have imposed limited sanctions aimed at members of the junta and military businesses.

Berlin's senate department for interior affairs on Thursday said it had banned a ""jihad-salafist"" association Jama'atu Berlin, also known as Tauhid Berlin, and that police had undertaken the raids, without giving further details.
German newspaper Tagesspiegel said the group glorified ""Islamic State"" fighting on the internet and called for the killing of Jews, adding that criminal proceedings were pending against some of its members.
The newspaper added that the group had contact with Anis Amri, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker with Islamist links, who hijacked a truck and drove it into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people in 2016.
Salafists - strict Sunni Muslims - include peaceful private people, activists seeking the implementation of Sharia law and militants advocating violence to establish states they might regard as representing true Islam.
The number of Salafists had risen in Germany to an all-time high of 12,150 in 2019, Germany's domestic intelligence said in its annual report last year, listing them among ""Islamist extremists"".
It said the number of Salafists had more than tripled since 2011 and that the Salafist scene in Germany was going through a consolidation stage, adding that followers were keeping a low profile in public.

LONDON (Reuters) - Heralded by the whirr of its underpowered electric engine and the clink of bottles stacked in crates on the back, Ella Shone's 'Topup Truck' started life ferrying morning milk to the doorsteps of bleary-eyed Londoners.
Twenty years on, and the light vehicle known as a 'milk float' - once a ubiquitous sight on British streets - is enjoying a second career selling a range of goods and serving the 32-year-old's quest to rid the city of single-use plastic.
""The fact that I'm driving around in a milk float does a lot for raising awareness in the local area,"" said Shone, wearing a black beanie during her rounds in the borough of Hackney last week. ""So now I'm operating at almost full capacity.""
Furloughed from her sales job during the coronavirus pandemic last spring, Shone used savings to start her new business, aiming to meet growing demand for household goods free of the plastic packaging used in supermarkets. 
Customers book a visit from the 'Topup Truck' online and then purchase goods such as lentils, pasta, olive oil, shampoo or washing up liquid using their own containers.
From a low base a decade ago, the market for such unpackaged bulk goods could hit at least 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) by 2030 in the European Union, according to a report https://zerowasteeurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2020_06_30_zwe_pfs_executive_study.pdf by Zero Waste Europe, an anti-waste network.
While handling the logistics can be a challenge, Shone calculates that her service has eliminated the need for at least 12,700 pieces of plastic since it launched in August.
Planning a crowdfunder to retrofit her milk float to enable her to serve a greater range of products to more communities, Shone hopes her novel approach will inspire others to find creative ways to tackle waste.
""If we want to have real change, it has to be a collective effort,"" she said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Mafia-type organisations, often based in eastern Europe, are likely to have been behind a recent wave of cyber attacks on French hospitals, rather than foreign powers, said the French minister for digital technology Cedric O on Thursday.
""Concerning the hospitals, in all likelihood it is not foreign powers, but rather Mafia-type organisations - often situated in eastern countries but not just limited to there - who are looking for money,"" Cedric O told France 2 television.
Cedric O said such criminal organisations would typically demand ransom money from victims to restore their computer systems, after paralysing their software.
Cedric O added that the situation at French hospitals had stabilised following the cyber attacks earlier this year, but hospitals at Dax and Villefranche-sur-Saône were still working with pen and paper after their computer systems were hit.
Earlier this month, French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled plans to invest more money into strengthening France's means to fend off cyberattacks.
France's cybersecurity watchdog said on Feb. 15 that hackers had spent up to three years breaking into organizations by targeting monitoring software made by French company Centreon.

""I'm now thinking how to do March salaries if things continue to go this way or get worse. In the worst scenario, I can still pay them in cash.""
Hundreds of thousands of people have rallied for weeks across Myanmar, in a groundswell of anger at the military's overthrow of the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, its curbs on the internet and the arrest of hundreds of activists. 
The anti-coup movement's calls for people not to go to work has caused big disruption, holding up crucial processes like import and export permits, salary payments and bank transfers.
Myanmar relies overwhelmingly on imports for its fuel, but supplies are running low, industry sources say, with some oil import terminals no longer operating.
Its nascent garment manufacturing sector, a key source of income for rural families, faces disruption in raw materials imports and the export of clothing, including orders from major western brands. 
Some businesses have already been forced to slash wages. 
""I didn't receive any business this month so I can only pay them two thirds of their salary,"" said a 33-year-old owner of a Yangon beauty salon, who asked not to be named. 
""If they cannot get cash at ATMs, then I will pay them in cash. For March if things continue this way, I will have to reduce their salary to 50%.""
INTERMITTENT SERVICES
Many businesses have been closing to show support for the movement, or avoid being seen as backing the junta. Many have allowed employees to attend protests during work hours.
Bank services are irregular, with some branches closed, others reducing operations and limiting withdrawals. 
""This is the movement organised by the staff alone,"" said one striking employee of a private bank.
""We don't like the dictatorship. We can't accept it.""
Jared Bissinger, an economist who has specialised on Myanmar, said the crisis would likely lead to payroll problems, reduced wages and overtime and an increase in people borrowing money or selling assets.
A big worry, he said, was the textiles sector and the potential impact on hundreds of factories. 
""I'm deeply concerned about where the economy goes and the vulnerability of a lot of people in Myanmar,"" said Bissinger.
""This economic story and these economic challenges are going to become more front-and-centre in the coming months.""
Win Thein, 56, who runs an electrical store, said the economy was already struggling and would stay that way until the military hands back power in an election, as it has promised. 
""This coup makes it worse. The economy has plummeted to zero. Nothing is turning out to be good,"" he said.
Some in Myanmar no longer have work and are focusing only on protests.
""I'm just trying to survive,"" said engineer Phyo Kyaw, 27, who said he quit his job.

""We want to repel the dictatorship as soon as possible and we are putting all of our efforts into it.""

Vladimir Vasilyev, 52, was arrested in Russia's eastern Siberian Zabaykalsky region that borders Mongolia and China in August 2019. He pleaded guilty to the charge of treason, TASS said. 
His trial was held behind closed doors and its details were not made public because of its classified nature. 
Vasilyev gathered and handed over information that constituted a state secret to China's intelligence services, TASS cited a law enforcement source as saying. 
The case points to the tensions behind the Kremlin's push for closer ties with China since 2014, when relations with the West collapsed over Russia's annexation of Crimea. 
Last year state prosecutors charged a prominent Russian scientist with treason for allegedly passing secrets to China. Another scientist was detained in Siberia last October for allegedly passing technology to China.
There have been a spate of treason cases in recent months. 
One case in particular, that of former newspaper journalist Ivan Safronov who denies wrongdoing, has sparked anger among his supporters about the secrecy surrounding the treason allegation against him that makes it difficult to scrutinise the case.

""The purpose of the meeting will be to determine whether common ground exists for the parties to negotiate a lasting solution to the Cyprus problem within a foreseeable horizon,"" said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
The meeting will take place in Geneva, Switzerland, from April 27 to 29, Dujarric said in a written statement.
Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup in 1974.
The conflict has been a lasting source of tension between NATO allies Greece and Turkey. More recently, it has complicated any effort to tap suspected energy resources around the Mediterranean island.
Geneva's meeting will include the island's Greek and Turkish Cypriot community leaders and representatives from Greece, Turkey and Britain, which were guarantors of Cyprus's sovereignty upon independence in 1960.

Kazakhstan is a major producer of grains, oilseeds and meat in the former Soviet region sandwiched between China and Russia and five years ago, its authorities decided to attract foreign investment into agriculture by opening up the farmland market.
But, unusually for the tightly controlled nation of 19 million people, the plan was met with street protests where demonstrators expressed concerns that giant neighbour China would eventually snap up all the fields and pastures.
The government then shelved the plan until this year. On Thursday, Tokayev said the foreign ownership ban would remain in place.
""The land (ownership) issue has always been very important to our people. It is a cornerstone and a sacred symbol of our statehood,"" Tokayev said at a meeting with an advisory council.
""I order that the sale and leasing of agricultural land to foreigners and foreign legal entities be forbidden. This also includes legal entities with foreign shareholders.""

China is Kazakhstan's key trade partner, creditor and investor, but its growing clout has prompted a rise in anti-Beijing sentiment among locals, which has also been fuelled by reports of a crackdown on ethnic Kazakhs in China's Xinjiang province as part of a ""de-radicalisation"" campaign.

SEOUL (Reuters) - At six in the morning, Heo Kwang-eum tees off another day in Thailand in coronavirus quarantine - literally. He's one of dozens of South Korean visitors spending two weeks in isolation playing golf at a resort an hour north of Bangkok.
The 66-year-old businessman is one of the first group of 41 Korean travellers to arrive in Thailand under a 'golf quarantine' programme devised by the Thai government to boost its ailing tourism sector during the pandemic.
At the Artitaya Country Club, the visitors were tested three days after arrival last week, and face at least two more tests before they can exit quarantine. With bars and other resort facilities closed, there's no prospect of a gathering for Heo and other visiting golf fans to thrash out the missed birdies, bogeys and shanks of the day, but spirits remain high.
""It's a huge golf course here,"" said Heo, speaking in his room before a packed lunch break to refuel before heading out for his second round of the day, playing off a handicap of 10.
""Think of 41 Koreans golfing as you roam around the course, served by over 100 employees. It's like emperor's golfing,"" said Heo, kitted out in a hot pink golf shirt and shorts in a more subdued shade of pink. 
Heo said other countries should also adopt the Thai campaign and boost tourism by cutting days of confinement and allowing people to take walks or jog within a boundary.
""It's extremely hard to go golfing in Korea these days because of COVID,"" said Heo, due to spend another month in Thailand on business after completing quarantine. ""Here it's a golf paradise.""
The 2.49 million won ($2,240) price of the package - paid for by the golfers - is reasonable comparing with the cost of a 14-day isolation period spent cooped up in a regular hotel room, Ku Jung-keun, general manager of the Artitaya Country Club, told Reuters.
""The golf quarantine offers three safe (coronavirus) tests and time to enjoy golfing. Doctors provide daily health check-ups for the guests, too,"" said Ku.
The next group departs in two weeks, the golf club's Seoul operations director Hong Soon-bong says.
""We have around 100 rooms available for up to 150 people. We are receiving three times more inquiries (than in usual periods) about the package,"" Hong said.

""Since the COVID outbreak last February, our company reported little to no sales,"" he said. ""It was very difficult, but we came to hope again through this opportunity.""

1563,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 01:10AM ET</span>",Aboriginal Australian group encouraged but wary of South32's engagement,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - An Australian Aboriginal group said it was encouraged by the increased engagement taken by miner  South32  (OTC:SOUHY) over a new mine in Western Australia but remained cautious whether the miner will do more than the legal minimum.
Chief Executive Officer Graham (NYSE:GHM) Kerr said the miner had increased its interactions with the Noongar people over the development of its Hotham bauxite mine, which will produce the aluminium raw material at one of Western Australia's largest mining projects outside of iron ore.
""Certainly from our perspective, we are engaging with them extensively,"" he said during the company's earnings call last week.
Australian miners are under increasing pressure from investors and the public to improve their management of Indigenous sites beyond adhering to the current legal standards after Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) legally destroyed two ancient rockshelters at the Juukan Gorge site for an iron ore mine last year. 
This week, miners Fortescue and BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) both said they were investigating damage at heritage sites.
The industry's track record has many Indigenous groups wary.
""It is true that South32 have stepped up their efforts engaging with the Noongar people in recent times and there are some encouraging signs,"" Vanessa Kickett, Chairperson of the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council, which represents the Noongar, said in a statement.
""(But) it remains to be seen whether they will ultimately decide to do the bare minimum that is necessary to comply with their legal obligations, or whether they will instead choose to respect Noongar wishes,” she said.
On the earnings call, Kerr said South32 has reviewed how it manages its relationships with Indigenous partners after the Jukaan incident.
""In that space, we didn’t see ourselves having major gaps, but surely like all processes, we found an opportunity to improve,"" he said.
Part of the deposit lies on lands where there are river crossings that are culturally significant to the Noongar.
In a separate interview, Kerr said that it was important to keep a positive engagement with Noongar so they could see the benefits of the project.
""We are of the fundamental belief that we mine other people’s resources and if they don’t see a benefit... why would they want us there?"" he said.
Western Australia's heritage protection laws are being reformed, but for now skew in favour of approving mining projects with limited input from Indigenous groups.
And, while Kerr is optimistic around engagement, he noted that ""down the track if we have challenges or problems we will always look at what the legislative framework looks like"" including using a process to directly apply to the state for the mine's approval.

State media credit Xi's leadership with lifting nearly 100 million people from poverty, a milestone he declared in December and framed as a birthday gift for this year's 100th anniversary of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
In an hour-long speech, Xi hailed what he called a testament to the party's leadership and the advantages of China's political system. 
""The CCP's leadership and China's socialist system are the fundamental guarantees against risks, challenges and difficulties,"" Xi said in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, where he presented medals to key figures in the poverty fight. 
Some global policy experts have said China sets a low bar in its definition of poverty, with sustained investment required to fund continued development in its poorest areas.
China defines extreme rural poverty as annual per capita income of less than 4,000 yuan ($620), or about $1.69 a day at current exchange rates. That compares with the World Bank's global threshold of $1.90 a day.
Xi said China had invested 1.6 trillion yuan in fighting povery over the past eight years, but did not give figures for spending planned over the next five years.
In a ""No. 1 policy document"" released on Sunday, China vowed to stick with its poverty alleviation policies, while making some adjustments for a five-year transition towards what Beijing calls ""rural revitalisation"".

State media publicised the milestone, with a commentary of more than two pages in the party's main newspaper, the People's Daily, lauding the ""historic leap"" led by Xi.

1565,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 12:50AM ET</span>","U.S., allies respond to Iranian 'provocations' with studied calm","By Arshad Mohammed and John Irish
WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - In the week since Washington offered to talk with Tehran about reviving the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran has curbed U.N. monitoring, threatened to boost uranium enrichment and its suspected proxies have twice rocketed Iraqi bases with U.S. soldiers.
In return, the United States and three allies, Britain, France and Germany, have responded with a studied calm.
The response - or lack of one - reflects a desire not to disrupt the diplomatic overture in hopes Iran will return to the table and, if not, that the pressure of U.S. sanctions will keep taking its toll, U.S. and European officials said.
Iran has repeatedly demanded the United States first ease the U.S. sanctions imposed after former President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018. It would then wind down its own violations of the pact, which began a year after Trump's withdrawal.
""However much they believe the U.S. should lift sanctions first, that's not going to happen,"" said a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
If Iran wants the United States to resume compliance with the deal ""the best way and the only way is to get to the table where those things will be discussed,"" the official added.
Two European diplomats said they did not expect the United States, or Britain, France and Germany - informally known as the E3 - to do more to pressure Iran for now despite what one described as ""provocations.""
One of the diplomats said the current policy was to condemn but avoid doing anything that could close the diplomatic window.
""We have to tread carefully,"" said the diplomat. ""We have to see whether the E3 can juggle Iran's headlong rush and the U.S. hesitance to see whether we even have a path forward.""
The ""headlong rush"" was a reference to Iran's accelerating violations of the agreement.
In the last week, Iran has reduced cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, including by ending snap inspections of undeclared suspected nuclear sites.
A report by U.N. nuclear watchdog also said Iran has begun enriching uranium to 20%, above the 2015 deal's 3.67% limit, and Iran's supreme leader said Tehran could go to 60% if it wished, bringing it closer to the 90% purity needed for an atomic bomb.
The crux of the deal was that Iran would limit its uranium enrichment program to make it harder to amass the fissile material for a nuclear weapon - an ambition it has long denied - in return for relief from U.S. and other economic sanctions. 
While the United States says it is still investigating rockets fired at Iraqi bases last week that house U.S. personnel, they are suspected of having been carried out by Iranian proxy forces in a long-standing pattern of such attacks.
In a demonstration of the restrained U.S. stance, State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Monday that Washington was ""outraged"" by the attacks but would not ""lash out"" and would respond at a time and place of its choosing.
The second European diplomat said U.S. leverage was still in place because President Joe Biden had not lifted sanctions.
""Iran has positive signals from the Americans. It now needs to seize this opportunity,"" this diplomat said.
On Wednesday, spokesman Price told reporters the United States would not wait forever.

""Our patience is not unlimited,"" Price said.

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 11:20PM ET</span>",Explainer: What to expect from China's annual meeting of parliament,"By Gabriel Crossley
BEIJING (Reuters) - Thousands of delegates from across the country will gather in Beijing next week for the annual meeting of parliament, where China will announce goals for 2021 as well as its next five-year plan for economic development. 
Here's what to expect:
WHAT ARE THE 'TWO SESSIONS'?
The annual meetings of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's rubber-stamp parliament, and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), are known as the ""two sessions.""
The NPC is expected to sit for about a week, beginning on March 5. The CPPCC, a largely ceremonial advisory body, runs in parallel.
The events typically draw a combined 5,000 delegates and will be held under strict COVID-19 controls. Last year's meetings were delayed to May because of the coronavirus. 
Among the most-watched parts of the agenda are the presentation of an annual work report for 2021, and the release of China's 14th five-year plan, expected to include hundreds of pages spelling out priorities for the world's second-largest economy up to 2025.
Votes for new laws at the NPC follow the ruling Communist Party's wishes and generally pass by overwhelming majority, but delegates have sometimes departed from the party line to vent frustrations over issues such as corruption and crime.
All citizens older than 18 are technically allowed to be elected to the NPC via votes through lower-level bodies, but most delegates are hand-picked by local officials. 
Typically, Premier Li Keqiang and the government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, hold news conferences.
WHAT WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN THE WORK REPORT?
China usually announces its yearly GDP growth target, although last year it did not because of economic uncertainties caused by COVID-19. 
Policy sources have told Reuters there will again be no target this year, although analysts expect growth may top 8% amid a strong recovery from last year's coronavirus-induced slump.
Targets for inflation, job creation, the budget deficit and local government bond issuance for 2021 are expected.
China also typically includes a projection for growth in defence spending. Last year it was 6.6%, the lowest in three decades, although an improving domestic economy and rising tensions, including over Taiwan, are expected by many analysts to spur accelerated growth this year. 
The NPC is expected to consider changes to Hong Kong's electoral system to ensure only pro-Beijing ""patriots"" are governing. Last year, a month after hinting at national security legislation at the NPC, Beijing unveiled a tough national security law in response to months of anti-government protests in the city.
WHAT ABOUT THE 14TH FIVE-YEAR PLAN?
A draft of China's blueprint for economic and social development from 2021 to 2025 will also be made public, which analysts expect to be a vision of a greener, more innovative economy that is less dependent on the wider world. 
The document will set broad goals for growth, environmental protection, technological development, and living standards, to be fleshed out through more specific plans released later. 
An average annual growth target of about 5% for the entire period is likely to be set, Reuters previously reported, down from ""over 6.5%"" for the previous five years.
Encouraging innovation will probably be a key part of the plan, in part to reduce vulnerabilities in China's tech supply chains amid increasing tensions with the United States.
The government could also unveil reforms to spur domestic consumption and self-reliance under President Xi Jinping's ""dual circulation"" strategy. 

Another priority will be reducing emissions to move toward Xi's goal of making China carbon neutral by 2060. Demographic challenges brought about by China's rapidly aging population may also be addressed.

Police and troops were stationed at detention centers in the cities of Guayaquil, Cuenca and Latacunga, where gangs on Tuesday fought one another with handmade weapons in what authorities said was a coordinated outbreak of violence.
The gangs began a battle for leadership within the prison system in December when a leader of Los Choneros, considered the system's most powerful gang, was killed in a shopping center several months after being released.
Several of Tuesday's confrontations took place in maximum security areas of the Guayaquil and Cuenca prisons.
Prison authority SNAI said all those killed in the rioting were prisoners. A further dozen inmates and police were injured, according to official data.
""Thanks to the actions carried out between this institution and the National Police, the situation ... is under control,"" it added in a statement. 
Ecuador's prosecutor's office started an investigation into the violence, saying in a statement it had found 18 dismembered bodies in one of the prisons. 
Inmates' relatives remained outside the prisons on Wednesday hoping for information about their loved ones.
In a televised address, President Lenin Moreno acknowledged the prison system was overpopulated by around 30% and lacked sufficient funding and personnel.
The riots took place after authorities dismantled cocaine processing laboratories and seized 128 tons of drugs in 2020, a record for the Andean country, Moreno said.
""What happened yesterday is not causal, it was organized from outside the prisons and internally orchestrated by those who dispute leadership and drug trafficking throughout the national territory,"" Moreno said. ""What happened yesterday is not a coincidence, it is a consequence,"" he said, adding he would seek international help in the country's fight against organized crime. 

Moreno declared Ecuador's prison system in a state of emergency in 2019 after a wave of incidents that killed 24.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Scuffles broke out between rival protesters in the southern Mexican city of Iguala on Wednesday amid growing anger over President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's backing of a gubernatorial candidate accused of rape.
Video shared on social media showed one woman hitting another woman with a megaphone, bloodying her face, following a joint event between Lopez Obrador and Argentina's president, Alberto Fernandez.
The injured protester, Yolitzin Jaimes, was demonstrating against Felix Salgado, a gubernatorial candidate for the southern state of Guerrero and a member of Lopez Obrador's ruling MORENA party.
""We came here to protest peacefully, to ask the president to break the patriarchal pact,"" Jaimes told Reuters by telephone.
Calls have been growing in recent weeks for the president to drop his support for Salgado over the rape allegation. Earlier this month, a group of female MORENA lawmakers, party members and supporters published a letter urging the party leadership to reconsider Salgado's candidacy.
Lopez Obrador says the calls are politically motivated.

The Guerrero vote is part of a raft of elections taking place in June that will determine whether MORENA and its allies can retain control of the lower house of Congress.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said on Wednesday that allegations by U.S. prosecutors of his involvement with organized crime could affect cooperation with Washington in fighting drug trafficking.
U.S. prosecutors, in a federal court filing in New York on Feb. 5, said Hernandez used Honduran law enforcement https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-honduras-idUSKBN2A8291 and military officials to protect drug traffickers as part of a plan “to use drug trafficking to help assert power and control in Honduras.” 
U.S. prosecutors have said Hernandez accepted a million-dollar bribe https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-honduras-drugs-president-idUSKBN1WY03R from Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, who was convicted in 2019 and is serving a life sentence in a U.S. prison.
Hernandez has denied the allegations and he has not been charged with a crime. 
Hernandez, while speaking to the Honduran Congress on Wednesday, said that members of the ""Los Cahiros"" cartel falsely accused him in an effort to seek shorter prison sentences. He warned U.S. officials that believing these allegations could compromise joint security efforts between Washington and Tegucigalpa.
""If certain offices in the United States make the mistake of rewarding drug traffickers who give false testimony, instead of increasing their penalties ... then the battle that we have jointly waged with our allies against drug trafficking may become unsustainable because there will be loss of trust,"" Hernandez said.
He added that if Washington takes the accusations against him seriously, ""it will mean that sooner or later effective cooperation systems will inevitably collapse.""
Hernandez, who has been in power since 2014, is a close U.S. ally in Central America. Yet, the accusations against him pose a challenge for the Biden administration, which has promised to invest $4 billion into Central America to address the root causes of migration from the region.

Earlier this week, a group of Democratic senators introduced legislation to impose sanctions on Hernandez for corruption and human rights abuses and to suspend U.S. security assistance for the Honduran police and military.

In a sharply worded letter, Health Minister Kostadin Angelov said AstraZeneca's failure to comply with the agreed deliveries was compromising the massive vaccination campaign the Balkan country launched late last week.
The health ministry spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the letter, which was published on the website of Bulgaria's NOVA television on Wednesday. 
Dozens of Bulgarians have rushed to get a shot since Saturday, improving the country's record of inoculations, which was the worst in the European Union, but also quickly depleting the supplies of AstraZeneca doses.
AstraZeneca has told the EU it would cut vaccine deliveries to the 27-member bloc by 60% in the first quarter due to production problems. On Tuesday, an EU official told Reuters the company expected to deliver less than half of the doses it was contracted to supply to the bloc in the second quarter. 
Under an EU scheme, Bulgaria ordered 4.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine and arranged to receive them over 7 months, initially expecting to receive 450,000 doses in February, but has so far received only 117,000 shots.
Two deliveries for a total of 142,400 doses, confirmed on Feb. 15, were now being delayed to March 1 and reduced by about two-thirds, the letter said.
In the letter, Angelov demanded the immediate delivery of at least the 52,800 doses promised for March 1, saying that the Bulgarian government was ready to arrange air transport at its own expense as early as ""tomorrow"".
""I emphasise that failure to stick to the announced delivery schedule by AstraZeneca compromises the vaccination campaign in Bulgaria,"" Angelov wrote.

""With the lack of vaccines that were supposed to be delivered by your company the message that your company sends to the Bulgarian people would sound like this: 'AstraZeneca has taken the hope out of your hands',"" he said.

The West African country is one of the first in the region to start vaccinating its population against COVID-19. It has so far recorded 33,242 cases and 832 deaths from the disease. 
""We have seen how COVID manifests itself, and so it was with a smile that we can get vaccinated and at last achieve immunity,"" said Baye Moussa Samba, a doctor at a health centre in the Sicap neighbourhood, which was previously a COVID testing centre.
Senegal aims to inoculate about 90% of a targeted 3.5 million people, including health workers and high-risk individuals, by the end of 2021.
As a lower-middle income country, Senegal is eligible for about 1.3 million vaccine doses for free through the first wave of the World Health Organization's COVAX programme in early March.

The country is negotiating with Russian for more vaccines and is also eligible to get 3.4 million doses for just under $23 million under an African Union plan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday appeared reluctant to give police unlimited power to enter a home without a warrant when pursuing a suspect for a minor crime in a case involving a California driver tailed by an officer after honking his horn while listening to music.
The driver, Arthur Lange, was later convicted of driving under the influence after being confronted inside his garage by California highway patrol officer Aaron Weikert in 2016. Lange is seeking to overturn his conviction by arguing that sobriety test evidence in the case was obtained by Weikert in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable searches and seizures.
The nine justices heard arguments in the case and are due to rule by the end of June. A broad decision finding that any police pursuit, whatever the nature of the suspected offense, justifies a warrantless entry appears unlikely based on comments by the justices.
""It seems ridiculous when your home isn't your castle for terribly minor things,"" liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said.
Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts raised the example of teenagers fleeing back to their homes after being caught drinking beer in a park as an example of a situation in which warrantless entry would be inappropriate.
""It doesn't seem to be something that would warrant the officer, you know, breaking into the house,"" Roberts said.
After observing Lange driving and honking his horn, Weikert began following him and intended to stop him for violating local noise restrictions, a minor infraction that carries small fines, but did not immediately turn on the police vehicle's emergency lights, according to filings in the case.
Lange was already in his driveway when the officer caught up with him and activated his emergency lights. Weikert pulled into the driveway as Lange was driving his car into his garage. Lange later said he did not know the officer had been following him.
The garage door was just about to close when Weikert stuck his foot under the door, preventing it from shutting.
Weikert said he smelled alcohol and ordered Lange to take a sobriety test. Lange was found to be more than three times over the legal limit and was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) and a noise infraction. 
Lower courts ruled against Lange, deeming the incident a ""hot pursuit"" that allowed a warrantless entry. The justices potentially could rule that the incident was not a ""hot pursuit,"" meaning a warrant would have been needed.
Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas referred to it as a ""kind of meandering pursuit."" 
Such a ruling still could allow police to enter houses without warrants in certain circumstances even if the underlying crime was a misdemeanor.
Lange pleaded no contest to the DUI offense and was sentenced to 30 days in jail and three years of probation.
The California Court of Appeals in 2019 upheld Lange's conviction. Lange then asked the Supreme Court to rule that police officers cannot evade the warrant requirement when chasing someone to their home when the underlying conduct constitutes a misdemeanor offense. 
Under Supreme Court precedent, officers can enter a home without a warrant when they are in pursuit of a suspected felon.

The issue of police powers has been in the spotlight particularly during protests in many cities last year against police brutality and racism. A broad ruling in favor of police could further expand their powers by widening their ability to enter homes without a warrant after pursuing people suspected of misdemeanor offenses, not just felonies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock urged Gulf states to step up next Monday when the world body seeks to avert a large-scale ""man-made"" famine in Yemen by raising $3.85 billion for humanitarian operations in the war-torn Arabian Peninsula country for 2021. 
The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the people in need. Lowcock warned that if the world body does not receive the money it needs at a virtual pledging conference on Monday ""we're going to see is the worst famine the world has seen for decades."" 
In 2018 and 2019, the United Nations prevented famine in Yemen due to a well-funded aid appeal, which included large donations from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, Lowcock said. 
""What is alarming and what is different about the situation we're in now is that there's been such a big drop off in support for the aid operation that we've been cutting aid to starving people - not in an isolated way, in a way that affects millions of people all over the country,"" Lowcock said on Wednesday.
In 2020 the United Nations only received just over half the $3.4 billion it needed, which Lowcock said was largely due to smaller contributions from Gulf countries. He urged them to pledge generously for 2021 and pay quickly. 
""My message really to the Gulf countries ... is you have an extremely important role to play here, what you did in 2018 and 2019 saved a lot of lives, frankly, and enabled us to avoid a total collapse and a tragedy of genuinely historic proportion. It's now back on a knife edge,"" Lowcock told reporters. 
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-allied Houthi group. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as the country's suffering is also worsened by an economic and currency collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic.

""This is an entirely man-made famine,"" Lowcock said.

1579,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 03:02PM ET</span>",U.S. report on Khashoggi death expected to single out Saudi crown prince: sources,"By Mark Hosenball, Jonathan Landay and Trevor Hunnicutt
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration is expected to release a declassified U.S. intelligence report on Thursday finding that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, four officials familiar with the matter said.
The release would represent the latest move by U.S. President Joe Biden to realign ties with Riyadh after years in which Washington largely gave its key Arab ally and major oil producer a pass on its human rights record, intervention in Yemen’s civil war and other issues.
The report's release is expected to coincide with the first phone conversation, possibly on Wednesday, between Biden and Saudi King Salman since Biden took over the presidency.
Biden is shifting U.S. policy away from the cozy relationship that the White House of former president Donald Trump had with the crown prince. Biden is working to bring contact with Riyadh back along traditional lines after four years under Trump.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday Biden would only have communications with the 85-year-old Saudi king and said the declassified Khashoggi report was being readied for release and will come out soon. 
The 59-year old Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist, was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, and killed by a team of operatives linked to the crown prince, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. They then dismembered his body. His remains have never been found.
Riyadh eventually admitted that Khashoggi was killed in an “rogue” extradition operation gone wrong, but it denied any involvement by the crown prince. Five men given the death penalty for the murder had their sentences commuted to 20 years in jail after being forgiven by Khashoggi’s family.
Four U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the declassified U.S. intelligence report – to which the CIA was the main contributor - assessed that the crown prince approved and likely ordered the murder of Khashoggi, who had used his Washington Post column to criticize the crown prince’s policies.
A classified version of the report was briefed to Congress in late 2018.
But the Trump administration rejected demands by lawmakers and human rights groups to release a declassified version, seeking to preserve cooperation amid rising tensions with Riyadh’s regional rival, Iran, and promote U.S. arms sales to the kingdom.

Biden pledged during the 2020 presidential campaign to reassess U.S.-Saudi ties in part over Khashoggi’s murder. Since taking office, he has ended sales of offensive arms that Riyadh could use in Yemen and appointed a special envoy to boost diplomat efforts to end that country’s grueling civil war.

Israel has been importing Pfizer-BioNTech PFE.N, BNTX.O and Moderna Inc MRNA.O vaccines. It has administered at least one Pfizer dose to almost 50% of its 9 million population so far in one of the world's swiftest campaigns. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi)
On Sunday, Israel reopened many businesses, including street shops and malls though with some leisure facilities being open only to people immunised by vaccine or by having recovered from COVID-19. Many school children have returned to class but middle-school pupils are still home-learning, while restaurants are allowed to provide take-out and deliveries only. 
Speaking to reporters in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu said all eligible Israelis, 16 years of age and up, were expected to have been inoculated by the end of March, allowing a full reopening of the economy by April 5. 
Seeking re-election in a March 23 ballot, Netanyahu also said he was in talks with the heads of Pfizer and Moderna. ""We are going to establish two factories here that will make Israel part of the global vaccine supply chain,"" he said. 
Netanyahu said one would manufacture vials for Moderna and the other would be a research and development centre for Pfizer. There was no immediate comment from either company. 
On Tuesday Israel said it was giving small amounts of surplus COVID-19 vaccines to Palestinian-run territories as well as to several countries. 
This month the Palestinians received an initial shipment of Moderna doses from Israel, helping to kick off a limited vaccination programme in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. While Israel has been vaccinating Palestinians in East Jerusalem, it had come under foreign criticism for not extending its campaign to the other Palestinian areas.

(This story corrects to remove '5' from 5th paragraph to show Netanyahu said by April, not April 5.)

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - It was an event that could set a precedent in a world longing for a return to normal - a music concert attended by scores of Israelis vaccinated against COVID-19.
The open-air concert in Tel Aviv on Wednesday was one of the first in a programme to restart cultural events by restricting attendance to people who have been vaccinated or those with immunity after contracting the disease.
Attendees were required to show a ""Green Pass"", a government-validated certificate showing they had received both doses of the vaccine more than a week prior to the event or that they had recovered from COVID-19 and were presumed immune.
The passes are valid for six months from the time of full vaccination.
""It provides protection, but also a feeling of comfort to sit among people who are vaccinated,"" said Doron Zicher, a retired businessman who was preparing to watch Israeli singer Nurit Galron perform at dusk in Yarkon Park.
""After a year staying at home in a sort of isolated environment it feels great to go out and experience public shows and activities.""
Israel launched the pass scheme at the weekend as it reopened its economy. Nearly half of Israelis have received the first of two required doses.
Gyms, swimming pools, theatres and hotels are open to pass-holders only. Once inside, strict caps on occupancy and social distancing requirements are enforced.
Such programmes are likely to be scrutinised by other countries looking to reopen for business as their own populations undergo mass vaccination.
Health officials in Israel, which has led the world with its fast roll-out using the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, hope the scheme will act as an incentive for vaccine sceptics.
Israeli studies have shown the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccine reduces transmission of the virus.

""If I need to go to a cultural place where they don't ask for the green passport I wouldn't go,"" said Michal Porat, 66. ""I want to know and to be sure that all the people that are next to me are already immune and vaccinated, and I wouldn't trust people who are not.""

The British government is demanding concessions from the European Union to minimise disruption in trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom that have emerged since Britain left the bloc's trading orbit in January. 
The European Union has said it will be pragmatic in seeking solutions, but has blamed the disruption on Britain's decision to exit the European Union and has called for London to implement measures agreed.
Foster, who attended the online meeting between European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic and British minister Michael Gove, said there had been ""no breakthrough"".
""I can't say I am surprised given the attitude of the EU to the protocol,"" she told Northern Irish broadcaster UTV.
The Northern Ireland Protocol of Britain's EU withdrawal deal effectively left the British province of Northern Ireland within the EU's single market, and put a customs border in the Irish Sea dividing the province from mainland Britain.
Foster, who has supported the British demands for concessions, said Sefcovic refused a short extension of certain post-Brexit grace periods. She did not say what exactly Britain had asked for.
Foster said she wanted the protocol to be replaced at least in part. ""We are not asking for the impossible at all,"" she said. 
Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, a member of Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein who also attended the meeting, was more positive. 
""Both sides restated their commitment to finding practical solutions,"" she said in a statement.

""I encouraged intensified efforts to find practical solutions to any problems within the framework of the Protocol, which is part of a legal-binding treaty and not going away, something which all parties must recognise,"" she added.

The move comes months after the United States' Radio Free Europe, another post-war initiative designed to spread Western values to information-starved listeners behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War, also resumed Hungarian services.
""We are seeing that media diversity and press freedom are getting worse all the time in Hungary,"" said Peter Limbourg, DW's director general.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing government has been criticised by rights groups for keeping the media on a tight rein with a mixture of direct control, directed advertising spend, and regulation.
The country has fallen 33 spots in Reporters without Borders' Press Freedom ranking over the past seven years. This month, Klubradio, the last pro-opposition radio station, went off air after losing its broadcasting licence.
DW's move, reminiscent of the Cold War heyday of international broadcasting, when government-backed international stations from both sides of the Iron Curtain competed to spread their view of the world, has drawn fierce reaction.
""DW is deeply biased and has been fuelling irrational Orbanophobia for years. If that's what you call German 'public service' media, then we are deeply concerned about media pluralism in DE (Germany),"" government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said in an emailed response.
""Having the audacity to bring us otherwise deprived, unenlightened  Hungarians 'real stories' from Berlin, is another sad example of the left-liberal German media's embodiment of the dictatorship of opinion. The arrogance is breathtaking.""
Limbourg was nonplussed at Hungary's criticism of the decision, which was taken by the broadcaster's board, independently of the German government.
""I was surprised,"" he said. ""Reacting even before they'd seen what we'll produce. Reacting like that certainly doesn't suggest great self-assurance.""
DW has produced content for other EU countries, including Bulgaria, Poland and Romania for decades, but broadcasts to Hungary stopped in 2000, 11 years after the fall of communism in central and eastern Europe.
The BBC World Service and Radio France International also ended broadcasts to most of the region after the Cold War.

DW's offering will start small, with shows being uploaded to a dedicated Hungarian-language YouTube channel from the end of March. Limbourg said it had been allocated a budget in the ""mid six figures"" range.

ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi Christians are busy scrubbing churches, practising hymns and preparing for mass ahead of the first ever papal visit to the country, a four-day trip next month that is going ahead despite the coronavirus pandemic and security risks.
The minority community of several hundred thousand was decimated first by al Qaeda's rise in the early 2000s and later by Islamic State, the extremist group that brutally persecuted them and other minority faiths and sects from 2014-2017.
For many of those who remained, or have returned to Iraq where free worship is again possible, Pope Francis' visit from March 5-8 is welcome recognition of how they have suffered for their beliefs.
""We hope that after the pope's visit, the situation of Christians will improve,"" said Amer Abdelahad, a Christian in Erbil, as he registered to attend a mass for 10,000 people in the northern city on Sunday, March 7.
""Christians in Iraq suffered a lot over the past years, they are emigrating. The pope will come and see this reality on the ground,"" he added, accompanied by his wife and daughter who will also be at the gathering.
The trip by the 84-year-old leader of the world's Catholics was announced in December, and will take in the capital Baghdad, as well as Ur, a city linked to the Old Testament figure of Abraham, and Erbil, Mosul and Qaraqosh in the plain of Nineveh.
A twin suicide attack in Baghdad killed at least 32 people in January, a reminder of Iraq's ongoing security risks despite the defeat of Islamic State and a general reduction in militant violence. The pope condemned the bombing.
Although some of Iraq's Christians, who include Catholics and Orthodox, have moved back to homes they fled during the upheaval of the last two decades, others foresee further problems and are looking to leave.
UNIQUE MASS
Father Dankha Joola, one of the main organisers of the visit to Erbil, said that more than 8,000 people had registered for the mass already.
His biggest challenge is to implement social distancing at the outdoor stadium where the pope will lead the service. The venue has a capacity of around 30,000, but numbers are limited to one third of that due to COVID-19 restrictions.
Daniella Rafiq is one of more than 200 volunteers lending him a hand. For her, the visit is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see the pope.
""Over the last few years, whenever there was a meeting with the pope in different countries, especially with young people, we were deprived,"" she said, referring to difficulties she and other Iraqis faced in obtaining visas to travel in the past.
Father Naswhan Cola, who is organising the religious service, said it would be unique, with prayers in Italian and an orchestra and choir of about 80 local volunteers performing hymns in Arabic and Syriac, the neo-Aramaic language spoken by Christians in northern Iraq.
Before the mass in Erbil, Pope Francis will visit the city of Mosul and the nearby town of Qaraqosh, both under Islamic State occupation for three years.
Mosul's once thriving Christian community is today reduced to no more than 70 families, while in Qaraqosh a relatively large number have returned, partly thanks to the church's role in leading reconstruction efforts and mobilising Christians.
Dozens of volunteers were proud at the prospect of receiving the pope in the Grand Immaculate Church, Iraq's biggest, which doubled as a shooting range for Islamic State fighters before being ravaged by fire.
Some wiped the stone floor, stopping only to dance to Christian songs that resonated through the cavernous grey-stone edifice, still virtually empty since it was restored.

""The pope's visit is not only for Iraq's Christians, but for the whole country,"" said Father Francis, who was helping put up posters of the pope around the streets of Qaraqosh.

GENEVA (Reuters) - China hit back on Wednesday at growing criticism by Western powers of its treatment of ethnic minorities in the regions of Xinjiang and Tibet and of citizens in the former British colony of Hong Kong.
Hours earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in a wide-ranging speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council, said that the Biden administration would denounce atrocities in Xinjiang.
""At this high-level segment, the U.K., EU, Germany, USA, Canada, and some other countries abused this forum of the Council to make groundless charges against China, to interfere in internal affairs of our country. We firmly oppose and categorically reject these attempts,"" Chen Xu, China's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told the forum.
Britain's foreign minister Dominic Raab kicked off the Western rebukes on Monday, denouncing torture, forced labour and sterilisations that he said were taking place against Muslim Uighurs on an ""industrial scale"" in Xinjiang.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called on China on Tuesday to allow U.N. human rights boss Michelle Bachelet to visit and investigate alleged mistreatment of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang and of people in Tibet.
""Ignoring reality, the above-mentioned countries fabricate and spread lies about Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong,"" Chen said.
CAMPS
Activists and U.N. rights experts have said that at least one million Muslims are detained in camps in the remote western region of Xinjiang. China denies abuses and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.
Chen suggested that Western powers should work to improve their own records, singling out for criticism overseas military interventions which resulted in ""repeated killing of innocent people"".

""They should resolve their own human rights problems such as deep-rooted racial discrimination, gaps between rich and poor, social inequity, injustice, police brutality,"" he added.

The camp, across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas, is home to hundreds of migrants, most from Central America, hoping to be granted refuge across the border. They have endured sub-zero temperatures over the last week while living in flimsy tents.
""The migrant camp in Matamoros has recently been hard hit by extreme weather in northern Mexico. As President Biden continues to rebuild the nation's border management in a way that reflects America's values, addressing humanitarian needs in Matamoros has become a priority,"" the department said in a statement. 
It said new arrivals at the camp will not gain entry into the United States through this limited process.
The statement came after DHS abruptly canceled plans last Monday to bring asylum seekers into Texas at two ports of entry.
Some camp residents have lived there for more than a year under former President Donald Trump's controversial Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for U.S. court hearings.
The Biden administration has said a new process will gradually begin to allow thousands of MPP asylum seekers to await courts’ decisions within the United States.
U.N. agencies will begin preparing camp residents for possible entry on Wednesday, conducing in-person registration of Matamoros' estimated 750 residents, the U.N. Refugee Agency said in a statement. An initial group could be allowed to enter the United States this week, pending approval by U.S. authorities, it said.
There will be strict enforcement of health and safety protocols including testing for COVID-19, DHS said. 
Its statement also contained a warning, as the Biden administration tries to head off a surge of migrants flocking to the border after a crackdown on immigration under Trump.

""Individuals should not believe smugglers or others claiming the border is now open. The administration will enforce existing immigration laws,"" it said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A Thai court on Wednesday sentenced 14 political leaders to jail, including three incumbent cabinet ministers, after finding them guilty of insurrection during anti-government protests that culminated in a 2014 military coup.
The court found 26 of 39 defendants guilty, a lawyer for the group said, for actions that included obstructing elections and invading government property, which took place during seven months of demonstrations against the government of Yingluck Shinawatra. 
Digital Minister Puttipong Punnakanta, Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan and Deputy Transport Minister Thaworn Senneam received jail terms ranging from five years to seven years and four months. According to the country's constitution, they will be required to vacate their posts. 
A government spokesman declined to give comment on jailed ministers, while the court could not be reached. 
The ministers are all in the cabinet of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led a coup that overthrew Yingluck in 2014, an intervention the military said was necessary to prevent bloodshed as protests against her intensified. 
""They pleaded not guilty to all the charges and will appeal,"" said Sawat Charoenpon, a lawyer representing the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), as the group is known.
PDRC leader and former deputy prime minister Suthep Thaugsuban was jailed for five years. Of those found guilty, 12 were given suspended sentences and six were released on bail. 
""We the leaders of the PDRC have been convicted to many years in jail yet all of us still maintain our ideals of serving the nation, religion and king,"" Suthep posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after the verdict.
The PDRC protests in 2013 and 2014 play a pivotal role in uniting royalist and nationalist forces against a government they said was controlled by fugitive tycoon and ousted former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, Yingluck's exiled brother. Both Shinawatras won elections by landslides. 
Prayuth stayed on as prime minister after the coup and retained the post after a 2019 election, which he insists was free and fair, despite opposition allegations of foul play.

The former general endured months of street protests himself last year by a youth-led movement demanding his resignation, a new constitution and reforms to the monarchy.

Amnesty, however, still believes that Navalny should be freed from jail, that he has committed no crime and that he is being persecuted for his campaigning and outspoken criticism of President Vladimir Putin and his government, it said. 
The 44-year-old Russian opposition politician was flown to Germany last August to recover from a near-fatal poisoning in Siberia with what many Western nations said was a nerve agent. 
He was arrested on his return to Russia last month and sentenced to jail for parole violations he called trumped up. He is set to spend just over two-and-a-half years behind bars. The West has demanded his release; Russia says that is meddling. 
""Amnesty International took an internal decision to stop referring to ... Navalny as a prisoner of conscience in relation to comments he made in the past,"" the group said in a statement sent to Reuters on Wednesday. 
""Some of these comments, which Navalny has not publicly denounced, reach the threshold of advocacy of hatred, and this is at odds with Amnesty's definition of a prisoner of conscience,"" it added. 
Amnesty, which had named Navalny a ""prisoner of conscience"" on Jan. 17 after his arrest, did not specify which comments it was referring to and said it was not aware of similar pronouncements made by him in recent years. 
Navalny, who has carved out a following campaigning against official corruption, has been criticised for past nationalist statements against illegal immigration and for attending an annual nationalist march several years ago. 
In a 2007 video, he called for the deportation of migrants to prevent the rise of far-right violence. ""We have a right to be (ethnic) Russians in Russia. And we'll defend that right,"" he said in the video. 
Navalny could not be reached for comment as he was in jail. His allies protested the move by Amnesty on Twitter. 
Alexander Golovach, a lawyer for Navalny's FBK anticorruption group, said he was renouncing an earlier ""prisoner of conscience"" status that Amnesty gave him in 2018 to protest.

Ivan Zhdanov, a Navalny ally, said: ""the procedure for assigning and revoking Amnesty International status has proven extremely shameful.""

The infection rate in Germany fell steadily in the first weeks of the year but has stagnated in recent days, making it more difficult for leaders to ease restrictions when they meet next week to consider lockdown rules that run to March 7.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has told lawmakers in her conservative party that making rapid tests more available and boosting testing capacity could make a return to normality more durable, two sources at the meeting told Reuters on Tuesday.
The government expects such tests will cost it up to 810 million euros ($985 million) a month for 30 million to 45 million tests, according to documents obtained by Reuters.
The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, Germany's pharmaceutical regulator, on Wednesday approved antigen tests made by Healgen Scientific, Xiamen Boson Biotech and Hangzhou Laihe Biotech for use by people who are not medical professionals, according to its website.
Spahn told broadcaster ZDF earlier that further home test kits would be approved next week.
Other countries are also banking on home tests to help limit the spread of the virus. In Austria, self-tests are already being used in schools, and they will be available to the public for free at pharmacies from next week.
In England, volunteers and police have handed out COVID-19 testing kits to try to halt the spread of a highly infectious variant that originated in South Africa.
In Germany, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose by 8,007 to 2,402,818, an increase of 451 compared with a week ago. The infection rate rose to 59.3 cases per 100,000 people over the past seven days, from 57 a week earlier.

KOBLENZ, Germany (Reuters) - A German court sentenced a former member of President Bashar al-Assad's security services to 4-1/2 years in prison on Wednesday for facilitating the torture of civilians, the first such verdict for crimes against humanity in the 10-year-old Syrian civil war.
The higher regional court in the western city of Koblenz said Eyad A. had arrested at least 30 anti-government protesters at the start of the conflict in 2011 and sent them to an intelligence facility where he knew detainees were tortured.
The verdict gives hope to the 800,000 Syrians in Germany who say they were tortured in government facilities after attempts to establish an international tribunal for Syria failed.
""This is an important step forward in the process of securing accountability for the Syrian government's systematic use of torture against civilians,"" said Steve Kostas, a lawyer with the Open Society Foundation's Justice Initiative, which is representing Syrian plaintiffs.
The Assad government denies it tortures prisoners. 
Eyad A.'s lawyers had asked for an acquittal, saying he had carried out the arrests in and around Damascus under duress by his superiors. He had asked the court to consider him a witness in broader legal efforts against the Syrian government.
The same court will continue hearings in the case of a second suspect identified as Anwar R., a former intelligence officer charged with 58 murders in a Damascus prison where prosecutors say at least 4,000 opposition activists were tortured in 2011 and 2012.
Syrian human rights lawyer Anwar al-Bunni said the unprecedented verdict would speed up efforts to bring charges against former members of the Syrian government suspected of war crimes who have fled to Europe.

""History has been made,"" said al-Bunni. ""The first verdict against a member of the Syrian regime's torture and murder machine is a verdict against the whole regime, not just against one individual. It gives hope that justice is possible.""

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 06:01AM ET</span>",Neighbours' efforts to help end Myanmar crisis raise suspicion among protesters,"(Reuters) - Myanmar's military-appointed foreign minister flew into Thailand on Wednesday for talks with two of his neighbours as they intensified efforts to resolve a crisis over Myanmar's coup, despite the scepticism of its pro-democracy camp.
The minister, Wunna Maung Lwin, made the first foreign trip by a member of the new military government as opponents of the Feb. 1 coup again took to the streets in Myanmar. 
The army seized power after alleging fraud in a Nov. 8 election swept by Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), detaining her and much of the party leadership. The electoral commission dismissed the fraud complaints. 
Indonesia has taken the lead within the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in efforts to steer a path out of the crisis and its foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, arrived in Bangkok on Wednesday and met Wunna Maung Lwin and Thai Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai.
A Thai source said the Myanmar minister also had a meeting scheduled with Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.
The Indonesian effort has raised suspicion among Myanmar activists who fear dealing with the junta would confer legitimacy on it and its bid to scrap the November election. They insist the result should stand.
Dozens of protesters gathered outside the Thai embassy in the main city of Yangon with signs reading: ""Respect our vote"" and ""We voted NLD"".
""Our foreign minister is Aung San Suu Kyi,"" the protesters chanted, referring to the post she held in the government she led after winning a 2015 election in a landslide.
In Bangkok, Thai prime minister Prayuth, a former army chief who seized power in a 2014 coup, declined to confirm to reporters he had met the Myanmar minister.
""Some things are not official,"" he said. ""We offer support as an ASEAN country that has to cooperate and offer well-wishes that everything works out smoothly.""
This week has seen huge rallies and a general strike to denounce the coup and demand Suu Kyi's release despite a warning from authorities that confrontation could get people killed.
A Reuters report this week fanned suspicion about Indonesia's approach after it cited sources as saying Indonesia was proposing that ASEAN members send monitors to ensure the generals stick to their promise of fair, new elections.
The military has not given a time frame for a new election but it imposed a one-year state of emergency when it seized power so it would likely be after that.
An Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman later said it was not backing a new election. The Indonesian foreign minister had been expected to fly to Myanmar on Wednesday but the plan was dropped, her ministry said.
""This is not the ideal time to conduct a visit,"" ministry spokesman Teuku Faizasyah told a briefing in Jakarta. 
WORRY OVER VIOLENCE
The Myanmar-based Future Nation Alliance activist group, said earlier in a statement a visit by Retno would be “tantamount to recognising the military junta”. 
The group demanded foreign officials meet Htin Lin Aung, a member of a committee representing ousted members of parliament appointed the “sole responsible official for foreign relations”.
Protesters in the second city of Mandalay marched on Wednesday in support of the ousted parliamentarians.
A procession of elephants also marched in Mandalay.
As well as the political crisis, the coup is compounding Myanmar's economic woes.
Military chief General Min Aung Hlaing has called for state spending and imports to be cut and exports increased to revive what he called an ailing economy.
He did not link the protests to economic problems but said the authorities were following a democratic path in dealing with them and police were using minimal force, such as rubber bullets, state media reported.
Security forces have shown more restraint compared with earlier crackdowns against people who had pushed for democracy during almost half a century of direct military rule. 
Even so, three protesters have been shot and killed. The army has said one policeman was killed.
The crisis has restored Myanmar's reputation as the problem member of the 10-country ASEAN and the diplomatic scramble by its neighbours comes as wider international concern is growing.
China has traditionally taken a softer line as have ASEAN neighbours.
But the Group of Seven (G7) rich nations on Tuesday condemned intimidation and oppression of those opposing the coup.

The United States imposed sanctions on two more members of the junta and warned it could take more action, while the European Union has said it was considering sanctions that would target businesses owned by the army.

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. President Joseph Biden's new administration said on Wednesday it would continue its international re-engagement by seeking election to the U.N. Human Rights Council where it will press to eliminate a ""disproportionate focus"" on ally Israel.
Under former President Donald Trump's more isolationist approach, Washington quit the council in 2018 but the Biden government has already returned as an observer.
""I'm pleased to announce the United States will seek election to the Human Rights Council for the 2022-24 term,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the council by video.
""We humbly ask for the support of all U.N. member states in our bid to return to a seat in this body.""
Elections for three-year membership on the 47-member council are due at the U.N. General Assembly in October. 
Britain, China and Russia are among members, as are the Philippines and Venezuela who are under formal scrutiny by the Council. ""Those with the worst human rights records should not be members of this Council,"" Blinken added.
'CALL OUT ABUSES'
The council, set up in 2006, has a stand-alone item on the Palestinian territories on its agenda every session - the only issue with such treatment - which both Democratic and Republican administrations have opposed.
It routinely adopts resolutions condemning alleged violations by Israel in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
""As the United States re-engages, we urge the Human Rights Council to look at how it conducts its business. That includes its disproportionate focus on Israel,"" Blinken said.
""We will continue to call out abuses in places like Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Iran,"" he added.
Blinken reiterated the U.S. call on Russia to release opposition figure Alexei Navalny as well as hundreds of others detained during protests. 

He said Washington would denounce atrocities in Xinjiang, China's western region where activists and U.N. experts say 1 million Muslim Uighurs are held in camps. And he acknowledged rights issues at home, saying the United States would work to combat both systemic racism and economic injustice.

1593,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 05:35AM ET</span>",Russia increases fines for protest violations after Navalny rallies,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin approved legislation on Wednesday beefing up fines for offences committed during street protests after thousands were detained at unsanctioned rallies in support of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
The legislation increases fines for insubordination to law enforcement officers to up to 4,000 roubles ($54.30) from 1,000 roubles in addition to a maximum of 15 days in detention. 
The amended law also introduces fines of up to 20,000 roubles for protest organisers who violate funding regulations. 
Police detained more than 11,000 people at nationwide protests this year in support of Navalny, according to OVD-Info, a protest monitoring group.
The Interior Ministry had warned in advance that it would break up unauthorised rallies and that those taking part could be prosecuted. 
Navalny's allies - most of whom are now abroad or under house arrest - have declared a moratorium on street protests until the spring. 
Navalny, 44, was flown to Germany for treatment last August after collapsing in Russia following what he said was an attempt to kill him. Germany said he was poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent, an assertion backed by many Western countries but questioned by the Kremlin, which denies any involvement in the incident.
Navalny was detained on his return to Russia last month and sentenced to jail on Feb. 2 for parole violations on what he said were trumped-up charges. He is set to spend just over two-and-a-half years behind bars. 
Russia has ignored a demand by the European Court of Human Rights to release Navalny, and European Union foreign ministers agreed on Monday to impose sanctions on four senior Russian officials close to Putin in a mainly symbolic response to Navalny's jailing.

The EU is expected to formally approve the agreement in early March.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",Malaysia's king says parliament can convene during emergency,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's King Al-Sultan Abdullah said on Wednesday parliament can convene during a state of emergency, a move that could open the door for the opposition to launch a fresh confidence vote to challenge Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin.
Last month, the king declared a nationwide state of emergency that could last till Aug. 1, as Malaysia struggled to control a jump in coronavirus cases after managing to contain infections for most of last year.
But the opposition accused Muhyiddin of using the emergency to retain control during a power struggle, especially after it appeared he may have lost his majority when two government lawmakers said they no longer backed him.
In a statement, the national palace said that the king was of the view that parliament can convene on a date that he deems suitable and taking into consideration the premier's advice.
The emergency ordinance, which supercedes regular laws when in force, requires that parliament be convened, prorogued or dissolved on a date decided by the king and on the advice of the prime minister, the palace said.
""Hence, the view by certain parties that the emergency proclamation stops parliament from convening is not accurate,"" the statement read.
The prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Muhyiddin's 11 months in office have been beset by infighting in his ruling coalition and a leadership challenge from opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, just as the country grappled with the economic and health crises caused by the pandemic.
Should parliament be allowed to convene, the opposition could seek another confidence vote and if Muhyiddin lost he would either have to resign or seek the king's assent to dissolve parliament, paving the way for an election.
The palace said the king agreed to Muhyiddin's request for an emergency declaration last month only as a ""proactive measure"" to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Malaysia had reported nearly 290,000 coronavirus infections and 1,076 deaths as of Tuesday, the third-highest number of cases in the region behind Indonesia and the Philippines.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",Malaysia urged to explain deportation of Myanmar detainees despite court order,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Several lawmakers and rights groups on Wednesday called on Malaysia's government to explain its deportation of more than 1,000 Myanmar nationals, despite a court-ordered stay, with some saying the move could amount to contempt of court. 
The Kuala Lumpur High Court on Tuesday had granted a stay on the deportation of 1,200 Myanmar citizens held in immigration detention centres, pending an application by Amnesty International and Asylum Access to suspend the plan amid fears over their safety.
But hours after the ruling, Malaysia's top immigration official said authorities had repatriated 1,086 Myanmar citizens on three Myanmar navy ships.
""We believe that the government owes an explanation to the people of Malaysia as to why they chose to defy the court order,"" Amnesty's Malaysia director Katrina Maliamauv told reporters.
The prime minister's office and Immigration Department Director-General Khairul Dzaimee Daud did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The court on Wednesday fixed March 9 to rule on whether the groups would be allowed to challenge the deportation, said New Sin Yew, a lawyer for the rights groups.
It also extended the stay order barring the remaining 114 detainees from being deported before the next hearing.
In a separate statement, four opposition lawmakers questioned whether the deportation amounted to contempt of court and told authorities to provide more details of those deported.
Khairul had said those repatriated did not include Rohingya refugees or asylum-seekers.
But concerns over the deportation of unregistered asylum-seekers have persisted, as the U.N. refugee agency has not been allowed to interview detainees for more than a year to verify their status. 
The rights groups in their court filing said three U.N.-registered people and 17 minors with at least one parent in Malaysia were on the deportee list. It was unclear if those were sent back. 

Malaysia is home to more than 154,000 asylum-seekers from Myanmar, where the military seized power this month.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal's embattled Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli will not resign but face a floor test in parliament instead, an aide said on Wednesday, a day after the Supreme Court rejected his decision to dissolve the legislature and call early elections.
Political turmoil has rocked the Himalayan nation since last December, when Oli suddenly dissolved parliament and announced the elections, blaming ruling party leaders for a lack of co-operation on key matters of policy. 
Oli, 69, has started meeting some allies in the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to review the situation after the court ruled that parliament's abrupt dissolution was unconstitutional and ordered that it be called into session before March 8.
Thousands of Nepalis opposed to Oli took to the streets in the capital, Kathmandu, for a public rally on Wednesday to celebrate the decision and press fresh demands for the prime minister to resign. 
""The prime minister will not resign now. There is no question about that,"" Surya Thapa, the aide, told Reuters.
""He will face parliament,"" Thapa added, but did not elaborate. 
Members of the anti-Oli faction said they rejected his autocratic style of functioning and the latest court order proved his inability to govern.
All lawmakers opposed to the prime minister are engaged in talks over their next move, said Narayan Kaji Shrestha, a senior NCP leader who organised countrywide protests against Oli in the past months. 

""If Oli does not resign then parliament will take a decision on his political fate,"" Shrestha said, adding that the tourism-dependent economy battered by the coronavirus needs a stable government.

In New South Wales (NSW), 30 people will be allowed to dance at weddings and as many as 30 people will be able to sing indoors together, up from five currently. Households will also be allowed to host 50 guests, up from 30.
The move comes after the state, which accounts for a third of Australia's population of 25 million, logged no locally acquired infections for a 38th straight day on Wednesday and as the country entered its third day of a nationwide vaccination programme.
""With the rollout of the vaccine now underway and no new locally acquired cases in NSW, we are able to make further changes towards a new COVID normal,"" state Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters.
Restrictions are also being eased in South Australia from Friday. Dancing will be now allowed at smaller venues with capacity of less than 200 people, while at bigger venues, 50 can dance at a time at a designated area. The state will also drop testing requirements for visitors from Melbourne, which had previously been a COVID-19 hotspot.
Although there have been cases among returning citizens from abroad, Australia has largely contained community transmission of the virus with speedy contact tracing, mandatory mask-wearing on public transport and snap lockdowns.
It has recorded just under 29,000 COVID-19 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began.
The nationwide immunisation drive has seen some incorrect dosages after two elderly people were inadvertently given four times the recommended dose of the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) COVID-19 vaccine.

""Both patients are being monitored and both are showing no signs at all of an adverse reaction but it is a reminder of the importance of the safeguards,"" Health Minister Greg Hunt told reporters in Canberra.

BHP discovered the damage to the site of significance to the Banjima people on Jan. 29, as part of monitoring at its Mining Area C operations. It informed its Banjima partners and the groups agreed to set up a probe into the incident, BHP President Minerals Australia, Edgar Basto said in a statement. 
“This site is not part of current mining operations. The cause of this rock fall is not known,"" Basto said in a statement late on Tuesday.
Mining Area C is part of BHP's $3.4 billion South Flank replacement project in the state's Pilbara region. 
Miners are facing closer scrutiny over what they do to protect sacred Indigenous sites in the wake of Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO)'s destruction of two ancient, sacred rock shelters at Juukan Gorge last May. The mining company had obtained a permit to destroy the sites.  
Basto and Brandon Craig, head of BHP's Western Australian iron ore operations, met with Banjima Elders as part of the Banjima Heritage Advisory Council that BHP set up last year following the Juukan Gorge incident. 
""We will continue to work with the Banjima in a spirit of respect and cooperation,” BHP said.

Ignacio Mier, the majority leader of Mexico's lower house of Congress, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that lawmakers received the request for Francisco Garcia Cabeza de Vaca's immunity to be removed, posting a copy of a letter along with his tweet.
Federal sources confirmed the authenticity of the letter to Reuters. 
Tamaulipas is widely considered one of the most lawless areas of Mexico, where the line between the authorities and organized crime sometimes blurs. This month, officials arrested a dozen elite Tamaulipas state officers for alleged involvement in a massacre that left 19 people, mostly migrants, dead, with many of the bodies badly charred.
Two of the state's previous three governors are now under arrest.
Governor Garcia said he had not been notified of the accusations, describing them as politically motivated.

New data released by the UN's World Food Program (WFP) showed nearly 8 million people across the four countries are experiencing hunger this year, up from 2.2 million in 2018.
""The COVID-19-induced economic crisis had already put food on the market shelves out of reach for the most vulnerable people when the twin hurricanes Eta and Iota battered them further,"" Miguel Barreto, WFP Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean, said in a statement.

The storms that destroyed their home were the latest blow pushing the family further into hunger, Rosado said, after pandemic-related restrictions limited their ability to collect bottles and cans in the streets to sell to recycling companies.
Hunger is particularly bad in the ""Dry Corridor"" that runs through Central America, where climate change has exacerbated drought in recent years.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Each morning before work at a Singapore construction site, Gunasekar Udayakumar, 41, gets his vital signs checked, without going to a clinic, or even seeing a nurse. 
All he needs is his smartphone, which in just 45 seconds can tell him his heart rate, oxygen levels and even his stress levels.
It can also tell him if he should see a doctor. 
    The application, developed by Singapore startup Nervotec, is what construction firm Kajima considers its first line of defence against another outbreak of the coronavirus in Singapore. 
The city-state has kept a tight lid on its infections and wants to avoid a repeat of last year, when a series of clusters emerged in migrant worker dormitories. 
Kajima staff at various sites have used the application since December as part of a government-initiated programme that provides companies with trial-stage technology to help them adjust to the new pandemic-era norms.
It offers a diagnosis of the user's health condition, relying solely on a smartphone camera that can measure heart rate by picking up changes in the reflectivity of light on the user's skin between heart beats according to blood flow underneath.
Nervotec founder Jonathan Lau said Singapore's government was very interested in the technology. 
""We see the most traction coming from healthcare providers, both private and public,"" he said. 
Lau's initial inspiration came from his experiences as an air force pilot, when he underwent constant check-ups. 
He eventually founded a company that used wearable devices to monitor pilots. But when the pandemic hit, Lau broadened the focus. 
    The app is still undergoing local review and Chwee Teck Lim, director of the National University of Singapore's Institute of Health Innovation and Technology, said it could have a big impact if approved by regulators

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and an alliance of faith groups urged President Joe Biden on Tuesday to back a big boost in the International Monetary Fund's emergency reserve funds to help poor countries devastated by the coronavirus pandemic.
In a letter to Biden, the governing body of the church said the United States should take urgent action to help the poorest countries on humanitarian grounds, but also to shore up its own economic interests and bolster trade with the developing world.
""The U.S. government is vital to ensuring the world emerges from this pandemic with greater resilience,"" the groups wrote, citing a World Bank estimate that the pandemic would push as many as 150 million people into extreme poverty this year.
Biden is only the second Roman Catholic to be elected U.S. president, but his support for reproductive rights has led to strained ties with the conservative conference of bishops.
In the letter, the bishops and Jubilee USA Network said the Biden administration should ""lead the world"" in a new issuance of the IMF's own currency, or Special Drawing Rights, just as it did during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.
The Biden administration has not said whether it will reverse the Trump administration's position blocking a new issuance. U.S. support is critical for any boost in reserves since it is the IMF's largest shareholder.
Italy, current head of the Group of 20 major economies, says it is renewing its push for a $500 billion issuance - a move akin to a central bank printing money.
The bishops and Jubilee said they welcomed emerging consensus around $500 billion in new SDRs, but a bigger package was needed to address the huge financial needs triggered by the pandemic and years of escalating debts in poor countries.
They urged Biden to work with Congress and the IMF to issue SDRs worth $3 trillion, of which $1 trillion would be available to developing countries. Democrats have introduced legislation in Congress backing the bigger amount.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 06:40PM ET</span>",Beat poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti dies at age 101,"By Bill Trott
(Reuters) - Poet and publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti, whose City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco became a West Coast literary haven for Beat Generation writers like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, has died at the age of 101, City Lights said on Tuesday. 
Ferlinghetti, who played a key role in a free-speech battle after he published Ginsberg's poem ""Howl"" in 1956, passed away on Monday evening, said City Lights Books on Twitter, adding ""We love you, Lawrence.""
When Ferlinghetti turned 100 on March 24, 2019, San Francisco officials declared it Lawrence Ferlinghetti Day. City Lights threw a party, although the honoree did not attend due to failing eyesight and trouble in getting around.
The publishing house Doubleday released Ferlinghetti's ""Little Boy,"" an experimental novel with autobiographical touches told in a stream-of-consciousness style, in conjunction with his 100th birthday.
The Beat Generation first percolated in New York in the 1950s but Kerouac, Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs and a slew of other writers, artists, hipsters, activists and thrill-seekers would eventually wander West to 261 Columbus Avenue in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood to hang out at City Lights.
""I keep telling people I wasn't a member of the original Beat Generation,"" Ferlinghetti told the Los Angeles Times in 2005. ""I was sort of the guy tending the store."" 
In 1957 Ferlinghetti, a former Eagle Scout, found himself on the front line of a constitutional fight when he was arrested after publishing and selling Ginsberg's ground-breaking ""Howl and Other Poems."" While it was considered an epic achievement by Beat peers, ""Howl"" shocked much of America with its references to drugs and homosexuality and renunciation of mainstream society.
Ferlinghetti was cleared of obscenity charges when a judge ruled ""Howl"" was not obscene because it had redeeming social value.
""It put us on the map, courtesy of the San Francisco Police Department,"" Ferlinghetti said. ""It's hard to get that kind of publicity.""
Ferlinghetti and Peter D. Martin, a sociology student at the time, had founded City Lights as a bookstore and small publisher in 1953, naming it for Charlie Chaplin's 1931 movie. In a few years it became a Bohemian mecca for intellectuals, writers, dissidents, activists, musicians and artists.
""City Lights became about the only place around where you could go in, sit down and read books without being pestered to buy something,"" Ferlinghetti said in a 2006 Hartford Courant interview. ""... Also, I had this idea that a bookstore should be a center of intellectual activity.""
Ferlinghetti's works often showed an anti-establishment or political bent. He wanted his poems to be accessible to all.
""The poem should have a public surface, by which I mean anybody who hasn't had any education could still understand the poem,"" he told Writer's Digest in a 2010 interview. ""Then below that it should have a subjective or subversive level, which would make the poem more important than just a surface lyric that's just giving you a nice picture.""
In his biography, ""Lawrence Ferlinghetti: Poet at Large,"" Larry Smith wrote that his subject's writing ""sings with the sad and comic music of the streets.""
The most successful of Ferlinghetti's many works was the 1958 poetry collection ""A Coney Island of the Mind,"" which sold more than 1 million copies. Described by the New York Times as ""among the most popular poets of the modern era,"" he published poetry through 2012 and in 2015 put out ""Writing Across the Landscape: Travel Journals,"" a collection of his writings spanning more than 50 years.
In 2017 a collection titled ""Ferlinghetti's Greatest Poems"" was released.
Ferlinghetti was born in Yonkers, New York, a few months after his father died. His mother suffered from mental illness so he went to live with a relative in France and later with another family in New York.
He earned a journalism degree at the University of North Carolina, served in the Navy during World War Two, serving on a submarine-chasing ship during the D-Day invasion, and received a doctorate in literature from the Sorbonne.
During his Navy service, Ferlinghetti toured Nagasaki six weeks after it was hit with a U.S. atomic bomb. He told the San Francisco Chronicle that in the rubble he found a teacup with what appeared to be human flesh melted on it.
""In that instant, I became a total pacifist,"" he said.
In addition to Ginsberg, Kerouac and Burroughs, Ferlinghetti published works by Beat figures such as Neal Cassady, Gary Snyder, Gregory Corso and Philip Lamantia, as well as Sam Shepard and Charles Bukowski.
When asked how he remained prolific and lived to 100, he told NPR: ""Have a good laugh and you'll live longer.""

Ferlinghetti, who also was a painter, had two children.

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 06:36PM ET</span>",Last statue of dictator Franco removed in 'historic day' for Spain,"MELILLA, Spain (Reuters) - The last statue of former Spanish dictator Francisco Franco was removed on Tuesday from the city gates of Melilla, a Spanish enclave and autonomous city on the northwest African coast.
Without much fanfare, a group of workmen operated a mechanical digger and heavy drills to chip away at the brick platform on which the statue stood, lifted it off by a chain around its neck and carted it away in bubble wrap on a pickup truck.
The statue, erected three years after Franco's death in 1978, commemorated his role as commander of the Spanish Legion in the Rif War, a conflict fought in the 1920s by Spain and France against the Berber tribes of the Rif mountainous region of Morocco.
""This is a historic day for Melilla,"" Elena Fernandez Trevino, in charge of education and culture in the enclave, said on Monday after the local assembly voted to take the statue down, pointing out that it was ""the only statue dedicated to a dictator still in the public sphere in Europe.""
Only the far-right Vox party voted against the move, arguing that the statue celebrated Franco's military role and not his dictatorship, so the Historical Memory Law, a 2007 statute calling for the removal of all symbols connected to Franco's regime, should not apply.

The Spanish government has made several high-profile removals off the back of this law, including taking over the former dictator's summer palace from his heirs last September.

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 06:01PM ET</span>",New York grand jury votes not to indict police officers for Daniel Prude death,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A grand jury in New York state voted not to indict police officers for the death of Daniel Prude, a Black man who died of asphyxiation while in police custody in March 2020 in the city of Rochester, state Attorney General Letitia James said on Tuesday.
Prude's family obtained body-worn camera footage of Prude's death that showed him naked in a dark, snowy street. A so-called mesh ""spit hood"" was placed over his head after he told officers he had contracted the novel coronavirus. The video also shows Prude, apparently in the middle of a mental health crisis, being restrained against the ground by police. 
The footage was released in September, further fueling ongoing nationwide protests against police violence following other high-profile episodes in 2020 where police killed Black men and women, including the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police in May.
The trial of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer seen kneeling in videos on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, begins in Minneapolis on March 8.
James said her office had hoped to secure indictments in the death of Prude, a 41-year-old father of five children who lived in Chicago.
""I know that the Prude family, the Rochester community and communities across the country will rightfully be disappointed this outcome,"" James said at a news conference in Rochester, a city in upstate New York. Citing the court-enforced secrecy surrounding grand-jury proceedings, James declined to say what charges her office had presented to jurors.
A lawyer for Prude's family and the Rochester mayor's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Prude had visited his brother and ran out of the house in the middle of the night, prompting the brother to call the police, concerned for Prude's mental health and reporting that he had taken PCP, an illegal drug.
Police officers found Prude naked, approached him with a stun-gun and told him to put his hands behind his back so they could handcuff him, which Prude did, according to a report by James' office. Less than 10 minutes later, he stopped breathing. Efforts to revive him foundered in the ambulance, and he was taken off life support a week later.
An autopsy found he died of asphyxiation following the restraining holds used by police and excited delirium, a complex syndrome that can be triggered by recreational drug use. 
Soon after the video emerged last September, Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren fired Police Chief La'Ron Singletary. Seven police officers involved in the arrest were suspended; their lawyers told local media they had followed their police training appropriately.
Singletary's successor, Police Chief Cynthia Herriott-Sullivan, said in a statement her department would respect the jury's decision and that it would continue to reform the way its officers respond to mental illness.
""My heart goes out to the Prude family during this difficult time,"" her statement said. The officers involved remain suspended while an internal investigation continues, she said.
Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, criticized the grand jury for choosing ""impunity, not accountability.""
""The Rochester Police Department took Daniel Prude’s life while he was in crisis,"" Lieberman said in a statement. ""He deserved services and supports, not for his life to end.""

James, the attorney general, also made new recommendations for how cities respond to mental health crises on Tuesday, urging that emergency personnel be trained in recognizing the symptoms of excited delirium syndrome.

(Reuters) - Prosecutors investigating the shooting death in Ohio of an unarmed Black man by a white store owner are re-examining two earlier robberies they had linked to the dead man, in a case his family wants investigated as a federal civil rights violation.
Hamilton County Prosecutor Joseph Deters announced in December that no charges would be filed against the store owner who shot Da’Shawn Tye, 19, after concluding that Tye was attempting to rob the store for a third time and that the owner feared for his life.
Tye’s family contends there is no evidence their son acted improperly on Nov. 19 or that he was the robber at the Mages Grocery in Cincinnati on Aug. 8 and Nov. 14.
No weapon was found on or near Tye, according to the family's attorney Fanon Rucker. In January, Rucker asked the U.S. Department of Justice to open a civil rights investigation into the case. 
The Chief Assistant Prosecutor of the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office, Mark Piepmeier, told Reuters he has asked the Cincinnati Police to re-investigate the earlier robberies.
“I asked the Cincinnati Police department to do a complete investigation of the earlier robberies as if Tye had lived and we were going to prosecute him for those robberies,” Piepmeier said in an email on Monday.
“This is being done to satisfy his family that he had done the earlier robberies and that is why the storeowner was justifiably in fear when Tye appeared on the day of the fatal shooting.""
Tye's family says their son is not depicted in the two still images of the earlier incidents shown to them by Cincinnati homicide detectives. Prosecutors have refused to release those images to the Tye family's lawyers or the public, citing the ongoing investigation.
The store owner, Michael Mages, 60, has referred questions to his attorney, Erin Moore. In an email, Moore refused to comment ""while there is pending or the potential for investigation or litigation.""

The Justice Department has acknowledged receiving the family's request for a probe, but has not commented further.

1611,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 05:01PM ET</span>",Wife of Mexican drug kingpin 'El Chapo' held in jail on U.S. charges of helping him run cartel,"By Sarah N. Lynch and Jonathan Stempel
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday ordered Emma Coronel Aispuro, the wife of Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, to be detained on charges she conspired with her husband to run a multibillion dollar drug enterprise while he was behind bars.
The arrest of Coronel, 31, at Dulles International Airport near Washington on Monday was the highest-profile U.S. capture of a Mexican on drug charges since former Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos was detained in October.
Coronel ""worked closely with the command and control structure of the Mexican drug trafficking organization known as the Sinaloa cartel - most notably with her husband, Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, the leader of the cartel,"" prosecutor Anthony Nardozzi said at a federal court hearing.
""The defendant has access to criminal associates who are members of the Sinaloa cartel, as well as financial means to generate a serious risk of flight,"" he added.
Coronel is being held at an Alexandria, Virginia, jail and her lawyers are expected to apply for bail.
She has not yet entered a plea.
Coronel, a dual U.S.-Mexico citizen, met Guzman when she was a young beauty queen, and married him in 2007 at age 18. The couple has twin daughters.
In 2019, Coronel launched a clothing brand in the United States and she also appeared in a U.S. reality show about mafia families.
Prosecutors said Coronel grew up understanding the drug business and the reach of the Sinaloa cartel. 
Authorities said Coronel relayed messages to help Guzman conduct drug trafficking from 2012 to early 2014, and continued delivering messages while visiting him in a Mexican prison following his February 2014 arrest.
They also said Coronel conspired in Guzman's famous July 2015 escape from the Altiplano prison in Mexico through a mile-long tunnel dug from his cell, and began plotting another escape following his January 2016 capture by Mexican authorities. 
Guzman, 63, was convicted in February 2019 in a high-profile Brooklyn trial for trafficking tons of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine into the United States over two decades.
He was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years, and locked up in the federal Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.
Coronel was a regular presence at her husband's trial. 
Mexico's president said on Tuesday that Coronel's arrest was a U.S. matter but he hoped the U.S. government would share more information.
Joint efforts to fight drug trafficking were strained after Cienfuegos' arrest, with Mexico's government moving to restrict U.S. agents' activities in Mexico in retaliation for what it called a breach of trust.
The U.S. Department of Justice unexpectedly dropped the Cienfuegos case and let him return to Mexico. Mexico dropped its own case against him in January. 
A Justice Department official said the case against Coronel is part of a long history of pursuing drug traffickers, and not reflective of a new push by the Biden administration.
Coronel was charged with conspiring with her husband to distribute heroin, cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine for unlawful importation into the United States.

If convicted on all charges, Coronel faces up to life in prison and a potential $10 million fine.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they shot down the Ukraine International Airlines plane on Jan. 8, 2020, in error shortly after takeoff, mistaking it for a missile at a time when tensions with Washington were high over the U.S. assassination five days earlier of Guards General Qassem Soleimani.
All 176 people on board were killed, 138 of whom had ties to Canada. 
Agnes Callamard, the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, told reporters she had found no concrete evidence that the targeting of the plane was premeditated and intentional.
But she added that ""inconsistencies in the official explanation and the reckless nature of the mistakes have led many, including myself, to question whether the downing of flight PS752 was intentional.""
Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Callamard said Tehran's explanation contained a number of contradictions, including on the timing of the window to fire and on communication. It has provided no information on why flights that took off earlier that night were not targeted, she said.
Callamard said the question of whether the plane was shot down intentionally needed to be further investigated, including by Iran.
""They have not proven beyond any reasonable doubt that the plane was not intentionally targeted,"" she said.
The Iranian authorities failed to investigate the strike in line with international standards, Callamard said, citing that Iran's government continued to deny the flight had been shot down for three days and that it appears evidence was destroyed.
Callamard said she sent the Iranian government a letter in December detailing her investigation and requesting answers about the strike, but has yet to receive a response.
The decision not to quickly publicly state that the plane was shot down in an Iranian strike constitutes ""an extremely grave violation of the right to life,"" she said.

Callamard also questioned why Iran had not closed its airspace for civilian traffic that night amid the concern that tensions with the United States could increase.

Perez, 51, has been walking through the Andean nation to denounce what he calls manipulation of poll statements that left him in third place, after left-wing economist Andres Arauz and conservative banker Guillermo Lasso.
The elections council on Sunday confirmed that Arauz and Lasso will advance to the April 11 runoff, with the final tally showing Perez less than a percentage point behind Lasso.
Demonstrators arrived by bus in southern Quito on Tuesday carrying the flag of the Pachakutik party that backs Perez. They congregated in a park and shouted slogans including ""transparency yes, fraud no.""
""We are going to give the National Electoral Council one last chance,"" Perez said at a rally in a Quito park. ""This fraud cannot go unpunished, nobody can hide it."" 
He later took boxes with more than 16,000 poll statements that he says show inconsistencies to the elections council.
Candidates can file objections or contest the results of the vote before the electoral council or the elections court.
Perez wants a recount in 17 of Ecuador's 24 provinces.
Arauz won the first round with 32.72% of the votes, while Lasso got 19.74% and Perez 19.39%.
Perez made a surprisingly strong showing after running on a platform to protect water resources from the mining industry and to recover money from corruption by previous leaders.

""Yaku is a leader and worker just like us, he walks together with us,"" said Rosa Salinas, 58, who makes a living weaving straw hats. ""We want transparency, we don't want politicians to deceive us.""

1614,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 04:10PM ET</span>",Colorado city to establish independent police monitor in wake of Elijah McClain's death,"By Keith Coffman
DENVER (Reuters) - U.S. officials in a Colorado city where a young Black man died in police custody in 2019 say their system of accountability failed.
The acknowledgement on Tuesday came a day after an independent panel hired by Aurora's City Council found that police stopped Elijah McClain even though they had no apparent reason to suspect a crime was being committed, and that a subsequent internal police investigation of the incident was flawed. 
The 23-year-old went into cardiac arrest soon after an officer put him in a chokehold as he cried and pleaded for him to stop. 
""We've identified the root of this case and it's the failure of a system of accountability,"" said City Manager Jim Twombly, referring to McClain's death. 
""I will be pursuing with the mayor and city council the establishment of an independent monitor to enhance accountability and transparency of the police department and regain the trust of the public,"" he added.
Twombly did not elaborate on the proposal for an independent monitor.
McClain family attorney Mari Newman told Reuters by telephone that the ""devil is in the details"" with respect to the creation of an independent monitor.
""Without the authority to actually make and enforce changes, it's a symbolic gesture,"" she said.
No officers involved in McClain's death have been disciplined. Initial internal probes determined that the officers and paramedics involved in McClain's death had not violated policy. The district attorney declined to file charges in the case.
Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson said she knows McClain's death has spurred anger and pain, saying ""the bottom line is that Elijah McClain should still be alive today."" She vowed that the police department will ""address our failures"" and build trust.
According to the 153-page report released Monday, an Aurora police officer decided in less than 10 seconds after McClain was stopped as he was walking alone late on Aug. 24, 2019 ""to turn what may have been a consensual encounter with Mr. McClain into an investigatory stop"" without apparent grounds. 
After the arrest, police called paramedics, who administered a dose of ketamine, a sedative. McClain died days later in hospital.

The independent investigators concluded that paramedics failed to properly examine McClain before injecting the sedative.

1616,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 03:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: French antitrust investigators say Google breached its orders on talks with news publishers - sources,"By Mathieu Rosemain
PARIS (Reuters) - French antitrust investigators have accused Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google of failing to comply with the state competition authority's orders on how to conduct negotiations with news publishers over copyright, two sources who read the investigators' report said.
In the 93-page report, known as a statement of objections, the investigators wrote that Google's failure to comply was of an exceptionally serious nature, the sources said. 
This comes amid complaints by French news publishers that Google failed to hold talks with them in good faith to find an agreement. The same publishers were not part of the $76 million three-year deal signed between the U.S. firm and and a group of 121 publications, as Reuters reported earlier this month.
The agreement was presented as a major step forward by both Google and the publishers who signed it, but left many publications infuriated.
The French competition authority can impose fines of up to 10% of sales on firms it deems in violation of its rules. Google's annual sales amounted to about $183 billion in 2020.
The investigative report is a key element in the authority's sanction process, but it is up to the watchdog's board, led by Isabelle de Silva, to decide whether to issue a penalty. 
The biggest penalty ever levied by the French antitrust authority was against iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) last year, with a 1.1 billion-euro ($1.34 billion) fine for anti-competitive behaviour towards its distribution and retail network.
A spokeswoman for the competition authority declined to comment.
In response to a Reuters request for comment, Google said in a statement: ""Our priority is to comply with the law, and to continue to negotiate with publishers in good faith, as evidenced by the agreements we have made with publishers in the past few months."" 
""We will now review the statement of objections, and will work closely with the French competition authority,"" it said.
The French report on Google's negotiating tactics comes at a time when countries around the world are pushing U.S. internet giants such as Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) to share more revenue with news publishers. The issue gained international attention this week when Facebook banned all news from its services in Australia over a draft law there that would mandate arbitration.
According to the two sources, the French investigators say Google did not comply with requests from the watchdog to start negotiations with the publishers within a three-month deadline, and to provide all data the watchdog felt publishers needed.
The publishers' lobby that signed the deal with Google, APIG, did not immediately reply to a request for comment. French news agency AFP, and another media lobby group, SEPM - both of which did not sign a deal with Google - did not respond to requests for comment.
Reuters reached its own global deal with Google in January on terms that have not been publicly disclosed.

So a decision by the Ecologist Green Party mayor of Lyon that only vegetarian meals will temporarily be served in the city's schools due to meat supply problems caused by the pandemic, led to vehement criticism by the agriculture and interior ministers.
They in turn were sharply rebuked by the environment minister, in an unusual display of discord within the cabinet. 
Citing logistics problems, Lyon's mayor Gregory Doucet decided to temporarily provide the city's 29,000 school children meals without meat from Monday, although the city will still serve eggs and fish. 
""This is absurd from a nutritional point of view and a scandal from a social point of view,"" Agriculture Minister Julien Denormandie said on RTL radio on Tuesday.
On his Twitter feed on Saturday, conservative Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin slammed the ""scandalous ideology"" of the Lyon city government. 
""Besides being an unacceptable insult to France's farmers and butchers, it is clear that the Greens' moralist and elitist policies exclude low-income people. For many children, the school canteen is the only place where they get to eat meat,"" he said.
During a visit to a school restaurant on the French Atlantic coast on Monday, Environment Minister Barbara Pompili praised a menu of zucchini soup, spaghetti with lentils, carrots and tomatoes, goat cheese and a pear dessert. 
She said that under new government policies, schools would be encouraged to experiment with a daily vegetarian menu option and she called the debate about the Lyon menu ""prehistoric"".
Environmentalists argue that meat uses up an inordinate amount of land compared to plant-based protein and worsens climate change and deforestation. 
During an agriculture-themed visit to a farm on Tuesday, Macron tip-toed around the issue pleading for ""a complete model of nutrition"" and ""quality meat"" produced in France. 

In recent years, several French environment ministers have proposed more vegetarian options in school canteens but have met with strong opposition from France's powerful agriculture lobby.

Britain's exit from the EU's trading orbit in January has created trade barriers between Northern Ireland - which remains in the EU's single market for goods - and the rest of the United Kingdom.
Maros Sefcovic, a vice president of the European Commission, said he hoped to learn of British efforts during an online meeting on Wednesday .
""I was also reminding my British partners that this must be a two-way street,"" he told a news conference.
Sefcovic said real-time access to the IT systems of customs could smooth customs processes and a trusted trader scheme could ensure Northern Irish supermarkets were properly supplied. 
""I hope that tomorrow... we will get feedback from our UK partners on how all these flexibilities and grace periods are being used because it's clearly a pre-requisite for the EU, the Commission and the member states to assess any further requests,"" Sefcovic said.
The EU's insistence on Britain honouring its withdrawal treaty has left the British province of Northern Ireland within the EU's single market and put a customs border in the Irish Sea dividing the province from mainland Britain.
Sefcovic said that there were inevitable consequences of Brexit so not everything could be resolved.
Members of Northern Ireland's two largest pro-British parties have said they are set take part in legal action challenging part of Britain's divorce deal.
However, Sefcovic said companies there might over time see the divorce arrangements as an advantage.

In a statement published late on Monday the ASF said it had ordered a review into its report after finding ""inconsistencies"". Its figure for the cost of cancelling the airport had been too high, due to a flaw in methodology, it said.
Lopez Obrador has defended his 2018 decision to cancel the airport, his predecessor's flagship project. In 2019, the transport ministry estimated the cost of the cancellation at 100 million pesos.
At a news conference on Monday, Lopez Obrador criticized the ASF, calling its figures an exaggeration and demanding the auditor explain how it arrived at them.
The ASF said it would publish a final revised report once its review was complete.
Lopez Obrador canceled the airport after arguing that the project, initially slated to cost $13 billion, was riddled with corruption and geologically unsound. His party oversaw a public consultation on the decision, but his opponents said this was too limited, as barely 1 percent of the population took part.
The cancellation sent shock waves through financial markets, and the government has paid billions of dollars to compensate investors. Nevertheless, Lopez Obrador has always maintained that his decision saved the public coffers.

Afterwards, he ordered the construction of a cheaper alternative airport north of the city, overseen by the army.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's government must improve its protection of human rights activists and civilians, be more present in remote, poor areas, and fully implement a peace deal with FARC rebels to curb violence, the United Nations' human rights body said on Tuesday.
The murders of activists and mass killings have made President Ivan Duque the target of frequent criticism by the international community and advocacy groups. His government largely blames the violence on drug trafficking. 
The UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights tallied 133 murders of activists and community leaders last year, up 25 from the year before. The government said on Monday it had recorded just 66, but that 63 others were being investigated.
The full implementation of a 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels, which initially led to a reduction in violence, is key to stemming the violence, the UN body said.
""The most important thing is to put the peace deal in the center of the government's response, reinforcing the mechanisms created by the deal"" for this situation, Juliette de Rivero, the U.N. office's Colombia representative, said in a virtual press conference.
The Colombian government was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday.
The 2016 accord saw some 13,000 FARC members demobilize and the group become a legal political party.
The government must also dismantle armed groups including the still-active ELN rebels, former FARC fighters who reject the peace deal and crime gangs run by ex-paramilitaries, which are responsible for killing activists who resist them.
The murders of at least 248 FARC ex-combatants since the accord was signed is due to ""an absence of comprehensive state presence"" in some regions, de Rivero said.

Before the commission's mandate expires in November, all of Colombian society, including the military, should contribute to efforts by a truth commission created under the deal to clarify events which took place during the half-century conflict.

It is a rare direct denial and the first time the Kataib Hezbollah group, one of the Iraqi factions closest to Iran, has commented on the most serious incident this year, a rocket attack in Erbil on Feb. 15 that killed a contractor working with U.S.-led forces.
The attacks over the past 10 days are an escalation against U.S. sites in Iraq at a time when Washington and Tehran are looking for a way to return to the nuclear deal abandoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump.
Kataib Hezbollah, the most high-profile Iran-backed militia in Iraq, does not usually comment on specific attacks. 
Its direct denial of actions against U.S. interests while Washington says it is still determining who carried out the Erbil attack is a sign that Iran and its allies wish to avoid an escalation that could bring a tough U.S. response.
Some Western and Iraqi officials say the attacks, often claimed by little-known groups, are being carried out by militants with links to Kataib Hezbollah as a way for Iranian allies to harass U.S. forces without being held accountable.
""We absolutely did not target Erbil or the Green Zone and have no knowledge of the group that did,"" Kataib Hezbollah spokesman Mohammed Mohi told Reuters.
In the Feb. 15 attack, rockets hit the U.S. military base housed at Erbil International Airport in the Kurdish-run region killing one non-American contractor. Another salvo struck a base hosting U.S. forces north of Baghdad days later hurting at least one contractor. 
Rockets hit Baghdad's Green Zone on Monday which houses the U.S. embassy and other diplomatic missions.
Mohi, whose group demands a withdrawal of 2,500 U.S. troops stationed in Iraq and opposes Western influence there, said those who carried out the attacks wanted Washington to harden its stance on Iran or target Iraqi militia.
He said a chance must be given for a U.S.-Iranian detente, which could result in U.S. troops leaving the country.
Tensions have been high in Iraq and the wider region since the U.S. killing of Iranian military mastermind Qassem Soleimani and Kataib Hezbollah senior leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in Baghdad in January 2020 sparked fears of a full regional war.
Washington's Gulf Arab ally Riyadh has been increasingly targeted in the past year, including two aerial assaults in the past weeks.
Some Western and regional officials have said one of those, on Jan. 23, which Saudi Arabia said it thwarted, appeared to be launched from Iraqi soil for the first time. Iraqi security officials have said they have no evidence it was launched from Iraq.
Mohi did not comment on whether Kataib Hezbollah had any links with the group that claimed the attack, Alwiyat Alwaad Alhaqq.

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt agreed in January at a summit in Saudi's al-Ula to restore diplomatic, trade and travel ties with Doha, which had been severed in 2017 over accusations that Qatar supported terrorism, a charge it denies.
Qatar on Monday similarly met a delegation from the United Arab Emirates in Kuwait for their first bilateral talks. 
""The two sides welcomed measures each has taken since signing the al-Ula statement, as a step on the path of building confidence between the two fraternal countries,"" the statement said. 
Since the agreement, air and travel links have resumed between Qatar and the four states. Each state is to arrange bilateral talks with Qatar to resolve individual issues.
Bahrain's foreign ministry said last month it had written to Qatar inviting Doha to send a delegation to Bahrain to start bilateral talks to implement the al-Ula agreement. Qatar has not yet responded, Bahrain's foreign minister has said.
Washington has strong ties with all the states involved, including Qatar which hosts the largest U.S. military base in the region, and has seen the rift as a threat to efforts to contain Iran. It has pushed for a united Gulf front.

The row also rattled Arab power politics in the region, where Gulf states have used their financial and political clout to influence events in Libya, Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Emma Coronel Aispuro was arrested at an airport just outside Washington and charged with helping Guzman continue to run his drug cartel during his incarceration.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters at a regular morning news conference that he hoped the U.S. government would share more information about the arrest.
""It's a matter that the United States will decide,"" he said, speculating that her arrest may be linked to the case of former Mexican Security Minister Genaro Garcia Luna, who was also criminally charged last year in a U.S. court.
Coronel Aispuro, a 31-year-old former beauty queen, was a regular attendee at her husband's high-profile New York trial two years ago where he was convicted of trafficking tons of drugs into the United States.

She was charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with conspiracy to import drugs including heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine into the United States, and is expected to appear in court in Washington later on Tuesday.

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 11:45AM ET</span>","Iran's rulers close ranks, raise pressure on Biden to lift sanctions","By Parisa Hafezi
DUBAI (Reuters) - An Iranian state newspaper, taking aim at hardline lawmakers' intervention in Tehran's nuclear row with the West, warned on Tuesday that overly radical actions may lead to Iran's isolation after a new law ended snap inspections by U.N. inspectors.
Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers has been fraying since 2018 when the United States pulled out and reimposed harsh sanctions on Tehran, prompting it to breach the deal's limits on uranium enrichment, a potential pathway to nuclear weapons.
On Monday, Iranian lawmakers protested against the government's decision to permit “necessary” monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency for up to three months, saying the move broke a new law they passed that mandated an end to IAEA snap inspections as of Tuesday. 
Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to observe the IAEA's Additional Protocol that permits short-notice inspections at locations not declared to the agency - to bolster confidence that nuclear work is not being covertly put to military ends. 
The three-month compromise secured by the IAEA's director-general on a trip to Tehran last weekend kept alive hopes for an eventual diplomatic solution to rescue the nuclear deal. 
But the state newspaper Iran, seen as close to pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani, a former chief nuclear negotiator, suggested in an unusually critical commentary that the new law blocking snap inspections could be counter-productive. 
""Those who say Iran must take swift tough action on the nuclear accord should say what guarantee there is that Iran will not be left alone as in the past..., and will this end anywhere other than helping build a consensus against Iran?"" it said.
Later on Tuesday, the three major European parties to the nuclear deal called on Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA and reverse steps that reduce transparency, saying its suspension of the Additional Protocol was deeply regrettable.
Both Tehran, whose economy has been crippled by sanctions, and new U.S. President Joe Biden's administration want to salvage the deal repudiated by his predecessor Donald Trump, but disagree over who should take the first step. Iran insists the United States must first lift sanctions, while Washington avers that Tehran must first return to compliance with the pact. 
Since Trump's pull-out in 2018, Iran has been rebuilding stockpiles of low-enriched uranium, enriching it to higher levels of fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up production.
HIGH-LEVEL SHOW OF UNITY
Biden's refusal to lift sanctions first has been met by a show of unity from both sides of Iran’s political divide, uniting hardliners who cast the United States as an implacable enemy with pragmatists who seek rapprochement with the West.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, although the top hardliner with the last word on policy, endorsed the inspections deal with the IAEA in a tacit rebuff of hawkish lawmakers.
The hardline daily Kayhan, whose editor-in-chief is appointed by Khamenei, also approved it, saying the deal ""could not have been prepared without the participation and opinion of the Supreme National Security Council"". 
But Iran's overall strategy appears to be cranking up enrichment and raising questions about cooperation with the IAEA to push the Biden administration into dropping the ""maximum pressure"" campaign of sanctions launched by Trump.
Khamenei, upping the ante on Monday, said Iran might enrich uranium up to 60% purity if needed, while repeating a denial of any Iranian intent to seek nuclear weapons, for which 90% enrichment would be required.
""Iran's economy is doing badly because of sanctions, COVID-19 crisis and mismanagement,"" said Meir Javedanefar, a lecturer at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya in Israel.
""Therefore, if Biden takes the first step by removing at least part of the sanctions..., Khamenei would be willing to reach a deal with him.""
Washington, which said last week it was ready to talk to Tehran, said Khamenei's comments ""sounds like a threat"" but reiterated U.S. willingness to engage with Iran about returning to the 2015 nuclear deal. 
Iran’s clerical rulers face challenges in keeping the economy afloat under U.S. sanctions that have slashed its vital oil exports.

The economic hardship bodes ill for the presidential election in June, when Iran’s rulers typically seek a high turnout to show their legitimacy, even if the outcome will not change any major policy that is decided by Khamenei.

1626,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 11:27AM ET</span>",Indonesian foreign minister to visit Myanmar as pressure mounts on generals,"(Reuters) - Indonesia’s foreign minister plans to fly to Myanmar on Thursday in the first known visit by a foreign envoy since the Feb. 1 military coup, a leaked government document said, as Western pressure mounts over a crackdown on protesters.
Retno Marsudi will arrive in the capital Naypyitaw in the morning and depart several hours later, according to the letter from the Ministry of Transport dated Feb. 23 seen by Reuters, which an official said was authentic. 
Retno has been rallying support in Southeast Asia for a special meeting on Myanmar and sources said Jakarta proposed the region sends monitors to ensure the generals hold “fair and inclusive elections”.
The proposal was met with anger from some of the protesters, who are demanding the immediate release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and recognition of the November polls won by her party.
Hundreds gathered outside Indonesia's embassy in Yangon on Tuesday to voice their opposition to the election proposal.
The meeting in Myanmar prompted scepticism from some Twitter users and The Future Nation Alliance, a Myanmar-based activist group, said in a statement a visit by Retno would be “tantamount to recognising the military junta”. 
The group demanded foreign officials meet with Htin Lin Aung, a representative of the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), formed by ousted lawmakers, who has been appointed the “sole responsible official for foreign relations”.
“We strongly oppose and condemn Indonesia for sending a government envoy to Burma for official communications with the coup regime,” the statement said.
An Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman said Retno was in Thailand and may travel to other countries in the region afterwards but could not confirm which. Earlier, he said a new election was not Indonesia’s position.
The move emerged as the leader of the new junta called for energetic efforts to revive an ailing economy and Western countries considered more sanctions. 
A general strike shut businesses on Monday and huge crowds gathered to denounce the military's Feb. 1 coup and demand the release of Suu Kyi and her allies, despite a warning from authorities that confrontation could get people killed.
The Group of Seven (G7) rich nations on Tuesday condemned intimidation and oppression of those opposing the coup. ""Anyone responding to peaceful protests with violence must be held to account,"" group foreign ministers said in a joint statement.
'AILING ECONOMY'
Protesters gathered again on Tuesday though in much smaller numbers. There were also small marches in favour of the military, media reported. 
There were no reports of violence.
Military chief General Min Aung Hlaing, in a meeting with his ruling council on Monday, called for state spending and imports to be cut and exports increased.
""The council needs to put its energy into reviving the country's ailing economy. Economic remedy measures must be taken,"" state media quoted him a saying.
The army seized power after alleging fraud in Nov. 8 elections, detaining Suu Kyi and much of the party leadership. The electoral commission dismissed the fraud complaints.
The crisis raises the prospect of isolation and investor jitters just as the COVID-19 pandemic has undermined consumption and choked off tourism.
Min Aung Hlaing did not link the protests directly to economic problems but said the authorities were following a democratic path in dealing with them and police were using minimal force, such as rubber bullets, state media reported.
The security forces have shown more restraint compared with earlier crackdowns against people who had pushed for democracy during almost half a century of direct military rule. 
Even so, three protesters have been shot and killed. The army has said one policeman died of injuries sustained during the protests.
The military has accused protesters of provoking violence but U.N. Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews said the millions who marched on Monday in a ""breathtaking"" turnout showed they were prepared to face up to military threats.
""The generals are losing their power to intimidate and with it, their power. It is past time for them to stand down, as the people of Myanmar stand up,"" Andrews said on Twitter. 
SANCTIONS
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Tuesday called for restoring the ""legitimate civilian government"", adding: ""There, as everywhere, democracy must prevail
The European Union said it was considering sanctions that would target businesses owned by the army, but the bloc ruled out any curtailing its trade preferences to avoid hurting poor workers.
""We are not prepared to stand by and watch,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in Brussels on Monday.
Singapore's central bank said it had not found significant funds from Myanmar in banks in Singapore but warned them to remain vigilant to any transactions with companies and individuals subject to sanctions.
The United States imposed sanctions on two more members of the junta and warned it could take more action. It had already placed sanctions on Myanmar's acting president, several military officers and three companies in the jade and gems sector.

Myanmar's giant neighbour China, which has traditionally taken a softer line, said any international action should contribute to stability, promote reconciliation and avoid complicating the situation, media reported.

1627,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 11:00AM ET</span>",UK's Johnson suggests he left journalism because he was always abusing people in print,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested on Tuesday that he had left journalism for politics, because in his original profession he often found himself abusing people in print.
Johnson, 56, has displayed a colourful, sometimes combative speaking and writing style both as a journalist and as a politician, a trait which has fuelled many controversies during his three decades in the public eye.
""When you're a journalist, it's a great, great job. It's a great profession. But the trouble is that you always, sometimes, you find yourself always abusing people, attacking people,"" he said during a visit to a school on Tuesday.
""Not that you want to abuse and attack them, but you are being critical. You're being critical when maybe you feel sometimes a bit guilty about that because you haven't put yourself in the place of the person you're criticising.""
Johnson concluded his off-the-cuff remarks by suggesting that it was those aspects of journalism that had driven him to give politics a go instead.
The opposition Labour Party said Johnson should apologise to journalists. 
""We know from Donald Trump that these kind of assaults on the free press are dangerous and designed to stir up distrust and division,"" said Labour's media policy chief, lawmaker Chris Matheson.
""For Boris Johnson to say journalists are 'always abusing people' probably says more about his own career,"" he added.
As a young man, Johnson was sacked from his first job in journalism, at the Times newspaper, for making up a quote. 
He went on to have a successful career at the Daily Telegraph, where he made his name as a Brussels correspondent lambasting the European Union in vivid if not always entirely accurate prose.
He later pursued parallel media and political careers as editor of the Spectator magazine and as a member of parliament.
Even in more recent years, when he has focused more on successive political jobs as mayor of London, foreign affairs minister and prime minister, he has written frequent newspaper columns in his trademark style.

In the latest of a series of similar examples, he caused a major public row with a 2018 column in which he likened Muslim women wearing burqas to letter boxes and bank robbers.

""We are now in the third wave,"" they quoted her as saying and said she warned that any easing of lockdown measures introduced late last year and extended until March 7 would have to be done carefully and gradually.
The closure of all non-essential businesses and border controls with Austria and the Czech Republic, where there have been outbreaks linked to a more infectious variant of the virus, have helped Germany bring down new daily COVID-19 infections.
But a slow vaccination roll-out and the risk of major outbreaks of fast-spreading variants already identified in Germany could make any easing of restrictions more difficult.
""We cannot afford ups and downs,"" Merkel told participants, suggesting she wanted any return to normal life to be done carefully to avoid having to reintroduce lockdown measures if infections start to rise again.

She added that making rapid tests more available and boosting testing capacity could make a return to normality more durable, said the sources.

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 10:31AM ET</span>",Gas to Gaza? The pipeline that might provide a lifeline,"By Ari Rabinovitch and Nidal al-Mughrabi
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Talks on a gas pipeline that would cross political faultlines and deliver reliable energy to the impoverished Gaza Strip have moved from the abstract to the concrete in recent weeks, three officials with knowledge of the process told Reuters.
For years the project was a distant prospect because of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - peace talks between the two sides broke down in 2014 and never resumed, amid mutual suspicion and outbreaks of violence.
But Israeli, Palestinian, Qatari and European interests have converged in recent weeks with the aim of getting gas flowing to Gaza in 2023, say the officials.
The plan would see natural gas from the deepwater Leviathan field operated by  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) in the eastern Mediterranean flow through an existing pipeline into Israel, and from there into Gaza through a proposed new extension.
Under the arrangement, which has yet to be finalized, the Israeli side of the planned pipeline would be funded by Qatar and the section in Gaza paid for by the European Union, the officials told Reuters.
If successful, the pipeline project would for the first time in years provide a steady energy source to the Gaza Strip, ending rolling blackouts that have helped cripple the economy of the blockaded Palestinian enclave.
""We are talking about Gaza having 24 hours of electricity, providing a basis for major economic growth and a contributor to peace and stability,"" said Ariel Ezrahi, director of energy for the Office of the Quartet, a group promoting peace efforts between the Palestinians and Israelis which reports to the United States, United Nations, European Union and Russia.
""Recent events have constituted a real breakthrough,"" said Ezrahi, who chairs the Gas for Gaza task force that has been funded by the Dutch government since 2015. 
LEVIATHAN
The Quartet office sees the Palestinians initially buying about 0.2 billion cubic meters (BCM) of gas a year, perhaps rising to 1 BCM as the plant expands and other consumers join.
The European Union last week committed an initial 5 million euros to fund the Gaza portion of the pipeline, which will run about 4km and cost around 20 million euros.
Qatari envoy to the Gaza Strip Mohammed Al-Emadi last week told Gaza-based news agency SAWA that his country would fund the Israeli segment of the pipeline, which officials say will stretch some 45km and cost around 70 million euros.
Palestinian and Israeli officials told Reuters that Qatar is ready to pay for the pipeline in Israel. Emadi's office and Qatar's government press office did not respond to Reuters queries.
Israel's Leviathan field is already exporting gas to neighbouring Jordan and Egypt.
Asked about the Gaza pipeline, Chevron said it looked ""forward to supporting Israel's strategy to develop its energy resources for the benefit of the country and the region"" but that it did not comment ""on matters of a commercial nature"".
Its main Israeli partner in Leviathan, Delek Drilling, declined to comment.
SEALED OFF
Gaza, home to two million Palestinians, is a 360 sq. km coastal enclave that lies between Egypt's Sinai peninsula and Tel Aviv. 
It has no access to the outside world except through Israel, which controls 90% of its land and sea boundaries, and Egypt, which has a narrow land border to the south.
Both countries have for years maintained a tight blockade, citing security concerns about the Islamist militant group Hamas, which seized control of Gaza in 2007.
Today, Gaza's sole power station produces electricity for around 12 hours a day on diesel, a more expensive and polluting fuel.
The pipeline will enable the power station to double, perhaps quadruple, generation capacity. The Quartet office estimates it will add more than $1 billion to the Palestinian gross domestic product.
POLITICS AND POWER
While a cheaper and more reliable source of power might ease the economic plight of Gazans - thereby contributing to stability in the region - few expect it to be a panacea.
Indeed the power station at the end of the proposed pipeline has already proved vulnerable to politics.
In 2006 it was bombed by Israel after Hamas militants from Gaza captured an Israeli soldier in a cross-border raid.
And over the past decade a bitter feud between Hamas and its main domestic rival, President Mahmoud Abbas, has seen the two sides accuse each other of worsening the power crisis.
Abbas's western-backed Palestinian Authority will be handling the final talks with the Israeli gas company, Palestinian officials said.
Palestine Electric Company (PEC) vice chairman Walid Salman said he hoped agreement could be reached in weeks - allowing electricity costs to drop 60% and generation to double to a maximum 140 megawatts.
He said they have been speaking to Delek about a 5-year gas deal. 
In Israel, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said the project was being done ""in full coordination with us.""
That includes the defense establishment and state-owned Israel National Gas Lines, whose CEO said plans for a 24-inch pipeline that can carry ""significant amounts of gas"" are ready.

They are waiting for a final deal, perhaps in the coming weeks, to begin construction.

The vaccination was launched in Gouecke, a rural community in N’Zerekore prefecture, where the first cases were detected on Feb. 14, the WHO said, adding that the launch started with vaccination of health workers.
""The vaccination uses the 'ring strategy' where all people who have come into contact with a confirmed Ebola patient are given the vaccine, as well as frontline and health workers,"" the WHO said in a statement.
The resurgence of the virus, which causes severe bleeding and organ failure and is spread through contact with body fluids, has alarmed governments in the region and international health organisations, concerned that a major outbreak could overwhelm health infrastructures already battling a pandemic.
""The last time Guinea faced an Ebola outbreak, vaccines were still being developed,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in the statement. ""With the experience and expertise it has built up, combined with safe and effective vaccines, Guinea has the tools and the know-how to respond to this outbreak."" 
Guinea has recorded four confirmed and four probable cases, including five deaths, in the first resurgence of Ebola since the 2013-2016 outbreak that killed 11,300 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The WHO said in the statement that genome sequencing is underway in Senegal’s Institute Pasteur to identify the strain of the Ebola virus.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India said on Tuesday mutated versions of coronavirus were not responsible for an upsurge in cases in two states, a potential relief for a country where mask-wearing and social distancing have largely disappeared.
Maharashtra in the west and Kerala in the south account for 75% of India's current active cases of about 147,000, and both states have seen a sudden rise in new infections in recent days, fuelling calls for a faster roll-out of vaccines.
India has reported more than 11 million cases - the most in the world after the United States - and about 156,000 deaths. Actual infections have inched closer to 300 million in the country of 1.35 billion people, according to a random study of antibodies done by the government.
A top government health official confirmed the long-time presence of two mutants - N440K and E484Q - in those two states as well as elsewhere in the country and abroad. Authorities have also found the UK variant in 187 people in India, the South African one in six and one case of the Brazilian mutation.
""There is no reason today for us to believe, on the basis of scientific information, that these are responsible for the upsurge of the outbreak,"" Vinod Kumar Paul, who heads a government committee on vaccines, told a news conference.
""We are constantly watching the behaviour of mutations in our country.""
Though cases have come down sharply since a September peak, Paul said India was still vulnerable, especially given that even previously badly affected cities like Pune in Maharashtra were getting hit again. He urged people to wear masks and avoid social events - guidelines openly flouted by both federal and state ministers.
The northern state of Punjab, which has also seen a rise in cases, said indoor gatherings would be restricted to 100 and outdoor to 200 from March 1. District heads have also been permitted to decide on night curfews in hotspots, and testing will be increased, the state's chief minister said on Twitter.
Punjab is one of the worst performing states in vaccinating their healthcare workers, according to the federal government.
India has given nearly 12 million doses to its health and frontline workers since beginning the campaign in mid-January, a pace that will have to be increased sharply to meet the target of reaching 300 million people by August.
Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said India would very soon start immunising people over 50 and those with medical conditions, with greater involvement from private hospitals. Government hospitals are now running around 80% of vaccination sites.
The government has recently come under pressure to expand coverage at home given the world's largest vaccine maker has exported COVID-19 shots to more than two dozen countries.

India is using a vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech and the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research, and another licensed from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University. Other vaccines are in the queue, including Russia's Sputnik V and products from Cadila Healthcare and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX).

1633,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 10:05AM ET</span>",Indian judge sees no reason to detain climate activist charged with sedition,"By Suchitra Mohanty and Zeba Siddiqui
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A New Delhi court on Tuesday granted bail to 22-year-old climate activist, saying there was ""scanty and sketchy evidence"" of sedition in her efforts to help farmers protest in a case that has drawn global attention. 
Disha Ravi was arrested in the southern city of Bengaluru on Feb. 13 and charged with sedition for her alleged role in the creation of an online toolkit that police said contained action plans used to foment violence during the farmers' protest.
Tens of thousands have been camped out on the outskirts of New Delhi in bitter cold since December to protest new agricultural laws they say will hurt them to the benefit of large corporations. The government says the reforms will bring new investment in the vast and antiquated produce markets.
Judge Dharmender Rana said there was little to hold Ravi, a founder of the local chapter of Swedish climate crusader Greta Thunberg's movement, in custody any longer and criticised the authorities for detaining anyone who differed with government policy.
""Considering the scanty and sketchy evidence available on record, I do not find any palpable reasons to breach the general rule of ‘Bail’ against a 22-year-old young lady, with absolutely blemish free criminal antecedents and having firm roots in the society, and send her to jail,"" Rana said in a written order.
Her arrest stoked criticism of repression of dissent by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government which has been trying for months to end the farmers protest. 
Ravi's lawyers had said there was nothing in the toolkit to attract the charge of sedition, which carries a life term. 
""Perusal of the said 'Toolkit' reveals that any call for any kind of violence is conspicuously absent,"" the judge said in a written order.
The protests present one of the biggest challenges to Modi's rule. Several rounds of talks between the farmers and his government have failed, and Modi has faced criticism for using heavy-handed tactics to curb the movement. 
Police had alleged that the toolkit was authored by Ravi and two others, and had the backing of supporters of a Canadian-based group called the Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF). They also said Ravi had shared the toolkit with Thunberg, who is one of several international celebrities who have lent public support to the farmers' cause. 
The judge said he did not find Ravi's link to the toolkit or PFJ objectionable.
PJF founder Mo Dhaliwal told Reuters: ""We didn’t assemble the toolkit in question, although links to our materials were included in that document.""
Dhaliwal also countered the police's claim that the PFJ was a separatist outfit.

""We have only created space for open debate and dialogue,"" he said, alleging it was being targeted because Modi's government was ""fostering a culture of fear where dissent is equated with sedition"".

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal's top court on Tuesday ordered the reinstatement of parliament, dealing a blow to Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli two months after he dissolved the house and called for an early election amid squabbling within the ruling Communist party.
The ruling means Oli, who was elected in 2018 following his party’s landslide win in an election in 2017, faces a no-confidence vote once parliament re-sits.
The Himalayan nation has been in political turmoil since December when Oli, who turned 69 on Tuesday, made a sudden decision to call elections 18 months ahead of schedule amid the coronavirus pandemic that has hit the tourism-dependent economy hard.
""The recommendation for the dissolution of the House of Representatives and the notice dissolving Parliament have been rejected by the honourable judges,"" Bhadrakali Pokharel, a court official, told Reuters.
Judges heard more than a dozen petitions challenging Oli's move as unconstitutional and seeking the reinstatement of the house, which still had two years to run when it was dissolved. 
Oli had defended his move, saying his rivals in the Nepal Communist Party had not cooperated with the government in the appointment of officials to panels such as the national human rights and anti-corruption commissions, and in other policy decisions. 
But judges rejected this and ordered that parliament be convened within 13 days.
""The House of Representatives is reinstated as it is able and competent to perform its work,"" the court said.
About 100 slogan-shouting activists, their faces smeared in vermillion, lit candles on the street in the heart of Kathmandu to celebrate the verdict and urged Oli to quit.
The verdict was welcomed by opposition parties and opponents from his own party who have launched street protests across the country since the dissolution.
""This is a victory of the constitution and the Supreme Court has fulfilled the popular aspiration for justice by restoring the parliament,"" said Pampha Bhusal, a senior leader of the Nepal Communist Party.
Oli and his aides were not immediately available for comment but his lawyers said they would honour the ruling.

""We respect the court and honour the verdict. The parliament will sit within 13 days as ordered by the court,"" Ramesh Badal, one of Oli's lawyers, told Reuters.

Vince Muscat changed his plea from not guilty during pre-trial compilation of evidence. He has been under arrest since December 2017 when, together with another two men, he was accused of having planned and executed the murder. The other two are sticking to their not-guilty plea. 
Caruana Galizia's killing by a car bomb shone a spotlight on corruption in the European Union's smallest nation. 
A fourth person, multimillionaire businessman Yorgen Fenech who had high-level political connections, is suspected of having masterminded the crime and has been accused of being an accomplice to murder. He has denied wrongdoing. 
The self-confessed middleman in the plot, Melvin Theuma, turned state evidence in 2019 in return for a pardon. 
Muscat's request for a similar deal was denied last month, but a legal source said he had been offered a reduced sentence as part of a plea bargain.
No official information about the deal has been given and lawyers agreed on Tuesday that submissions about punishment will take place behind closed doors.

Muscat is not related to Joseph Muscat, the former prime minister who was in office when Caruana Galizia was killed and resigned in December 2019 to ""shoulder political responsibility"". Fenech was close friends with the former premier's chief of staff Keith Schembri, who has denied any wrongdoing and any knowledge of the murder or its perpetrators.

""While we are carrying out scientific work, harassment is not appropriate, it is not befitting of good neighbourly ties,"" he told reporters in parliament.
A Greek defence ministry official denied the accusations, saying ""Greek jets never harassed the Turkish vessel.""
After a five-year hiatus, Turkish and Greek officials met on Jan. 25 to discuss a decades-old dispute over the delimitation of maritime zones and rights to energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean. The allies have agreed to meet again in Athens.

Athens said it has sent an invitation to Ankara suggesting the talks resume in early March, ahead of an EU summit. Ankara has said it wants to continue talks and improve ties with the EU, which backs Greece in the dispute.

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - An Italian military plane arrived in eastern Congo on Tuesday to bring home the bodies of its ambassador and his bodyguard, who were shot dead in an ambush on a United Nations convoy, while the militia accused of killing them denied any involvement. 
Ambassador Luca Attanasio, 43, and his bodyguard Vittorio Iacovacci, 30, were killed on Monday while travelling in a World Food Programme convoy to visit a school feeding project. WFP driver Mustapha Milambo was also killed.
In the eastern city of Goma, a U.N. van transported Attanasio and Iacovacci's bodies to the airport, where the Italian cargo plane had landed early in the afternoon. The bodies were due to be flown to Rome. 
Democratic Republic of Congo's interior ministry on Monday blamed a Hutu militia called the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), but did not provide any evidence. 
The FDLR was founded by senior Rwandan officers and militiamen who the United Nations and others have said helped orchestrate the 1994 genocide in neighbouring Rwanda. It is one of around 120 armed groups operating in eastern Congo.
""The FDLR declare that they are in no way involved in the attack,"" the rebel group said in a statement, condemning what it called a ""cowardly assassination"".
Congo's presidency said on Tuesday that President Felix Tshisekedi had dispatched his top diplomatic adviser to Goma to support an investigation by local authorities. 
A Congolese envoy in Rome was also expected on Tuesday to present a personal letter from Tshisekedi to Italian President Sergio Mattarella, Congo's presidency said. 
'FINAL JOURNEY' 
In an interview, Dario Tedesco, an Italian volcanologist based in Goma, paid tribute to his friend Attanasio.
""He was able to talk to all of us, completely different because, he was adapting himself to each of us, (making) us feeling we were important,"" Tedesco said. ""He believed in what he was doing and this shouldn’t have been his final journey.""
The FDLR has been blamed for previous kidnappings in the area, including of two British tourists in May 2018. The tourists were held for several days before being freed. 
Monday's ambush was carried out by six armed men, who stopped the two-car convoy on the road north from Goma, the presidency said.
    The attackers led the seven passengers away from the cars after killing one of the drivers.
    Army and park rangers tracked the group and a firefight ensued.

    ""The kidnappers fired point-blank shots at the bodyguard who died on the spot and at the ambassador, wounding him in the abdomen. The ambassador died of his wounds an hour later at the United Nations peacekeeping hospital in Goma,"" the presidency said.

The Netanyahu government has decided to avoid public spats with U.S. President Joe Biden over his desire to return to a 2015 Iran nuclear deal, but that approach could change depending on the actions of the Biden administration, Army Radio added.
Netanyahu's office declined comment.
The conservative premier is seeking a fifth term in a March 23 election. Unlike previous campaigns, he has not played up foreign policy - reflecting perhaps a change of fortune since Biden, a Democrat, succeeded Republican president Donald Trump, a vocal ally of Netanyahu.
On Monday, Netanyahu held a first meeting about Iran with Defence Minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, his centrist political rivals, in what officials said was an effort to present a united Israeli front.
Under the 2015 deal with world powers, Iran agreed to limit its enrichment potential - a possible pathway to atomic bombs - in exchange for a lifting of most sanctions. Netanyahu upset then-U.S. President Barack Obama, whom Biden served as vice president, by addressing Congress as part of vigorous advocacy against the deal. 
Trump quit the deal in 2018, deeming it one-sided in Iran's favour. Iran began breaching the deal the 2019 and has recently stepped up violations.
The Biden administration announced on Thursday that it was ready to talk to Tehran about a mutual return to compliance with the agreement. A person familiar with the matter said Israel was informed in advance.
Israel said in a statement on Friday it was ""in close contact"" with Washington on the issue and asserted that a return to the 2015 deal would ""pave Iran's path to a nuclear arsenal"". 
Israel is reputed to have the Middle East’s only atomic arsenal but neither confirms nor denies this under a ""strategic ambiguity"" policy to deter Arab and Iranian adversaries.

Tehran, which denies seeking the bomb, has so far been cool to the the Biden administration's overture.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian government will be back in court on Tuesday defending its agreement with the United States to turn back asylum-seekers in an effort to overturn a federal court decision that found the pact violated Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
A victory for the government would mean asylum-seekers would continue to be turned back at the Canadian border under conditions a court found violated their rights. A loss would force Ottawa to rethink refugee management at the world's longest undefended border.
Under the Safe Third Country Agreement, signed in 2002, asylum-seekers trying to enter one country through a land border crossing are turned back on the basis they should make their claim in the first safe country in which they arrived.
Last year, a Canadian federal judge found the treaty violates individuals' right to life, liberty and the security of the person in part because of the likelihood people turned back to the United States would be detained, and also due to the conditions under which they would be detained.
In its written submission ahead of Tuesday's hearing, the Canadian government argued the federal court failed to take into account not only U.S. safeguards of people subject to detention but Canada's monitoring of U.S. detention practices.
The laws in question do not require Canadian officials to turn back individuals in circumstances that would ""shock the conscience"" of Canadians, the submission reads.
The Canadian government has indicated it wants to expand the agreement to cover the whole border, not just formal ports of entry.
During former U.S. President Donald Trump's term in office, tens of thousands of asylum seekers crossed the Canada-U.S. border in between formal border crossings to skirt the agreement.
President Joe Biden has pursued a more immigrant-friendly agenda in his first weeks in office. But Canada cannot use that to argue for the United States as a safe country because an appeal has to deal with what is already on the record.
The argument defending U.S. immigration detention ""flies in the face of [Canada's] public persona as a refugee-welcoming country that purports to support humanitarian endeavours around the world,"" said Jamie Chai Yun Liew, a law professor at the University of Ottawa with a focus on immigration law.
And problematic U.S. practices were not specific to Trump, Liew said. 

Hearings are scheduled to take place in the Federal Court of Appeal on Tuesday and Wednesday.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines will let thousands of its healthcare workers, mostly nurses, take up jobs in Britain and Germany if the two countries agree to donate much-needed coronavirus vaccines, a senior official said on Tuesday.
The Philippines, which has among Asia's highest number of coronavirus cases, has relaxed a ban on deploying its healthcare workers overseas, but still limits the number of medical professionals leaving the country to 5,000 a year.
Alice Visperas, director of the labour ministry's international affairs bureau, said the Philippines was open to lifting the cap in exchange for vaccines from Britain and Germany, which it would use to inoculate outbound workers and hundreds of thousands of Filipino repatriates.
Nurses are among the millions of Filipinos who work overseas, providing in excess of $30 billion a year in remittances vital to the country's economy.
""We are considering the request to lift the deployment cap, subject to agreement,"" Visperas told Reuters.
Britain is grappling with the world's sixth-highest coronavirus death toll and one of the worst economic hits from the pandemic, while Germany has the 10th most infections globally.
While the two countries have inoculated a combined 23 million people, the Philippines has yet to start its campaign to immunise 70 million adults, or two-thirds of its 108 million people. It expects to receive its first batch of vaccines this week, donated by China.
The Philippines wants to secure 148 million doses of vaccines altogether.
The British embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment while calls to Germany's mission went unanswered.
In 2019, almost 17,000 Filipino nurses signed overseas work contracts, government data showed.
While Filipino nurses have fought to lift the deployment ban to escape poor working conditions and low pay at home, the workers-for-vaccine plan has not gone down well with some medical workers.

""We are disgusted on how nurses and healthcare workers are being treated by the government as commodities or export products,"" Jocelyn Andamo, secretary general of the Filipino Nurses United, told Reuters.

Zuma stands accused of rampant corruption during his tenure as deputy president from 1999 and later as president from 2009 to 2018, although he denies any wrongdoing. 
The arms deal allegations relate to his time as deputy president and he is being tried on 16 charges of racketeering, fraud, corruption and money laundering in connection with French defence firm Thales. 
Zuma is accused of accepting 500,000 rand ($34,000) annually from Thales from 1999 as a bribe, in exchange for protecting the company from an investigation into a deal to supply military hardware to South Africa.
He denied the charges at a previous hearing. Thales, known as Thompson-CSF in 1999, has consistently said it has no knowledge of any transgressions having been committed by any of its employees in relation to the awarding of the contracts.
The pre-trial hearing, which was broadcast on local television, began on Tuesday after it was postponed in December.
Zuma was not present for the hearing.
The case is ready to go to trial, the Pietermaritzburg High Court said, and asked all accused to be present on May 17 provided COVID-19 restrictions allow representatives of the French company to fly to the country.
The trial will last from May until June, the court said.

In another case, a South African inquiry into corruption during Zuma's time as president is seeking his imprisonment for two years, after he defied an order from the country's top court to appear and give evidence.

1642,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 05:26AM ET</span>","Obituary: Yamani, the Saudi oil minister who brought the West to its knees","By Rania El Gamal
DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Sheikh Zaki Yamani, the embodiment of the ascent of Arab petroleum power and the face of the 1973 oil embargo that brought the West to its knees, has died. 
Yamani was a witness to the 1975 murder of the Saudi king who had plucked him, a non-royal, from obscurity to be oil minister. Later the same year Yamani was kidnapped at an OPEC meeting by Ilyich Ramirez Sanchez, known as Carlos the Jackal.
Yamani, 91, died in London, Saudi state media reported on Tuesday. 
Known for his elegant manner and trademark goatee beard, Yamani's 24-year tenure running the oil affairs of the world's biggest crude producer made him a global celebrity during the inflationary ""oil shocks"" of the 1970s. 
That ended with his abrupt sacking in 1986 after a costly attempt to prop up crude prices, a failed strategy which has cast a shadow over Saudi oil policy to this day. 
In December 1975, Yamani attended the meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Vienna, which ended in a hail of bullets fired into the ceiling from Venezuelan assassin Carlos and five cohorts. Three bystanders were killed.
Carlos, promoting the Palestinian cause, targeted Yamani as the most valuable hostage, telling him repeatedly that he had been sentenced to death. Ministers were held for two days in a dynamite-charged room before the captors were granted a plane out of Austria with their hostages.
A further 43 harrowing hours on board, flying from Algeria to Libya and back, created an intimacy between captive and hostage taker.
""It was odd, but as we sat together and talked, it was almost as if we had become friends,"" Yamani told biographer Jeffrey Robinson. ""He was telling me so much, knowing that I would die."" 
A deal was struck in Algiers and Carlos vanished, escaping arrest until 1994. 
Months earlier, Yamani was at the side of Saudi King Faisal in Riyadh, receiving a visiting delegation when a disaffected Saudi prince pulled out a revolver and shot the king dead. 
COMMONER AMONG ROYALS
Yamani's career was remarkable, for the time, as a commoner in a society dominated by the royal family.
Born on June 30, 1930, the son of an Islamic scholar and judge in Mecca, Yamani was expected to follow his father and grandfather into teaching.
After studying law in Cairo he left for New York University and Harvard. Returning to Saudi Arabia, he set up a law firm and took on government work, drawing the attention of the future King Faisal. He became oil minister in 1962.
Yamani became a leading figure in the development of OPEC, founded in 1960. He extricated the Saudi oil industry from the grip of American companies in a series of steps that produced a deal on national ownership of  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) in 1976.
Aramco remains among the world's wealthiest companies by assets.
In Yamani's early years as oil minister, Arab nationalism was on the rise and oil power was at the heart of it. 
By the time of the 1967 Arab-Israeli Six-Day War, Riyadh was ready to flex its economic muscle. Yamani announced a supply embargo against countries friendly to Israel. But the embargo did not bite. High inventories in the West and extra supply from Venezuela and pre-revolutionary Iran filled the gap. 
In 1973 the fourth Arab-Israeli conflict prompted Yamani to trigger another oil embargo. This time it worked - a fourfold increase in the price of crude marked the high point of OPEC power and sent western economies into recession as inflation soared in what became known as the first oil shock.
OIL MASTERS
Yamani summed up that moment when oil producers took charge. ""The moment has come,"" he said. ""We are masters of our own commodity.""
With the end of the war and the embargo, Riyadh found an accommodation with the United States. 
Yamani was now a price moderate, espousing the view that high prices would ultimately destroy demand and encourage production from new exploration in places such as the North Sea.
When the 1979 Iranian revolution triggered a second oil shock in the West, most in OPEC raised oil prices. Riyadh, close now to Washington, issued the ""Yamani Edict"", holding Saudi prices at official levels to ease the pain for importers. 
Yamani's new-found price moderation was to cost him. A supply glut born of the early 1980s recession in the West depressed fuel demand. 
Faisal's successor, King Fahd, called on Yamani to both protect Saudi market share and boost prices. Instead, he cut Saudi production to a 20-year low of only 2 million barrels per day in an effort to shore up prices.
Fellow OPEC members were not as disciplined on production and Yamani was criticised at home as others increased their market share at Riyadh's expense. As the oil glut ballooned, crude prices crashed below $10 a barrel.
Having disobeyed Fahd and failed, Yamani paid the price. In October 1986 he learned of his dismissal from a public announcement on Saudi television, apparently designed to embarrass him.
Yamani retreated to his private life and became the figurehead for a consultancy, the Centre for Global Energy Studies. At its launch in London in 1989, with crude still worth only $20 a barrel, he predicted prices would eventually break $100, as they did eventually in the new millennium.
Reuters interviewed Yamani in September 2000 to mark OPEC's 40th anniversary. Shale oil was little known at the time and renewables were in their infancy, but Yamani predicted that technology would hurt oil producers.
“Technology is a real enemy for OPEC,” he said. “Technology will reduce consumption and increase production from areas outside OPEC. The real victims will be Saudi Arabia, with huge reserves which they can do nothing with.

PARIS (Reuters) - Avian influenza in Europe is now approaching levels last seen in 2016 with egg supply shrinking in Poland, one of the hardest hit countries due to the loss of laying hens, in a sign that the virus is starting to strain the poultry industry. 
The disease, commonly called bird flu, has been found in several European countries, decimating flocks with bruising losses for farmers already hit hard by Covid-19.
Asia is also experiencing outbreaks of the same highly pathogenic H5N8 strain as the livestock sector also reels from the deadly African Swine Fever epidemic. 
Russia said over the weekend it has registered the first case of A(H5N8) bird flu being passed to humans from birds in seven workers at a poultry plant, raising concern that the virus could mutate into a human-to-human disease. 
The disease tends to start in autumn, carried by migrating wild birds on their way from Asia to Europe.
""The number of outbreaks has surged even more than in difficult years,"" Monique Eloit, head of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), told Reuters.
Around 5 million birds have already been culled in Poland, the European Union's largest poultry producer, data from the local chief veterinary inspectorate showed.
The total represents a small fraction of the EU's poultry flock and there is no sign yet of any shortage of chicken.
There were 6.4 billion chickens slaughtered for meat in the EU-27 in 2019, according to statistics issued by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
The loss of laying hens has, however, reduced the supply of eggs and put some upward pressure on prices.
Prices for eggs on the wholesale market in Poland jumped by about 18% to 20% at the end of January, said Katarzyna Gawronska, the director of the National Chamber of Poultry and Feed Producers.
    Data issued by the European Commission show egg prices are also rising in several other EU countries, including France and Germany, although they remain weak in another major producing country, Spain.
    ""Taking into account the losses in poultry in Poland and throughout Europe, the egg market has recently experienced a sharp price spike - these prices were dormant earlier,"" Gawronska said.
Poland produced 648,000 tonnes of eggs in 2019, making it the European Union's sixth largest egg producer, EU data showed.
German farmers were fearful of export bans on their eggs.
Florian Anthes, spokesman for German poultry farming and industry association ZDG, said there was concern about the prospect of export curbs as keeping hens indoors for long periods to avoid the disease would hit marketability of free-range eggs.
In 2019, prior to the COVID-19 epidemic, Germany exported about 1.7 billion eggs worth about 300 million euros mostly to the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland and Austria, figures from German agricultural agency BLE showed.
In France, bird flu had mainly hit duck farms in the southwest that supply the foie gras industry. 
But the bird flu crisis there has slowed in the past weeks after 3 million birds were culled due to the disease, the farm ministry said. That represents about 3.5% of the total number of ducks slaughtered each year in France.
Other countries including Sweden and Germany have had to destroy large flocks to prevent the virus spreading.Bird flu outbreaks, like other animal diseases, often trigger trade restrictions.
That prospect forced some producers, including France's largest poultry group LDC, to recall exports which were already on their way to China.
However, importing countries' increasing approach to limit restrictions to those regions affected by the virus were seen softening the impact.

To combat the disease farmers are ordered to ensure that nets to keep out wild birds are installed properly, to disinfect facilities and check hygiene regimes.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - United Arab Emirates' state-owned weapons maker EDGE expects to be involved in the supply chain of  Lockheed Martin 's F-35 war plane if the sale of U.S. planes to the Gulf Arab state goes ahead, its chief executive said on Tuesday.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is re-examining the sale of 50 F-35 stealth jets, 18 armed drones and other military equipment approved by former President Donald Trump during his last days in office.
""Any platform that is coming to the country, we are now getting heavily involved in this supply chain in whatever component that makes sense for the client and for us,"" EDGE CEO Faisal al-Bannai said at Abu Dhabi's Idex defence exhibition.
EDGE, a $5 billion state defence conglomerate, could integrate subsystems, products and weapons, perform maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) work and also develop weapons such as missiles for the jet, he said.
The Gulf state, one of Washington’s closest Middle Eastern allies, was promised a chance to buy the war planes when it established formal ties with Israel last year.
EDGE was in ""advanced discussion"" with several Israeli defence companies about jointly funding and developing missiles and unmanned platforms, Bannai said without identifying the firms.
""Quite soon there will be announcements,"" he said.
It is not clear when Washington will complete its review, though even if approved the first F-35 is not expected to be delivered for several years.
""Every country has their own process. I think they will go through their process and come to what is a right decision for them,"" Bannai said of the U.S. review.
The UAE's Ambassador to Washington Yousef al-Otaiba has said he is confident the sale would go through.
The jets are a major component of a $23 billion sale of high-tech armaments from General Atomics, Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp to the UAE.
The F-35, the world's most advanced war plane, would give the UAE a ""huge deterrence capability"" against regional foe Iran, an Arab diplomat in the Gulf told Reuters. 
""The F-35 gives a lot of control over the Gulf skies. It's a big thing. It's a game changer for the UAE,"" the diplomat said. 
EDGE, tasked with supplying advanced weapons to the UAE armed forces, is focused on developing drones, unmanned vehicles, smart weapons and electronic warfare equipment rather than conventional weaponry.
""We are a small country in size and population ... we are extremely focused on deploying more smarter technology that can apply a 'force multiplier' to our army,"" Bannai said. 
EDGE is developing a directed energy system, to be unveiled next year, that can be used against aerial and land threats. 

EDGE announced on Tuesday it would supply Rheinmetall's Oerlikon Skynex air defence system with a short-range interceptor missile system known as SkyKnight.

High Court judge Anthea Pang rejected Lai's latest application last week but only made public the reasons for her decision on Tuesday.
The case is being closely watched as it shows how Hong Kong's independent judiciary resolves any conflicts between the security law drafted in Beijing - where courts come under the Communist Party - and the city's common law traditions.
The new law puts the onus on the defendant to prove they would not be a national security threat if released on bail. Under Hong Kong's common law-based legal system, the onus has traditionally been on the prosecution to prove its case.
""If one was determined, the foreseeable danger of being discovered might not be a bar to action,"" Pang's written judgement said.
""I am not satisfied that there are sufficient grounds for believing that the Applicant will not continue to commit acts endangering national security if bail is granted to him."" 
Lai was arrested in August on suspicion of collusion with foreign forces when about 200 police officers raided the newsroom of his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily tabloid newspaper. He was arrested again last week, while in jail, on suspicion of assisting a fugitive China captured at sea last year.
Beijing imposed the national security law on the former British colony last June after months of pro-democracy protests. The law punishes anything China considers subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Critics say it is aimed at crushing dissent and it erodes freedoms in the semi-autonomous financial hub. Its supporters say it restores stability after months of unrest.
Prosecutors have accused Lai of breaching the law over statements he made on July 30 and Aug. 18, in which they allege he requested foreign interference in Hong Kong's affairs.

Lai has been a frequent visitor to Washington, meeting with officials, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a ""traitor"".

LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Philip, the 99-year-old husband of Britain's Queen Elizabeth, has spent a seventh night in hospital after being admitted as a precaution.
Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, walked into London's private King Edward VII Hospital last Tuesday evening after he was advised by his doctor to be admitted after he felt unwell.
Buckingham Palace have said he was expected to remain at the hospital for a few days for observation and his 94-year-old wife has stayed at Windsor Castle, her home to the west of London where the couple have been during the COVID-19 lockdown.
Both royals have received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine and the Duke's illness is not related to COVID. A royal source has said it was expected he would remain in hospital into this week and Philip was in good spirits.
Prince William, son of heir Prince Charles, said on Monday his grandfather was ""OK, they're keeping an eye on him"".
Philip's illness comes at a tricky time for the queen and the monarchy after it was announced last week that William's younger brother Prince Harry and his American wife Meghan would be severing all their official royal links.
Harry, 36, and Meghan, 39, stepped down from duties in March last year, and that split was formalised on Friday, with the couple losing their treasured royal patronages.
They have moved with their son Archie to Southern California to live a more independent life and escape the British media, and next month will give a ""wide-ranging"" interview to U.S. chat show host Oprah Winfrey.
The hospitalisation of Philip, who has been the queen's confidante throughout her 69-year reign and the patriarch of the family, deprives the monarch of his counsel. 

However, the prince has taken more of a back seat since he retired from public life in 2017, with many of his official roles being taken on by other members of the family.

KABUL (Reuters) - Civilian casualties in Afghanistan escalated sharply after peace talks began last year, the United Nations said in a report released on Tuesday, calling for a ceasefire as negotiators met for the first time after weeks of inaction. 
U.S.-brokered peace talks began in September but progress has since slowed and violence has risen with uncertainty over whether international forces will pull out troops by May as originally planned. 
Civilian casualties were 8,820 in 2020, according to the United Nations' mission to Afghanistan's (UNAMA) annual report. That was 15% lower than the previous year, but the report's authors noted with alarm a sharp uptick and historically high civilian casualties in the final three months of 2020, when peace talks began.
Last year ""could have been the year of peace in Afghanistan. Instead, thousands of Afghan civilians perished,"" said Deborah Lyons, head of UNAMA, reiterating calls for a ceasefire which has been repeatedly rejected by the Taliban. ""Parties refusing to consider a ceasefire must recognise the devastating consequences.""
The Taliban on Tuesday issued a response critical of the report, saying ""the concerns, precise information and accurate details that were shared by us have not been taken into account.""
The report said that for the first time since records began, deaths and injuries had escalated in the final three months of the year from the previous three months. Casualties for the fourth quarter were up 45% compared with the same period in 2019. 
The majority of were ascribed to non-government actors, predominately the insurgent Taliban, and more than one-fifth were attributed to government forces.
A government spokesman did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Both sides said on Twitter their chief negotiators met in Doha, the venue for talks, on Monday evening, adding that teams would continue work on an agenda.
After a monthlong break over the new year period, negotiators returned to Doha briefly before many senior members of the Taliban left to hold meetings in Russia and Iran. Mujahid said they would hold further meetings soon. 

Zabihullah said that the lull was only a break and the Taliban were committed to talks, with further meetings expected in coming days.

Melia, chairman of the United National Movement (UNM) opposition party, had been accused of inciting violence at street protests in June 2019, a charge he has dismissed as politically motivated.
A court in the capital Tbilisi ordered last week that he be taken into custody for allegedly failing to post bail. The Interior Ministry at the time announced it was postponing carrying out the order to detain Melia following the resignation of Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia. 
Footage from inside UNM offices published by the Sputnik Georgia outlet showed Melia barricaded inside a room with some of his supporters, while opposition activists clashed with police on the street.
""We call on both the representatives of political parties and their supporters to protest in a peaceful manner, to refrain from violent actions and not interfere with the court's decision,"" Sputnik Georgia quoted the Interior Ministry as saying, referring to the order to have Melia detained.
Gakharia, who stepped down on Feb. 18, said his decision had been prompted by a disagreement with his own team over the order to detain Melia.

Gakharia had said that Melia's detention was unacceptable if it threatened to fuel political divisions in the South Caucasus country of 3.7 million people.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The arrest on drug trafficking charges of Emma Coronel Aispuro, a former beauty queen and wife of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, follows a telenovela-style life that straddled hyper-violent Mexican cartels, fame and motherhood.
Coronel, 31, married young into infamy and had a front-row seat to Guzman's high-stakes cat-and-mouse game with Mexican and U.S. agents hunting him down. 
A U.S.-Mexican dual national, Coronel was arrested on Monday at Dulles International Airport and is due to appear in a U.S. District of Columbia court on Tuesday charged with distributing cocaine, heroin and other drugs.
Coronel caught the attention of Guzman, who is more than three decades her senior, when she was a teenaged beauty queen. 
They married after she turned 18 in 2007 and had twin daughters, spending their entire married life with Guzman either in jail or on the run as the leader of the powerful Sinaloa cartel. Guzman is serving a life sentence in a U.S. jail.
Coronel's fame soared during Guzman's 2019 trial in New York, where she became a media sensation with her designer outfits and the loyalty she showed her husband - even as prosecutors detailed how he kept a string of lovers.
She even became a key character in the court drama when a former lieutenant of Guzman's alleged Coronel played a pivotal role in her husband's Hollywood-style escape from prison in a mile-long tunnel burrowed under his jail cell's shower in 2015.
Piggybacking on her husband's fame and seeking to cash-in on her celebrity outside Mexico, Coronel launched a clothing brand in the United States in 2019 and even appeared in a U.S. reality show about mafia families.
""I consider myself a normal woman,"" Coronel said in VH1's Cartel Crew show, speaking aboard a yacht. 
""It's sad that they judge us without knowing us. It's hard.""
In media interviews, Coronel emphasised her enduring loyalty to Guzman and her focus on bringing up their twin daughters. 
""Emma is like the old narco families in Sinaloa,"" a former acquaintance told Reuters.
'LOVE STORY'
Steeped in the narco tradition from an early age, Coronel was raised in the mountains of Durango, part of Mexico's ""Golden Triangle"" of drug trafficking states that includes Sinaloa. Her father was jailed for trafficking drugs in 2017.
Coronel first hit the headlines in Mexico after her 2007 church wedding in rural Durango to Guzman, who at the time was on the run from authorities. 
Coronel would be by Guzman's side during several near-misses as Mexican police and U.S. agents tracked him.
At Guzman's trial, his former right-hand man, Damaso Lopez Nuñez, testified how Coronel, along with Guzman's sons, helped orchestrate the audacious 2015 prison escape.
They got a plot of land near the prison, arranged weapons, brought an armoured truck and even had a GPS wristwatch smuggled into Guzman's cell so the tunnel engineers would have exact jail cell coordinates to help their digging, according to testimony.
Guzman was captured again in 2016 and extradited to the United States in 2017. 
At Guzman's trial, whenever he entered the court, he would seek Coronel out and wave. They could not speak to each other but their glances caught the attention of the media.
""It was like a love story in complete silence as she wasn't allowed to say anything,"" said journalist Miguel Angel Vega of the Riodoce newspaper in Sinaloa who covered the trial.
""It's quite interesting to see what's happening in this new case,"" Vega said. ""It's like a soap opera.""

WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The wife of Mexican drug cartel boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman was arrested and charged in the United States on Monday with helping her husband continue to run his drug trafficking cartel while he was behind bars.
Emma Coronel Aispuro, 31, a regular attendee at her husband's high-profile U.S. trial two years ago where he was convicted of trafficking tons of drugs into the United States, was arrested at Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia.
Her arrest is the highest profile U.S. capture of a Mexican on drug charges since former Mexican Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos was detained in October, and experts said it indicated a deterioration in bilateral security relations. 
Coronel was charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with conspiring to distribute heroin, cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamines for unlawful importation into the United States. She is expected to appear in a federal court in Washington on Tuesday.
An affidavit attached to the charges also details Coronel's alleged involvement in her husband's escape from a Mexican prison in 2015 and a second attempted prison break in 2016 before the 63-year-old was extradited to the United States.
A lawyer for Coronel could not immediately be identified, and lawyers in Mexico linked to the Guzman family did not respond to a request for comment.
A Mexican official familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified, said Coronel's arrest appeared to be solely a U.S. initiative and that Coronel was not wanted in Mexico.
""[It's] a sign of what's likely ahead,"" former Mexican ambassador to the United States Arturo Sarukhan said, describing it as an example of U.S. agencies acting with little coordination with Mexican counterparts.
Joint efforts to fight drug trafficking were strained by Cienfuegos' arrest, with Mexico's government moving to restrict U.S. agents' activities in Mexico in retaliation for what it called a breach of trust. 
The Justice Department unexpectedly dropped the Cienfuegos case the following month and let him return to Mexico, a move Mexico welcomed as restoring trust between the two countries. Two months later, Mexico dropped its own case against Cienfuegos.
The investigation into Coronel was handled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), rather than the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The charges relate to alleged trafficking activity between 2014-2107 prior to the high-profile Brooklyn trial where Guzman was convicted on drug trafficking offenses.
The indictment documents said Coronel relayed messages on behalf of Guzman to facilitate drug trafficking after his arrest in 2014.
Prosecutors said Coronel also conspired to aid her husband in his July 2015 escape from the Altiplano prison in Mexico through a mile-long tunnel from his cell. An unnamed cooperating witness was paid $1 million to help facilitate a failed second escape a year later, according to the affidavit.
POTENTIAL PRESSURE STRATEGY
Coronel, who married Guzman as an 18-year-old beauty queen in 2017, is a dual U.S.-Mexico citizen who lives in Mexico. It was unclear why she was in the Washington area at the time of her arrest.
Prosecutors at Guzman's trial two years ago said he amassed power through murders and wars with rival cartels. Guzman was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years, which the sentencing judge said reflected Guzman's ""overwhelmingly evil"" actions. Guzman was sent to ADX Florence in Colorado, the nation's most secure ""Supermax"" prison.

Tomas Guevara, an investigator in security issues at the Autonomous University of Sinaloa, said Coronel's arrest might be part of a ""pressure strategy"" to prompt cooperation from Guzman.

The 1,200 detainees are scheduled to leave on Tuesday afternoon in three navy ships sent by Myanmar's military, which seized power in a Feb. 1 coup, sparking weeks of protests from pro-democracy activists.
Refugee groups say asylum seekers from the minority Chin, Kachin and non-Rohingya Muslim communities fleeing conflict and persecution at home are among those being deported.
Malaysia has said it would not deport Rohingya Muslims or refugees registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
The UN refugee agency has said there are at least six people registered with it that are also set to be deported and that there could be more. It has not been allowed access to the deportees.
Buses and immigration department trucks were seen taking the detainees to the western Malaysian port of Lumut, where the Myanmar ships are docked at a naval base.
Rights groups Amnesty International and Asylum Access sought a court order on Monday to stop the deportation, saying three people registered with UNHCR and 17 minors who have at least one parent in Malaysia were among the deportees. 
""If Malaysia insists on sending back the 1,200 individuals, it would be responsible for putting them at risk of further persecution, violence and even death,"" Katrina Maliamauv, Amnesty Malaysia director, said on Monday.
The court is set to hear the request at noon (0400 GMT). 
Malaysia has not responded publicly to critics or Reuters queries over the deportation of the asylum seekers and those registered with the UNHCR. 
Concerns over deportation of unregistered asylum-seekers also persist as the UNHCR has not been allowed to interview detainees for over a year to verify their status, amid a crackdown on undocumented migrants in Malaysia.

The U.S. and other Western missions have been trying to dissuade Malaysia from proceeding with the deportation and urged the government to allow the UNHCR to interview the detainees. They also say Malaysia is legitimising the military government by cooperating with the junta.

Her comments, made at a regular weekly news conference, come after a key member of China's cabinet signalled changes to Hong Kong's electoral system that would further reduce the pro-democracy opposition's influence in the city.
Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said Hong Kong can only be ruled by ""patriots"", a term he said includes people who love China, its constitution and the Communist Party and excludes anti-China ""troublemakers.""
The measures would further consolidate the authoritarian turn Hong Kong has taken since Beijing's imposition of a sweeping national security law in June 2020 and the arrest of most of its prominent democratic politicians and activists.
Lam built on Xia's comments on Tuesday, listing a series of anti-government protests since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under an agreement that preserved wide-ranging freedoms not present in mainland China. 
Protests demanding democracy or blocking legislation proposed by the various pro-Beijing governments, which culminated with the mass demonstrations in 2019, stoked ""hatred"" against Beijing and the Hong Kong government, Lam said.
""These series of incidents made the central government worried, and of course, for me, as the chief executive, it is also worrying,"" Lam told reporters.
""To stop the situation from worsening to a point that 'one country, two systems' could hardly be carried out, the problems need to be tackled at a central government level.""
The changes, likely to be announced in March, are expected to restrict who could run in legislative elections and lead to the disqualification of most lower-level district councillors - the majority of them being pro-democracy politicians.

New rules could also skew a 1,200-member committee which elects the city's leader in favour of the pro-Beijing camp.

Celebrations to mark the Emperor's birthday have been muted this year because of the pandemic.
""Fortunately, the number of new infections appears to be declining nationwide. Furthermore, coronavirus vaccinations have started,"" Naruhito said, speaking to reporters at the imperial palace from behind a large transparent partition.
""I look forward to a bright future ahead, as our people overcome the coronavirus crisis by sharing the pain and helping each other, "" Naruhito said.
Japan's COVID-19 vaccination started this month, but one of the world's most rapidly ageing societies faces challenges with the programme.
There will be limited supplies of vaccine doses for the first months of the rollout and shots for the elderly will be distributed gradually, the inoculation chief said on Monday.
On the Emperor's birthday, visitors usually come to the imperial palace to offer good wishes and sign a guestbook — a practice that dates back to 1948. The Emperor also appears on a palace balcony with other members of the imperial family to speak to visitors.
Those events were cancelled this year. Naruhito's new year public appearance last month was also replaced by a video message.

The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control said the move took aim at General Maung Maung Kyaw, who is the air force commander in chief, and Lieutenant General Moe Myint Tun, a former army chief of staff and commander of one of the military's special operations bureaus which oversee operations from the capital, Naypyidaw.
""The military must reverse its actions and urgently restore the democratically elected government in Burma, or the Treasury Department will not hesitate to take further action,"" the department said in a statement.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the threat. ""We will not hesitate to take further action against those who perpetrate violence and suppress the will of the people,"" Blinken said in a statement.
A general strike against military rule shut businesses in Myanmar on Monday and huge crowds gathered peacefully despite fears of violence after authorities warned that confrontation could be deadly.
Three weeks after seizing power, the junta has failed to stop the daily protests and a civil disobedience movement calling for the reversal of the coup and release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
""We call on the military and police to cease all attacks on peaceful protesters, immediately release all those unjustly detained, stop attacks on and intimidation of journalists and activists, and restore the democratically elected government,"" Blinken said.
Like several military officers named in the first round of U.S. sanctions on Myanmar since the coup, both generals blacklisted on Monday have been appointed as members of the junta's State Administration Council.

Their designation freezes any U.S. assets they may have and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Police in Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, are deploying an armed rollerblading unit to curb theft and harassment on its teeming streets.
Gliding in a circle with their weapons pointed inwards, and lifting and lowering the guns in unison, the 20-member unit clad in black undergoes rigorous training.
""We felt we needed to come up with an innovative approach to control street crime,"" said Farrukh Ali, chief of the unit, explaining that officers on rollerblades could more easily chase thieves on motorcycles through the city of 20 million.
Ali conceded that rollerblading police could not be deployed across many parts of Karachi due to the poor road conditions and uneven footpaths, but said they would be sent to public places with a higher incidence of theft and harassment.
""This is just the beginning,"" said Aneela Aslam, a policewoman on the unit. ""This rollerblading will really benefit us. With this training, we can reach narrow alleys very quickly where it is usually difficult to go.""
Safety concerns were raised when initial footage of the Karachi unit's training showed officers carrying heavier weapons, but Ali said the unit would only carry handguns, reducing the risk of bullets richocheting.
The rollerblading police - who follow in the footsteps of similar units in Europe and elsewhere - are expected to begin officially next month, but they were recently spotted outside the venue of the Pakistan Super League cricket tournament. 
And they have already begun patrolling Karachi's bustling beachfront. 

""Seeing them here in clean uniforms since the morning gives us a sense of security, as even in daytime, snatchings occur here,"" said pedestrian Muhammad Azeem.

MONTERREY, Mexico (Reuters) - The United States abruptly canceled plans on Monday to bring asylum seekers into Texas at two ports of entry, dashing the hopes of hundreds who have been waiting for months in Mexico under a Trump-era policy President Joe Biden promised to unwind.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement that ""given current operational considerations,"" it could no longer say when it would begin bringing in migrants through ports in Brownsville and El Paso, Texas. The department said last week it would start accepting asylum seekers with active cases at those locations on Monday and Friday, respectively. Texas is recovering from a winter storm that knocked out power and water services across the state. 
A DHS spokeswoman did not give a specific reason for the delay, but said the agency would begin to use those locations once international partners implemented certain measures to ensure security, health and adequate processing systems. 
Biden pledged to roll back the Trump-era program, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), which forced more than 65,000 mostly Central American asylum seekers back across the border pending U.S. immigration court hearings. Most returned home but some stayed in Mexico in sometimes squalid or dangerous conditions, vulnerable to kidnapping and other violence.
The Biden administration has said it will first seek to deal with about 25,000 people with active cases, and the United Nations has set up a website for people to register. 
""We are really confused because we don't see any change. We are just looking for help,"" said Josue Cornejo, a migrant from Honduras who has been stuck in a makeshift camp in Matamoros, Mexico, across the border from Brownsville, for over a year. ""They aren't telling us anything,"" he said in a video message.
The effort to reverse the program started slowly on Friday at a port of entry in San Ysidro, California, where so far 50 asylum seekers have been processed, according to Democratic Representative Nanette Barragan who visited the border.
In recent days, several hundred migrants have amassed across the border in Tijuana, many of them not in the MPP program but hoping to be allowed to enter the United States. The migrants include some families with small children and people setting up tents. 
U.S. officials say anyone who seeks to enter and does not have an active MPP case will be immediately expelled under COVID-era rules.
A U.N. official said on Monday that the organization has registered more than 7,700 migrants with active cases since Friday. The official said asylum seekers in the Matamoros camp could be processed in coming days. 
The global body is also tasked with testing migrants for COVID-19 in Mexico before they arrive at U.S. ports of entry, while non-profits on the U.S. side are providing shelters for migrants to quarantine upon arrival.

Mark Manly, a U.N. official in Mexico, told Reuters on Friday that the website ran slowly at times, but called it ""teething problems.""

Mexico's Federal Audit Office (ASF) said it estimated that canceling the partly-built airport on the city's eastern flank cost nearly 332 billion pesos ($16 billion), or 232 billion pesos more than the transport ministry stated in April 2019.
""I would like them to explain that figure,"" Lopez Obrador told a news conference.
""It's wrong, it's an exaggeration,"" he added, and suggested the ASF was helping his adversaries.
Following a widely criticized referendum he had called for, Lopez Obrador in late October 2018 announced the termination of the project, his predecessor's flagship infrastructure scheme, which was initially slated to cost $13 billion.
Lopez Obrador was elected president in July 2018, and he made the cancellation call on the basis of the referendum nearly five weeks before he took office in December that year.
He argued the airport project was riddled with corruption and geologically unsound. Barely 1 percent of the population took part in the vote, which the president's party oversaw.
The ambitious project's cancellation rattled financial markets, and though the government spent billions of dollars paying off investors, Lopez Obrador has always maintained that his decision had saved the public coffers billions.
Afterwards, he ordered the construction of a cheaper alternative airport north of the city, overseen by the army.
The ASF report also highlighted other public sector waste during 2019 on Lopez Obrador's watch, which he also questioned.

""Their figures are wrong,"" he said. ""I have other data.""

DENVER (Reuters) - A Colorado police officer had no apparent reasonable grounds to suspect a crime was being committed when he approached an unarmed Black man walking home from a convenience store, and within seconds escalated a stop that led to the man's death, a report by independent investigators released on Monday said.
The City Council in the Denver suburb of Aurora had requested the investigation after the 2019 death of 23-year-old Elijah McClain attracted renewed scrutiny amid international demonstrations against racism and police killings of Black Americans following the death last May of George Floyd in Minnesota. 
Earlier probes by city departments had determined that the officers and paramedics involved in McClain's death had not violated policy and the prosecutor declined to bring charges.
Monday's report resulting from an investigation led by Jonathan Smith, a former head of special litigation for the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, concluded that Aurora police ""failed to ask basic, critical questions"" that would have helped prosecutors determine whether the force used was justified. Police investigators instead asked questions that appeared designed to elicit comments that would exonerate the officers involved, according to the report.
Aurora police and paramedic officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Smith's report was to be discussed at an Aurora City Council meeting on Monday.
Mari Newman, an attorney for McClain's family, said in a statement that the independent report ""confirms what we have known all along: Aurora police and medics violated Elijah McClain’s civil rights, and Aurora did everything in its power to sweep his murder under the rug."" 
McClain's family has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit. 
According to the 153-page report by Smith and two colleagues - one a former Arizona chief of police and the other a doctor who directs emergency medical services in Alabama - Aurora Police Officer Nathan Woodyard decided in less than 10 seconds after McClain was stopped as he was walking alone late on August 24, 2019 ""to turn what may have been a consensual encounter with Mr. McClain into an investigatory stop"" without apparent grounds. 
McClain went into cardiac arrest after he was subdued by three police officers. Woodyard was the first officer to have responded to a report from a passerby that McClain had been acting suspiciously.
Police restrained McClain using an oxygen-depriving neck hold. Police called paramedics who administered a dose of ketamine, a sedative. McClain died days later in hospital.

The independent investigators concluded that paramedics failed to properly examine McClain before injecting the sedative.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's parliament passed a non-binding motion on Monday saying China's treatment of the Uighur Muslim minority in the Xinjiang region constitutes genocide, putting pressure on Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to follow suit.
Canada's House of Commons voted 266-0 for the motion brought by the opposition Conservative Party. Trudeau and his Cabinet abstained from the vote, although Liberal backbenchers widely backed it.
The motion was also amended just before the vote to call on the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympics from Beijing if the treatment continues. 
Trudeau's Conservative rivals have been pressuring him to get tougher on China. After Canada arrested Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in 2018 on a U.S. warrant, China detained two Canadians on spying charges, igniting lingering diplomatic tensions between the two countries.
China has been widely condemned for setting up complexes in Xinjiang that it describes as “vocational training centers” to stamp out extremism and give people new skills, and which others have called concentration camps. Beijing denies accusations of abuses in Xinjiang.
Citing testimony, documents and media reports of human rights abuses against Uighurs, Conservative lawmaker Michael Chong said: ""We can no longer ignore this. We must call it for what it is — a genocide."" 
Trudeau has been reluctant to use the word genocide, suggesting that seeking broad consensus among Western allies on Chinese human rights issues would be the best approach.
""Moving forward multilaterally will be the best way to demonstrate the solidarity of Western democracies ... that are extremely concerned and dismayed by reports of what's going on in Xinjiang,"" Trudeau said on Friday after speaking to fellow G7 leaders.
Trudeau and U.S. President Joe Biden will hold a virtual bilateral meeting on Tuesday afternoon, and relations with China are likely to be discussed, a government source said. 
Former U.S. President Donald Trump - on his last full day in office last month - said China had committed ""genocide and crimes against humanity"" by repressing Uighur Muslims. 
The Biden administration is trying to ensure that the genocide declaration is upheld, according to his pick to be ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield.
Cong Peiwu, the Chinese ambassador to Ottawa, denied accusations of genocide.

""Western countries are in no position to say what the human rights situation in China looks like,"" Cong said in an interview before the vote. ""There is no so-called genocide in Xinjiang at all.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday Iran might enrich uranium up to 60% purity if the country needed it and would never yield to U.S. pressure over its nuclear programme, state television reported.
Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers, which it has been breaching since the United States withdrew in 2018, caps the fissile purity to which Tehran can refine uranium at 3.67%, well under the 20% achieved before the agreement and far below the 90% suitable for a nuclear weapon. 
""Iran's uranium enrichment level will not be limited to 20%. We will increase it to whatever level the country needs ... We may increase it to 60%,"" the TV quoted Khamenei as saying, upping the ante in a stand-off with U.S. President Joe Biden's administration over the future of the fraying deal.
""Americans and the European parties to the deal have used unjust language against Iran ... Iran will not yield to pressure. Our stance will not change,"" Khamenei said.
U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Khamenei's comments ""sounds like a threat"" and declined to respond to what he described as ""hypotheticals"" and ""posturing"".
He reiterated U.S. willingness to engage in talks with Iran about returning to the 2015 nuclear deal.
The Biden administration said last week it was ready to talk to Iran about both nations returning to the accord abandoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump.
Tehran said last week it was studying a European Union proposal for an informal meeting between current members of the deal and the United States, but has yet to respond to it.
Iran, which has resumed enriching to 20% in an apparent bid to heap pressure on the United States, has been at loggerheads with Washington over which side should take the initial step to revive the accord.
Although under domestic pressure to ease economic hardships worsened by sanctions, Iranian leaders insist Washington must end its punitive campaign first to restore the deal, while Washington says Tehran must first return to full compliance.
DIPLOMACY PATH
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday Washington intended to bolster and extend the 2015 pact, which aimed to limit Iran's enrichment potential - a possible pathway to atomic bombs - in exchange for a lifting of most sanctions.
Blinken, addressing the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, said in a pre-recorded speech: ""The United States remains committed to ensuring that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon. Diplomacy is the best path to achieve that goal.""
Khamenei, in his televised remarks, repeated a denial of any Iranian intent to weaponise uranium enrichment.
He added: ""That international Zionist clown (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu) has said they won't allow Iran to produce nuclear weapons. First of all, if we had any such intention, even those more powerful than him wouldn't be able to stop us."" 
To pressure the Biden administration to drop sanctions, Iran's hardline-dominated parliament passed a law last year obliging the government to end roving snap inspections by the U.N. nuclear watchdog from Tuesday if sanctions are not lifted.
Iran's envoy to the IAEA, Kazem Gharibabadi, said Iran had ended the implementation of the so-called Additional Protocol, which allows International Atomic Energy Agency to carry out short-notice inspections at midnight (2030 GMT).
To create room for diplomacy, the U.N. watchdog on Sunday reached a deal with Iran to cushion the blow of Iran's reduced cooperation and refusal to permit short-notice inspections.

Iranian lawmakers protested on Monday at Tehran's decision to permit ""necessary"" monitoring by U.N. inspectors for up to three months, saying this broke the new law.

""We have seen the reports of the rocket fire today ... as you heard us say in the aftermath of the tragic attack in Erbil, we are outraged by the recent attacks,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.
Most attacks cause no casualties but the latest rocket attack, on Monday, was the third in Iraq in just over a week to target Green Zone areas that host U.S. troops, diplomats or contractors.
Price said the United States was still determining who was behind last week's attack on the Erbil International Airport compound that killed a contractor working with U.S. forces at the military base on the compound.
""When it comes to our response, we will respond in a way that’s calculated within our own timetable and using a mix of tools at a time and place of our choosing,"" Price said of the Erbil attack. ""What we will not do is lash out and risk an escalation that plays into the hands of Iran, and contributes to their attempts to further destabilize Iraq.""

At least two rockets hit Baghdad's fortified Green Zone on Monday but caused no casualties, the Iraqi military said. The rockets in such attacks are typically fired by groups that U.S. and Iraqi officials say are backed by Iran.

Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in long-running cases involving gifts from millionaire friends and for allegedly seeking regulatory favours for media tycoons in return for favourable coverage.
The charges against him have been a central issue during three elections in which no clear winner emerged. Israel will hold its fourth parliamentary election in two years on March 23.
This month he pleaded not guilty before a three-judge panel in a heavily guarded Jerusalem District Court.
The court ruled late on Monday that evidence in the trial would be heard starting on April 5.

Opinion polls show the race too close to call, as right-wing rivals and centre-left opponents seek to challenge Israel’s longest-serving leader. Netanyahu has been prime minister continuously since 2009 after a first term from 1996 to 1999.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. official played down comments by the Iranian supreme leader on Monday that Tehran could enrich uranium to 60% purity, saying that would be concerning but Iran has not done so yet and Washington is waiting to see if Tehran will return to talks.
The United States on Thursday offered to sit down with the Iranians along with other parties to a 2015 nuclear deal to see if there is a way to return to the pact abandoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump.
The crux of the deal was that Iran would limit its uranium enrichment program to make it harder to amass the fissile material for a nuclear weapon - an ambition it has long denied - in return for relief from U.S. and other economic sanctions. 
Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tehran may enrich uranium up to 60% purity if the country needed it, state TV reported, adding that Tehran will never yield to the U.S. pressure over its nuclear work.
Iran has responded to Trump's abandonment of the nuclear deal and restoration of U.S. sanctions by reducing its own compliance, including by enriching uranium up to 20%, above the pact's 3.67% limit but well below the 90% that is weapons grade.
""Until you get back to talks, both sides are going to take positions ... to elevate the tone. But I don't know that we need to focus on that. Let's see whether they agree to come back to the table,"" said the U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The White House said U.S allies in Europe are still waiting for Iran to respond to the European Union's offer to host talks among parties to the nuclear deal, which included Iran, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States.
""There is no doubt that if we don't reach an understanding, they will continue to expand their nuclear program ... whether it's what he says they will do - 60% - or something else,"" said the U.S. official.
""Both sides are now accumulating leverage, whether it's them with their nuclear steps, or us with the sanctions that have been imposed. That's not really helping either side,"" the U.S. official added.
It would be ""very concerning"" to Washington if Iran enriched to 60%, but it had not yet done so, the official said.
The United States wants to ""find a way so that neither side feels a need to escalate but to the contrary wants to get back to the place where both sides are in compliance,"" the official added.
In a sign Iran plans to further reduce its compliance, Tehran said on Monday it will end at 2030 GMT the implementation of the Additional Protocol that allows the U.N. nuclear watchdog to carry out snap inspections at sites not declared to the agency, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Sunday it had struck an agreement with Iran to cushion the blow of steps Tehran plans to take this week, including an end to snap inspections, with both sides agreeing to keep ""necessary"" monitoring for up to three months.

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 01:49PM ET</span>",More German state workers to get AstraZeneca jab as doses go begging,"By Andreas Rinke and Douglas Busvine
BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government is reworking its strategy to vaccinate the nation against COVID-19 as its campaign, which has faltered due to a lack of supply, also faces public resistance to the shot from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc.
As schools and kindergartens start to reopen from a lockdown imposed in November, federal and state health ministers on Monday reworked vaccination rules so that teachers will now get priority access to the AstraZeneca vaccine.
""Children, the young, and their parents are especially affected by lockdown,"" they said in a document seen by Reuters. ""Since it can be hard to ensure social distancing with young children, teachers must be protected in another way.""
Health Minister Jens Spahn has also requested that the AstraZeneca shot be given to the police force and army, after some health and other frontline workers baulked at receiving it.
The AstraZeneca vaccine has met resistance in Germany and other European countries after trials showed it to be less effective than alternatives from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc.
Anecdotal reports that the AstraZeneca vaccine causes stronger side effects than other vaccines have been confirmed by Germany's top vaccines agency, the Paul Ehrlich Institute.
It found that nearly a quarter of people receiving the AstraZeneca shot experienced flu-like symptoms, and around 15% experienced shivers or fever - more than side effects reported from the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines.
German leaders have launched a public relations push to reassure the public that the AstraZeneca shot, developed at Britain's Oxford University, works.
""The vaccine from AstraZeneca is both safe and highly effective,"" Steffen Seibert, Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief spokesman, tweeted on Monday. ""The vaccine can save lives.""
AstraZeneca says that the reported side effects are in line with observations from its clinical trials. The Paul Ehrlich Institute has called the vaccine highly effective and described reactions to it as short-lived.
SLOW GOING
Germany has administered 5 million vaccine doses so far, or around six for every 100 residents, putting it well behind countries like Israel, Britain or the United States that have more aggressive campaigns.
Most are of the Pfizer vaccine, which was developed by Germany's BioNTech, have been given so far to the elderly and infirm.
Of the 1.5 million AstraZeneca shots due to have been delivered by the end of last week, only 187,000 have been used so far, according to figures from the health ministry and Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases.
With the AstraZeneca vaccine only approved for people of working age, Spahn has asked that the German army be mobilized to administer it to state workers like police and soldiers, news weekly Spiegel reported.
Asked to comment on the report, Spahn's ministry confirmed it had asked the army for help in setting up two vaccination centres in Bonn and Berlin for state employees in uniform.
Although Germany, like other European Union member states, had got off to a slow start, latest government figures indicate that it will take delivery of at least 10 million further doses by March 4.
Spahn wants to start administering vaccines at family doctors' practices as soon as 3 million to 5 million doses are delivered weekly, he told a meeting of leaders of Merkel's conservative party earlier according to sources present.
That would help ease potential bottlenecks at the regional vaccination centres that have been set up by Germany's 16 federal states.

While coronavirus cases have fallen in recent weeks, the rate of decline has slowed with the seven-day incidence rate hovering at around 60 cases per 100,000. On Monday, Germany reported 4,369 new infections and 62 further deaths.

GENEVA (Reuters) - China on Monday rejected ""slanderous attacks"" about conditions for Muslim Uighurs living in Xinjiang, as European powers and Turkey voiced concerns and called for U.N. access to the remote western region.
Activists and U.N. rights experts have said that at least 1 million Muslims are detained in camps in Xinjiang. China denies abuses and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.
Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the U.N. Human Rights Council that it was taking counter-terrorism measures in accordance with the law and that Xinjiang enjoyed ""social stability and sound development"" after four years without any ""terrorist case"".
There were 24,000 mosques in Xinjiang, where people of all ethnic groups also enjoyed labour rights, he said.
""These basic facts show that there has never been so-called genocide, forced labour, or religious oppression in Xinjiang,"" Wang said. ""Such inflammatory accusations are fabricated out of ignorance and prejudice, they are simply malicious and politically driven hype and couldn't be further from the truth.""
The Biden administration has endorsed a last-minute determination by the Trump administration that China has committed genocide in Xinjiang and has said the United States must be prepared to impose costs on China.
Earlier, British foreign secretary Dominic Raab denounced torture, forced labour and sterilisations that he said were taking place against Uighurs on an ""industrial scale"" in Xinjiang. 
Germany's foreign minister Heiko Maas said that ""the arbitrary detention of ethnic minorities like the Uighurs in Xinjiang or China's crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong"" required attention.
Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, said it expected transparency from China on the issue and called for protecting the rights of Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang.
Wang invited U.N. scrutiny but gave no timetable. 

""The door to Xinjiang is always open. People from many countries who have visited Xinjiang have learned the facts and the truth on the ground. China also welcomes the High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Xinjiang,"" he said, referring to U.N. rights chief Michelle Bachelet, whose office has been negotiating terms of access to the country.

LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization has agreed a no-fault compensation plan for claims of serious side effects in people in 92 poorer countries due to get COVID-19 vaccines via the COVAX sharing scheme, resolving a big concern among recipient governments.
The programme, which the WHO said was the first and only vaccine injury compensation mechanism operating on an international scale, will offer eligible people ""a fast, fair, robust and transparent process"", the WHO said in a statement.
""By providing a no-fault lump-sum compensation in full and final settlement of any claims, the COVAX programme aims to significantly reduce the need for recourse to the law courts, a potentially lengthy and costly process,"" the statement said.
Questions of how compensation claims would be handled in the event of any serious COVID-19 vaccine side effects, which are likely to be very rare, had been a worry for countries due to get COVID-19 shots via the COVAX plan.
Countries funding their own COVID-19 vaccine procurement also plan their own liability programmes. 
The WHO-agreed plan, which has been under discussion for several months, is designed to cover serious side effects linked to any COVAX-distributed vaccines until June 30, 2022, to COVAX's Advance Market Commitment-eligible economies - a group of 92 poorer states which includes most African and Southeast Asian countries.
The programme will be financed initially from donor funding to the AMC as an extra charge on all doses of COVID-19 vaccines distributed through COVAX. Applications can be made via a portal at http://www.covaxclaims.com from March 31, 2021, the WHO said.
Seth Berkley, chief executive of the GAVI vaccine alliance which co-leads COVAX, said the agreement on the compensation fund was ""a massive boost"" for COVAX, which aims to secure equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines.
""It helps those in countries who might have such effects, manufacturers to roll out vaccines to countries faster, and is a key benefit for lower-income governments procuring vaccines through (COVAX),"" Berkley said.

The WHO said it was also working with the insurance firm Chubb (NYSE:CB) to secure insurance coverage for the programme.

TUNIS (Reuters) - A standoff over a cabinet reshuffle in Tunisia has accelerated a power struggle between the president, prime minister and parliament speaker that threatens to spill over into street protests by rival blocs and bring down the government. 
The dispute has been building since a 2019 election delivered a fragmented parliament and a political outsider as president, creating a constant state of political turmoil in the only country to emerge with an intact democracy from the ""Arab Spring"" revolts a decade ago.
It has come to a head as Tunisia attempts to navigate the economic havoc wrought by COVID-19, while facing the biggest protests for years and public debt levels that have spooked capital markets needed to finance the state budget.
If the government falls, appointing a new one could take weeks, further delaying fiscal reforms needed to win financing.
""Today the revolution faces its most severe crisis and the solution is dialogue leading to change in the constitution, the political system, the electoral system,"" said Zouhair Maghzaoui, head of the Chaab political party, which has backed President Kais Saied in his dispute with Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi.
Saied has vowed not to swear in four ministers nominated in a reshuffle by Mechichi, saying each has a possible conflict of interest.
Mechichi, who took office last summer, is backed by Parliament Speaker Rached Ghannouchi, head of the moderate Islamist Ennahda, the only major political party to have weathered Tunisia's first decade of democracy. 
The 2011 revolution jettisoned autocracy, but many Tunisians have been disillusioned by a bad economy. Meanwhile, a power sharing system established in a 2014 constitution has led to constant squabbling between presidents, prime ministers and parliamentary leaders. 
Both parliament and the president are required to approve a prime minister, who has most executive powers while the president oversees defence and foreign affairs. 
A constitutional court, envisaged to resolve disputes between rival branches of the state, has not been formed yet because none of those in power can agree on judges they trust to be impartial.
Saied wants a presidential system with only a minor role for political parties. Ghannouchi and his allies want a more clearly parliamentary system. 
""The president wants to be the main player... he wants a puppet prime minister,"" said Sadok Jabnoun, a senior official in jailed media mogul Nabil Karoui's Heart of Tunisia party and a supporter of Mechichi. 
RIVAL PROTESTS
Recent protests against inequality and police abuses have mostly directed anger at Mechichi and Ghannouchi. 
However, Ghannouchi's Ennahda has called for its own members to demonstrate on Saturday to ""protect democracy"" and oppose Saied's rejection of Mechichi's reshuffle.
Other parties with opposing views have also called for demonstrations. 
The spectre of rival protests recalls the extreme polarisation that gripped Tunisia in 2013 and 2014 before Ennahda and a group of secular parties averted violence by agreeing to share power. 
Saied, a political outsider, won the 2019 presidential election run-off vote in a landslide that, analysts say, he saw as a strong personal mandate and a rejection of the parties that dominate parliament. 
Meanwhile the parliamentary election left a chamber in which no party had more than a quarter of votes, making it all but impossible for a government to gain stable majority backing.

""I am not ready to back down from my principles,"" Saied said of the dispute, adding that the presidency was not a mere post office to uncritically receive decisions sent by prime ministers.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian pharmaceutical companies Bharat Biotech and Biological E. Ltd said on Monday they could quickly rework their COVID-19 vaccine products to fight new variants once their genetic sequence is known.
In recent months, India has confirmed the presence of the variants first identified in Brazil, Britain and South Africa, which are believed to explain an upsurge in cases in the Indian states of Maharashtra and Kerala. 
In all, India has reported more than 11 million coronavirus infections, the highest number in the world after the United States, and about 156,000 deaths.
""As we are seeing a lot of resurgence of cases, we are picking up samples from hotspots and clusters and we are trying to sequence them,"" Nivedita Gupta, deputy director-general of the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), told the BioAsia conference.
ICMR and Bharat Biotech have collaborated to develop India's first homegrown COVID-19 vaccine, which, along with another licensed from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University, is being used in the country's immunisation campaign that has covered more than 10 million people since mid-January.
India is the world's biggest maker of vaccines, and its companies have promised to produce billions of doses of COVID-19 shots.
Bharat Biotech Chairman Krishna Ella said his company would mainly need data from the ICMR or the World Health Organization on the genetic sequence of any variant to quickly make an effective vaccine.
Speaking at a conference organised by the state of Telangana, home to India's vaccine hub Hyderabad, Ella said a product to tackle the South African variant could be made in 15 days and would not require any change to the manufacturing process.
Biological E. Managing Director Mahima Datla said there was no need to be ""overly concerned"" about the mutations.
""Eventually we don't know which variant of the virus, which mutants will take over, but we think that it's prudent to work on technologies that address the new variants as well,"" she said.
Biological E., which is developing a vaccine with Houston's Baylor College of Medicine and Dynavax (NASDAQ:DVAX) Technologies, recently completed Phase 1/2 clinical trial in India, Datla said.
Its product uses the recombinant-protein technology in which a harmless agent is used to stimulate an immune response in cells.

""Once you know the variant, when it's sequenced, it is fairly quick to deploy into a vaccine,"" said Datla, whose company will also contract-manufacture Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s shot.

Russia provided Belarus with a $1.5 billion loan last September in a gesture of support for Lukashenko as protesters took to the streets across Belarus following an Aug. 9 election which opponents say was rigged. 
Lukashenko denies electoral fraud and has clung to power with the backing of the Kremlin, which said at the time that the money was to be put towards refinancing previous loans.
""I am of course very grateful for the economic support that you provide to Belarus,"" Lukashenko told Putin during talks in the southern Russian city of Sochi. ""I must inform you that this has not been in vain. The money has not been wasted.""
Russia's Kommersant newspaper quoted government sources this month as saying Lukashenko would ask Putin for another loan worth $3 billion, but the veteran Belarusian leader denied he was seeking additional money. 
Lukashenko responded to the protests with a violent crackdown. Opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who is based in Lithuania, told Swiss newspaper Le Temps last week the opposition had lost the streets for now because protesters could not counter the force used by the police.
On Monday, a court in the Belarusian city of Homiel sentenced 17-year-old Mikita Zalatarou to five years in prison for allegedly taking past in riots last August. Two other protesters were sentenced to six and eight years, respectively. 

Authorities are also prosecuting Viktor Babariko, a former banking executive who was detained on corruption charges which his team said were fabricated to prevent him from standing as a candidate in last year's presidential election.

In an application in the constitutional court seen by Reuters, the ""state capture"" inquiry is seeking an order that Zuma is guilty of contempt of court for not turning up last week or providing affidavits when instructed to do so.
The inquiry is examining allegations of high-level graft during Zuma's period in power from 2009 to 2018.
Zuma denies wrongdoing and has not cooperated with the inquiry. His no-show last week came despite the inquiry summoning him to appear and the constitutional court directing him to comply with that summons and give testimony.
Zuma's lawyer Eric Mabuza was not available when called by Reuters seeking comment.
The allegations against Zuma include that he allowed businessmen close to him - brothers Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta - to plunder state resources and influence policy.
The Guptas, who also deny wrongdoing, left South Africa after Zuma was ousted in a move orchestrated by allies of his successor Cyril Ramaphosa.

Ramaphosa has been trying to restore investor confidence in Africa's most industrialised nation. However, he has faced opposition from a faction within the governing African National Congress party that is still loyal to Zuma.

Three weeks after seizing power, the junta has failed to stop the daily protests and a civil disobedience movement calling for the reversal of the Feb. 1 coup and release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. 
Hundreds of thousands gathered in cities and towns across the country, from the northern hills on the border with China to the central plains, the Irrawaddy river delta and the southern tip of the panhandle, social media images showed.
For protester Kyaw Kyaw in the main city of Yangon, losing pay to join the strike was a small price to pay.
""Nothing's going to happen if my salary is cut but if we stay under a military dictatorship we'll be slaves,"" he said.
In the capital, Naypyitaw, where the military is headquartered, a police water cannon truck and a fleet of other vehicles closed in to break up a procession of chanting protesters who scattered when police on foot rushed in, wrestling several to the ground.
The response of security forces this month has been less deadly than in earlier bouts of turmoil in almost half a century of direct military rule but three protesters have been killed - two shot dead in Mandalay on Saturday, and a woman who died on Friday after being shot more than a week earlier in Naypyitaw. 
The army has said one policeman died of injuries sustained during the protests. It has accused protesters of provoking violence.
Late on Sunday, state-owned media MRTV warned that confrontation could cost lives.
""Protesters are now inciting the people, especially emotional teenagers and youths, to a confrontation path where they will suffer loss of life,"" the broadcaster said.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said on Monday it had removed MRTV's pages for violations of its standards, including its violence and incitement policy. On Sunday, it deleted the military's main page for the same reason.
Military-run Myawaddy News reported that junta chief General Min Aung Hlaing had said the military was following a democratic path and, referring to rubber bullets, that it wanted to use minimal force.
""Nothing is more important than human life. That's why military is controlling the situation carefully,"" the broadcaster quoted him as saying.
Talk of a general strike was a rumour and markets and shops were open, it said.
As well as local stores, international chains announced closures on Monday, including Yum Brands Inc.'s KFC and delivery service Food Panda, owned by Delivery Hero. Southeast Asian company Grab stopped delivery services too, but left its taxis running.
'WE'RE GOING'
In a country where dates are seen as auspicious, protesters noted the significance of the date 22.2.2021, comparing it with demonstrations on Aug. 8, 1988, when a previous generation staged anti-military protests that were bloodily suppressed.
But that and the government warning did not put people off.
""We need to come out,"" said San San Maw, 46, at a main rallying point in Yangon.
Later, riot police lined up, apparently preparing to disperse protesters from outside a U.N. office, but the crowd broke up after singing a festive song that features the line: ""Goodbye, we're going"".
Crowds elsewhere in Yangon melted away by late afternoon.
Several Western countries have condemned the coup and decried violence against protesters. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Twitter the United States would continue to ""take firm action"" against authorities cracking down on opponents of the coup.
Britain, Germany and Japan have condemned the violence and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the military to stop repression.
Myanmar has denounced interference in its affairs.
The army seized power after alleging fraud in Nov. 8 elections in which Suu Kyi's party trounced a pro-military party, detaining her and much of the party leadership. The electoral commission dismissed the fraud complaints.

A rights group said that as of late Sunday, 640 people had been arrested in connection with the coup.

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Italy's ambassador to Democratic Republic of Congo, his bodyguard and a driver from the World Food Programme were killed on Monday when their convoy was attacked in the east of the country, Italy and the United Nations said.
The convoy was attacked at about 10:15 a.m. (0815 GMT) in an attempted kidnap near the town of Kanyamahoro, about 25 km (15 miles) north of the regional capital Goma, a spokesman for the Virunga National Park told Reuters.
The deaths of the ambassador, Luca Attanasio, 43, Italian military policeman Vittorio Iacovacci, 30, and a Congolese driver, whose name has not been released, were confirmed by the Italian government in a statement.
The driver was working for the U.N. World Food Programme, it said in a statement, adding that a number of other passengers were injured.
Dozens of armed groups operate in and around Virunga, which lies along Congo's borders with Rwanda and Uganda. Park rangers have been repeatedly attacked and six were killed in an ambush last month. 
The governor of North Kivu province, Carly Nzanzu Kasivita, told Reuters the assailants stopped the convoy by firing warning shots. They killed the driver and were leading the others into the forest when park rangers opened fire. The attackers killed the bodyguard and the ambassador also died, Nzanzu said. 
Virunga spokesman Oliver Mukisya said there were no indications yet of who was behind the attack, nor was there any immediate claim of responsibility.
""I promise the Italian government that my country's government will do everything to discover who is behind this awful murder,"" Congo's foreign minister Marie Ntumba Nzeza said.
CLEARED FOR TRAVEL
WFP said the delegation was on its way to visit a school feeding programme in Rutshuru. It said the road had previously been cleared for travel without security escorts. 
Photos shared on social media showed Attanasio lying in the arms of a man in the back of a park authority jeep and the broken window of a WFP vehicle. Reuters has not verified the images.
""It was with great shock and immense sorrow that I learned of the death today of our Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo and of a Carabinieri policeman,"" Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said in a statement.

Data analysed by Public Health England (PHE) showed the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) provided high levels of protection against infection and symptomatic disease from a single dose, and that hospitalisation and death from COVID-19 will be reduced by more 75% in elderly people who have had a first dose.
""Overall, we're seeing a really strong effect to reducing any infection, asymptomatic and symptomatic,"" PHE's strategic response director Susan Hopkins told a media briefing.
PHE's head of immunisation Mary Ramsay described the data as ""strong evidence that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is stopping people from getting infected, while also protecting cases against hospitalisation and death"".
""We should be very encouraged by these initial findings,"" she said.
PHE's findings came from two separate analyses - one is an ongoing study in healthcare workers, and the second is an assessment of testing data in people aged 80 and over.
Evidence from the elderly group showed that one dose of the Pfizer shot is 57% effective against symptomatic COVID-19 disease, PHE said, and early data suggest the second dose improves protection to more than 85%. 
""Hospitalisation and deaths rates are falling in all age groups, but the oldest age groups are seeing the fastest decline since the peak in mid-January,"" a PHE statement said. 
The vaccine also provides protection against the so-called British variant of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, it added.
The PHE data come as preliminary study findings from Scotland on Monday also showed the vaccination drive there is working, markedly reducing the risk of hospitalisation for COVID-19. 

Scottish researchers said those findings suggested that both the Pfizer and the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe infections.

Chanting ""A civilian state not a military state!"", ""Enough is enough!"" and ""The people want independence!"", protesters walked through the centre of the capital, waving national flags, watched by large numbers of police. 
Some of the protesters hope to revive the twice-weekly protests that surged through Algerian cities from February 2019 for more than a year, regularly bringing tens of thousands of people to the streets until the global pandemic began. 
""We are determined to continue our battle until victory,"" said Djamel Habi, a student. 
However, some other protesters said the march was symbolic rather than a return to regular demonstrations, or that without a clear opposition leadership they were not yet sure whether to continue with protests. 
Though the 2019 protests led the army to push veteran president Abdelaziz Bouteflika from power after two decades in office and jail many senior figures for corruption, many of the demonstrators wanted a more thorough change. 
""We will stick to our principles until all demands are met,"" said Mohamed Tadjer, a 30-year old employee of Algeria's state insurance company. 
""Things must change. We are fed up,"" said Ahmed Kachime, 25, a student. 
The main demands of the leaderless, unorganised protest campaign, known as Hirak (Movement), were the ousting of Algeria's old ruling elite, an end to corruption and the army's withdrawal from politics. 
After Bouteflika was ousted, the authorities held a presidential election that Hirak supporters viewed as a sham and which resulted in Abdelmadjid Tebboune winning the presidency in December 2019. 
He made some moves to meet protesters' grievances, including minor changes to the constitution, but the very low turnout in a referendum to affirm the reforms indicated that his efforts had little public backing. 

Tebboune returned to Algeria last week after spending most of the past four months in Germany receiving medical treatment after contracting COVID-19.

A committee of City representatives agreed in January to remove the statue of William Beckford from its Guildhall home as part of a wider debate about how Britain remembers and represents history, following last year's Black Lives Matter protests. 
Beckford was twice Lord Mayor of London in the 18th century and had plantations in Jamaica with slaves.
The same committee agreed last Thursday to take a step back and halt the removal plans, two City councillors said on Monday.
Instead, a working group will evaluate all options by September, with the final decision taken by full council, chief commoner (senior councillor) Brian Mooney said.
""There are various options - do nothing, remove it, or a middle way such as contextualising it by having some sort of board,"" added councillor Oliver Lodge.
The U-turn came eight days after Britain's local government minister Robert Jenrick told senior City representatives that contested heritage should be retained and explained.

""It is in the City's own interests that heritage and tradition are given robust protection,"" Jenrick said.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Sunday it had struck a deal with Iran to cushion the blow of steps Tehran plans to take this week that include ending snap inspections, with both sides agreeing to keep ""necessary"" monitoring for up to three months.
The announcement by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi, made at Vienna airport after a weekend trip to Iran, confirmed that Tehran would go ahead with its plan to slash cooperation with the agency on Tuesday. 
Blinken, addressing the U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, said in a pre-recorded speech: ""The United States remains committed to ensuring that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon. Diplomacy is the best path to achieve that goal."" 
President Joe Biden has said that if Iran comes back into ""strict compliance"" with the 2015 pact, his administration will do the same, Blinken said.
""Working with allies and partners, we will also seek to lengthen and strengthen the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) and address other areas of concern, including Iran's destabilizing regional behavior and ballistic missile development and proliferation,"" Blinken said.

ADEN (Reuters) - Hundreds of fighters have been killed in a weeks-long Houthi offensive on the Yemeni region of Marib, military sources and a local official said on Monday, in the conflict's most deadly clashes since 2018.
The attack by Iran-aligned Houthi forces on government-held Marib city comes amid renewed diplomacy to end the six-year war, and as the United States said it would end support for a Saudi-led coalition backing the internationally recognised Yemeni government.
The United Nations has urged the Houthis to return to negotiations, and said the offensive threatened mass displacement.
Hundreds of fighters from both sides have been killed in clashes in the gas-rich Marib region, the sources said. They were not authorised to speak publicly about operational matters.
The sources added that the Houthis may have lost more fighters than the government during the offensive, with coalition forces boasting air supremacy. 
""It is a blood bath,"" said one military source. Two sources said the majority of casualties were fighters, not civilians.
Pro-government defences in Sarwah, to Marib's west, have collapsed, with the frontline now roughly 20 km (12.4 miles) from the city, according to the sources.
The death toll from the battles of the last three weeks are on a scale not seen since 2018, when Saudi-led coalition forces launched an offensive in the Red Sea coastal area to take Yemen's biggest port of Hodeidah.
That attack was stopped amid humanitarian concerns.
Mass funerals for Houthi fighters killed in the Marib operation have been held over the past week in the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa.
Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said on Twitter on Sunday their forces would keep fighting until the entire country is ""liberated"".
""What Marib is witnessing is part of a national liberation battle, in the face of the continued aggression and blockade,"" Abdulsalam said.
Abdulsalam and a spokesman for the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi did not respond to requests for comment on the reported casualties.
Yemen's frontlines have moved little in recent years, but the war has shifted in the past 12 months to Marib, the last stronghold of Hadi's loyalists.
Around 116,000 people have already left their homes over the last year, and thousands more have been uprooted in recent weeks, the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.
The escalation comes amid renewed efforts to end the war after a dramatic change in the U.S. position towards Saudi Arabia, which leads a military coalition hoping to restore Hadi's government.
The new U.S. administration of President Joe Biden revoked a designation of the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization, imposed by former President Donald Trump, and halted support for offensive operations by the Saudi-led coalition. 
The United States and the U.N. have called on the Houthis to halt the Marib attack, cease all military operations, end cross-border strikes on Saudi Arabia and participate in a U.N.-led peace process.
""The Houthis are clearly taking advantage of Saudi Arabia's isolation after the election of Joe Biden... and its disintegrating coalition,"" said a Western diplomat. 

""It is a big gamble but I also wonder what do they have to lose?""

Activists and U.N. rights experts have said that at least 1 million Muslims are detained in camps in the remote western region. China denies abuses and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.
Raab, in a recorded speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council, said that the rights of people in Hong Kong - a former British colony - were being ""systematically violated"". The national security law imposed by China was inhibiting freedoms, he said, calling for free and fair legislative elections to take place.
""The situation in Xinjiang is beyond the pale,"" he told the Geneva forum where China is among the 47 member states.
""The reported abuses – which include torture, forced labour and forced sterilisation of women – are extreme and they are extensive. They are taking place on an industrial scale,"" he said.
Raab called for U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet or another independent expert to be given ""urgent and unfettered access"" to Xinjiang and said that there should be a resolution at the council to this effect.
The Biden administration has endorsed a last-minute determination by the Trump administration that China has committed genocide in Xinjiang and has said the United States must be prepared to impose costs on China.
Raab told the rights forum the situation in Myanmar was worsening after a military coup on Feb. 1.

""The military must step aside. Civilian leaders must be released. And the democratic wishes of the people of Myanmar must be respected,"" he said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian lawmakers protested on Monday against Tehran's decision to permit “necessary” monitoring by the U.N. nuclear watchdog for up to three months, saying the move broke a law mandating an end to the agency's snap inspections this week. 
""The government has no right to decide and act arbitrarily,"" said Mojtaba Zolnour, chairman of the parliament’s national security committee, according to Iranian state media. 
""This arrangement is an insult to the parliament."" 
Iran has been gradually breaching terms of a 2015 nuclear pact with world powers since then U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from it in 2018 and reimposed sanctions. The pact aims to keep Iran at arm's length from being able to make nuclear arms, which Tehran says it has never wanted to build.
Under the deal, Tehran agreed to implement the Additional Protocol, which allows the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to carry out short-notice inspections at locations not declared to it.
But to pressure President Joe Biden's administration to lift sanctions, Iran's hardline-dominated parliament passed a law last year obliging the government to end implementation of the Protocol from Tuesday if U.S. sanctions are not lifted. 
To create room for diplomacy, the U.N. nuclear watchdog on Sunday reached a deal with Iran to cushion the blow of Iran's reduced cooperation with the agency and its refusal to permit short-notice inspections. 
Under the new agreement, while the number of the IAEA inspectors on the ground will remain the same, Iran has said it will withhold footage recorded by cameras at some of its facilities from the IAEA for the time being, Iranian authorities said. 
Iran has not said which cameras at which facilities, but the Additional Protocol Iran is scrapping does generally extend IAEA monitoring to some activities such as uranium mining.
If Washington lifts the sanctions in that period of up to three months, Iran's IAEA envoy Kazem Gharibabadi tweeted, Iran will share the data with the agency. 
""Otherwise the data will be destroyed by Tehran forever,"" Gharibabadi said on Twitter.
But several prominent lawmakers criticised the agreement, accusing the government of ""bypassing the law"". 
The IAEA, in a statement on Sunday, said it would continue “necessary verification and monitoring activities for up to three months”, without specifying what those activities are.
However, Iran's foreign ministry on Monday said Tehran would continue implementing the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, its core obligations to the agency that allow for monitoring of its declared nuclear facilities.

Both Tehran and Washington say they are willing to come back into compliance with the badly eroded nuclear deal if the other side moves first.

Officials and refugees say Malaysia is set to deport the Myanmar citizens, including asylum-seekers, on Tuesday on three navy ships sent by Myanmar's military, which seized power in a Feb. 1 coup.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has said at least six people registered with it are among the immigration detainees being sent back.
The Malaysian chapters of Amnesty International and Asylum Access said in a statement they had filed for a judicial review at the Kuala Lumpur High Court, based on information indicating asylum seekers and refugees were among those being deported.
The filing, they said, included the names and details of three UNHCR document holders and 17 minors who have at least one parent still in Malaysia.
""Separating children from their parents is an extremely inhuman practice that places these minors at grave risk and goes against the best interest of the child,"" Amnesty Malaysia executive director Katrina Jorene Maliamauv said. 
The Malaysian government, Home Affairs Ministry and Director-General of the Immigration Department were named as respondents in the suit, the groups said. The respondents did not respond to requests for comment. 
Malaysia has said it will not deport Rohingya Muslims or refugees registered with the UNHCR. 
But concerns over deportation of unregistered asylum-seekers persist as the UNHCR has not been allowed to interview detainees for over a year to verify their status.
The deportees include people from Muslim and Chin communities fleeing conflict and persecution at home, refugee groups have said. 

The UNHCR said it had not yet received an official response to its request to access detention centres before the deportation, and could not confirm details of those being deported.

Ethnic Armenian troops in the Nagorno-Karabakh region ceded swathes of territory in and around the enclave to Azerbaijan in a six-week conflict in 2020 that claimed thousands of lives.
Russian peacekeeping troops are deployed in the enclave and, under a formal defence pact with Armenia, Russia has a fully-fledged military base in the city of Gyumri near the Turkish border with an estimated 3,000 troops. 
Russia said in November it was deploying almost 2,000 servicemen as part of the peacekeeping mission.
""The question of expanding and bolstering the Russian military base on the territory of Armenia has always been on the agenda,"" Armenian Defence Minister Vagharshak Harutyunyan told Russia's RIA news agency in an interview published on Monday.
""The Armenian side has always been interested in this.""
Harutyunyan did not say whether there were any concrete plans for a potential expansion.
Armenian opposition politicians have called for the creation of a second Russian base in Armenia's southern Syunik region, wedged between Azerbaijan and the Azeri exclave of Nakhchivan.
Harutyunyan said he saw no need for Russia to formally open a second military base, but said the two countries were considering deploying a military unit from the existing base to eastern Armenia, near the border with Azerbaijan.
Harutyunyan did not disclose the purpose of the potential redeployment nor its exact location.
Russia's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Armenia's opposition, which has called on Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to resign over the outcome of the conflict, planned to stage a fresh street protest on Monday.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened cabinet rivals on Monday for their first discussion of Israeli strategy against the Iranian nuclear programme since U.S. President Joe Biden took office pledging to pursue diplomacy with Tehran. 
Netanyahu's meeting with Defence Minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi followed his first phone call with the U.S. leader last week, and came a month before Israel holds another election triggered by coalition infighting. 
Israeli officials said the conservative Netanyahu, bracing for discord with Biden's Democratic administration on Iran, wanted to present a united front with the centrist Gantz and Ashkenazi.
""This is a matter that is supremely important, certainly more than politicking,"" an Israeli official said. ""We have to ensure everyone is on board and not tempted to speak out of turn in hope of getting more votes.""
Under Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, it undertook to limit its disputed uranium enrichment programme in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions.
When he tussled with then-U.S. President Barack Obama over the deal, Netanyahu faced dissent from some of his own national security advisers. Obama's successor, Donald Trump, quit the deal in 2018, asserting that it was one-sided in Iran's favour, and reimposed sanctions on Tehran - moves welcomed by Netanyahu.
Biden, who was Obama's vice president, wants to rejoin the accord, a prospect Netanyahu and the current Israeli military chief have closed ranks against, as long as Iran ends violations since 2018 and returns to full compliance.
Also on the agenda of Monday's meeting was the possible appointment of a special Israeli envoy on the Iranian issue. 
Candidates include Mossad spymaster Joseph (Yossi) Cohen and National Security Adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat, both of whom took part in the meeting, officials said. As both answer directly to Netanyahu, Gantz had voiced worry the Defence Ministry might be excluded from future diplomacy, one official said.
Gantz and Ashkenazi were kept in the dark about secret Israeli outreach that led to last year's establishment of relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Netanyahu said he feared media leaks. Aides to Gantz and Ashkenazi accused him of trying to undermine the ministers' credibility.
Polls predict a trouncing for Gantz and Ashkenazi's Blue and White party in the March 23 election, and Netanyahu's Likud maintaining enough of a lead to try to form the next coalition.

If the veteran leader fails at that, however, he and his rivals may have to keep working together in a caretaker cabinet.

Museveni, a former guerrilla leader who has led the East African country since 1986, was declared winner of the Jan. 14 election with 59% of the vote, while Wine was given 35%.

RAINI, India (Reuters) - Growing up in a remote tribal village high in the Indian Himalayas, Kundan Singh loved to play on a field by the sparkling Rishiganga river.
The 48-year-old recalls afternoons there competing in sports tournaments, surrounded by forests of pine.
Fifteen years ago, bulldozers descended on Raini village to build a dam, part of a push by India to increase hydroelectric power. The field was lost, and villagers have been in conflict with the Rishiganga Hydropower Project ever since.
The dam was swept away two weeks ago in a flash flood that also smashed bridges and another hydroelectric power station in the Dhauliganga river valley of Uttarakhand state, leaving over 200 feared dead.
Whatever the role of climate change, which is rapidly heating the world's highest mountains, experts say rampant construction is adding to the burden weighing on rural communities across the Himalayas.
This building boom is creating conflict across the region, as shown by interviews with nearly two dozen Raini villagers, legal and technical documents, satellite imagery and photographs, and correspondence with local officials, some of it not previously reported.
“We wrote letters, we protested, we went to court, we did everything,” Singh said. “But no one heard us.” 
JOBS DIDN'T COME
The 150 villagers are members of the Bhutia tribe of historically nomadic shepherds from Tibet, some of whom settled in India after a 1962 war with China closed the border.
Granted protected status with government quotas for jobs and education, many nonetheless live in poverty in the mountainous state, labouring on roads and construction sites, weaving woollen rugs and growing potatoes and pulses on small plots around a bend in the river.
Villagers were initially enthusiastic at the prospect of a power plant that promised jobs, according to court documents, the project’s impact assessment and minutes of a 2006 meeting between village leaders and representatives of the dam.
But the jobs did not come, Singh and other locals said. Those who managed to find work on the dam clashed with the owners over unpaid wages and alleged construction violations, according to court documents.
A paint company from Punjab controlled the dam during initial construction. It has not filed accounts since 2015, and its current directors could not be reached for comment. The project entered bankruptcy before being bought by the Kundan Group in 2018, and finally started operations last year. Executives at the conglomerate did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment. 
As India seeks to nearly double its hydropower capacity by 2030, construction of dams in the region is increasingly leading to disagreements between plant owners and locals, said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, which has studied the conflicts. 
“It happens with many projects,” he said. “People want to resist and oppose, but project developers… will always make promises of employment and development.” 
In the Alaknanda basin, a cluster of streams that feeds the Ganges river – worshipped as a god by many Hindus – six hydroelectric dams have been constructed, according to Thakkar's nonprofit. Eight more, including the Tapovan dam that was severely damaged in the Feb. 7 floods, are under construction, while a further 24 have been proposed. 
A spokeswoman for India’s power ministry said the country has strict measures in place regarding the planning of hydropower projects and the rights of local people are always considered.
MUDDY BANKNOTES, RUBBLE
During the dam’s construction, blasts from explosives were frequent, according to interviews with about 20 residents and court documents.
The use of explosives in construction in the region was criticised after devastating floods in Uttarakhand in 2013, dubbed a ""Himalayan tsunami"" that claimed some 6,000 lives.
In 2019, Singh and his brother took a two-day bus journey to meet with lawyer Abhijay Negi, who recalled them arriving with a bundle of muddy banknotes collected from other residents as payment. 
“Please help us save our village,” Singh told him. 
Negi helped the men file a case against the Kundan Group unit operating the dam, alleging construction had left behind loose rubble and rocks, according to photographs and diagrams submitted as evidence. 
Uttarakhand’s top court ruled there was evidence of “substantial damage” to the area that suggested explosives were being used for illegal mining, though it did not rule on when the damage occurred. The court ordered a local investigation, but it is not clear if this has happened and officials involved could not be reached.
High up on the mountain, almost all the Raini residents survived the floods. But Singh said the disaster has left many dreaming of escape. 

“Many want to leave, but I will stay because I have no other option,” he said. “I will stay because of poverty.”

For almost 50 years, the royal family have attended an annual Commonwealth Day service at London's Westminster Abbey in March, but it has been cancelled this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Instead, the 94-year-old monarch, who heads the association of 54 nations, will deliver a televised message as part of a programme entitled ""A Celebration for Commonwealth Day"", which will be broadcast on the BBC on March 7, the Abbey said.
There will also be contributions from heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and from the next in line, Prince William, with his wife Kate.
That means it will air hours before Harry and Meghan's much anticipated tell-all, their first in-depth interview since they moved to the United States, will be broadcast on CBS. 
Winfrey's scoop comes at a time when the couple have been making international headlines with the announcement that they are expecting a second child and news that they are quitting their royal roles for good.
""We are so pleased that this rich and vibrant BBC programme with the Royal Family and the Abbey at its heart will celebrate our global connections at a time when we are all so physically isolated,"" said David Hoyle, the Dean of Westminster. 
Harry and Meghan attended the Commonwealth Day service in person last year. It was their final official royal engagement before they moved to Los Angeles and stepped away from official duties, a decision that sent shockwaves through the monarchy.

Last week, Buckingham Palace announced that the couple would not be returning and that their treasured royal patronages would revert to the queen and be distributed among other family members.

BAGHADAD (Reuters) - Pope Francis is due to hold an inter-religious prayer service at the ancient Mesopotamian site of Ur when he visits Iraq next week - an event local archeologists hope will draw renewed attention to the place revered as the birthplace of Abraham.
Popular with Western visitors in the 1970s and 1980s, Ur is scarcely visited today after decades of war and political instability shattered Iraq's international tourism industry. The coronavirus crisis now also keeps local tourists away.
Located about 300 km (200 miles) south of the capital Baghdad, the site comprises a pyramid-style Ziggurat and an adjacent residential complex as well as temples and palaces. 
It was excavated about 100 years ago by Leonard Woolley, a Briton who recovered treasures rivalling those found in Tutankhamen's tomb in Egypt. But little work has since been done 
on one of the world's oldest cities, where urban dwelling, writing and central state power began.
According to the State Board for Antiquities and Heritage director for Ur, Ali Kadhim Ghanim, the complex next to the Ziggurat dates back to about 1900 BC.
The father of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, Abraham is described in the biblical book of Genesis as living in the city before God called upon him to create a new nation in a land he later learned was Canaan.
""This is why it is believed that this building, or house, was the house of the prophet Abraham,"" Ghanim said, pointing at the residential complex. 
According to Ghanim, the housing settlement was restored in 1999, after Pope Francis' predecessor, Pope John Paul II, announced a trip to Iraq. But his visit was cancelled when negotiations with the government of then-Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein broke down.
This time, Ghanim hopes that Pope Francis' visit will attract international attention to the site, which he says is badly needed to fund restoration works on its palaces and temples.
""Not only tourism, but we believe that there will be a Christian pilgrimage season,"" Ghanim said.
Un Ponte Per, an Italian-based organisation, is working with the United Nations Development Programme on infrastructure works such as paths, rest areas and signposts to help visitors.
Roads around the site are being rennovated and powerlines extended ahead of the pope's visit.
But without adequate funding, Ghanim says his administration has been limited to containing further damage to the site, such as digging trenches to divert rainwater from the ruins.
Basra's Archbishop Habib al-Naufaly stressed the symbolic importance of the pope's March 5-8 visit as Iraq is still recovering from the war against Islamic State that destroyed scores of Christian heritage sites.
The inter-religious prayer service will be attended by Christians, Muslims, Mandaean-Sabaean, Yazidi and other religious minorities present in Iraq.

The focus will be on harmony between religious groups in a service the Vatican has named ""Prayer for the sons and daughters of Abraham"".

LAIKIPIA (Reuters) - Kenya is battling some of the worst locust plagues in decades, but start-up The Bug Picture hopes to transform the pests into profits and bring ""hope to the hopeless"" whose crops and livelihoods are being destroyed by the insects.
Unusual weather patterns exacerbated by climate change have created ideal conditions for surging locust numbers, which have destroyed crops and grazing grounds across East Africa and the Horn.
Scientists say warmer seas are creating more rain, waking dormant eggs, and cyclones that disperse the swarms are getting stronger and more frequent.
The Bug Picture is working with communities around the area of Laikipia, Isiolo and Samburu in central Kenya to harvest the insects and mill them, turning them into protein-rich animal feed and organic fertilizer for farms.
""We are trying to create hope in a hopeless situation, and help these communities alter their perspective to see these insects as a seasonal crop that can be harvested and sold for money,"" said Laura Stanford, founder of The Bug Picture. 
In central Kenya's Laikipia, clouds of locusts are devouring crops and other vegetation. The Bug Picture is targeting swarms of 5 hectares or less in inhabited areas not suitable for spraying.
Swarms can travel up to 150 km (93 miles) a day and can contain between 40-80 million locusts per square kilometre.
""They destroy all the crops when they get into the farms. Sometimes they are so many, you cannot tell them apart, which are crops and which are locusts,"" said farmer Joseph Mejia.
The Bug Picture pays Mejia and his neighbours 50 Kenyan shillings ($0.4566) per kilogram of the insects. Between Feb. 1-18, the project oversaw the harvest of 1.3 tons of locusts, according to Stanford, who said she was inspired by a project in Pakistan, overseen by the state-run Pakistan Agricultural Research Council. 
The locusts are collected at night by torchlight when they are resting on shrubs and trees.
""The community ... are collecting locusts, once they (are collected) they are weighed and paid,"" said Albert Lemasulani, a field coordinator with the start-up.

The insects are crushed and dried, then milled and processed into powder, which is used in animal feed or an organic fertiliser.

Any changes could further limit who could run in a postponed legislative election and may lead to the disqualification of most lower-level district councillors - the majority of them being pro-democracy politicians, sources have told Reuters. 
Reforms could also further skew a committee electing the city's leader in favour of the pro-Beijing camp.
""Patriots"" included those who loved China, its constitution and the Communist Party and excluded anti-China ""troublemakers"", said Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, China's cabinet.
One direct reason for ""anti China"" movements in Hong Kong was that the principle of patriots ruling the city was not fully implemented, Xia said. 
""Relevant legal loopholes"" should be plugged to improve Hong Kong's electoral system and ensure only patriots gain important office, said Xia, according to a transcript of his remarks posted online by his office.
Those who violate the national security law, or challenge the leadership of the ruling Communist Party, are not patriots, he said, referring to the contentious legislation Beijing imposed on its freest city in June last year.
Patriots would also resolutely oppose foreign interference in Hong Kong, he said. 
""Under no circumstances should important positions be held by elements who are anti-China or who bring chaos to Hong Kong."" 
A Hong Kong deputy to China's parliament, which is due to congregate from March 5, said that it was likely a ""detailed electoral reform plan"" for the city will be brought up this year, according to a tweet from the Global Times, a tabloid published by the official People's Daily, on Monday.
The ""patriotism"" requirement for the city's fiercely independent judiciary would be of particular concern for many in Hong Kong, as its common law-based system has been key to establish the city as a global financial hub. 
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said her government would fully co-operate with Beijing in its role in improving the former British colony's political system.

""You have to be a very firm and decisive patriot to the extent that you're prepared to put in every effort to defend ""one country, two systems,"" regardless of your personal sacrifices,"" Lam said, referring to the semi-autonomous city's style of governance.

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 04:40AM ET</span>",Germany urges EU to prepare sanctions on Russia over Navalny,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Monday urged his EU counterparts to give the green light to sanctions against Russian officials responsible for jailing Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and cracking down on pro-democracy activists.
Berlin's call paves the way for sanctions to be imposed next month in what the 27-member bloc says should be seen as a message to President Vladimir Putin that debate and protest must be allowed in Russia.
""I am in favour of ordering the preparation of additional sanctions, of listings of specific persons,"" Maas said as he arrived in Brussels. He said sanctions were pressing because Navalny had not only been sentenced to a prison term earlier this month, but also to serve this term in a labour camp.
Diplomats expect the EU to impose travel bans and asset freezes on allies of Putin next month, once experts have gathered evidence to withstand any legal challenges.
A group of EU foreign ministers met Navalny's chief of staff Leonid Volkov in Brussels on Sunday to build their case for punitive steps against Russia, which is already under Western economic sanctions after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.
EU foreign ministers will also hold a video call with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken later on Monday.
""We cannot turn a blind eye to blatant breaches of human rights violations in Russia,"" Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said after Sunday's meeting.
Slovak Foreign Minister Ivan Korcok echoed the mood of many EU diplomats, saying on arrival in Brussels on Monday: ""I do not see that the European Union is responsible for the confrontational course that Russia has taken.""
Navalny was detained after returning to Russia from Germany last month and jailed on Feb. 2 for violating the terms of parole on what he says was a politically motivated conviction. Moscow denies wrongdoing and accuses the EU of meddling in its affairs.
In Germany Navalny had been recovering from being poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent. Navalny said Russian state security agents had put the poison in his underpants, something the Kremlin denied. 
Pressure for sanctions has grown since Moscow infuriated European countries on Feb. 5 by expelling German, Polish and Swedish diplomats without telling the EU’s foreign policy chief, who was in Moscow for a visit. 
Still, Maas said he believed the EU needed to keep up some kind of diplomacy with Moscow. 

""At the same time we need to talk about how to keep up a constructive dialogue with Russia, even as relations certainly have reached a low,"" Maas said.
